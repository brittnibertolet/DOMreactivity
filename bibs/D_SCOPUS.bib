abstract={Incomplete combustion of organics such as vegetation or fossil fuel led to accumulation of charred products in the upper soil horizon. Such charred products, frequently called pyrogenic carbon or black carbon (BC), may act as an important long-term carbon (C) sink because its microbial decomposition and chemical transformation is probably very slow. Direct estimations of BC decomposition rates are absent because the BC content changes are too small for any relevant experimental period. Estimations based on CO2 efflux are also unsuitable because the contribution of BC to CO2 is too small compared to soil organic matter (SOM) and other sources. We produced BC by charring 14C labeled residues of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). We then incubated this 14C labeled BC in Ah of a Haplic Luvisol soil originated from loess or in loess for 3.2 years. The decomposition rates of BC were estimated based on 14CO2 sampled 44 times during the 3.2 years incubation period (1181 days). Additionally we introduced five repeated treatments with either 1) addition of glucose as an energy source for microorganisms to initiate cometabolic BC decomposition or 2) intensive mixing of the soil to check the effect of mechanical disturbance of aggregates on BC decomposition. Black carbon addition amounting to 20% of Corg of the soil or 200% of Corg of loess did not change total CO2 efflux from the soil and slightly decreased it from the loess. This shows a very low BC contribution to recent CO2 fluxes. The decomposition rates of BC calculated based on 14C in CO2 were similar in soil and in loess and amounted to 1.36 10-5 d-1 (=1.36 10-3% d-1). This corresponds to a decomposition of about 0.5% BC per year under optimal conditions. Considering about 10 times slower decomposition of BC under natural conditions, the mean residence time (MRT) of BC is about 2000 years, and the half-life is about 1400 years. Considering the short duration of the incubation and the typical decreasing decomposition rates with time, we conclude that the MRT of BC in soils is in the range of millennia. The strong increase in BC decomposition rates (up to 6 times) after adding glucose and the decrease of this stimulation after 2 weeks in the soil (and after 3 months in loess) allowed us to conclude cometabolic BC decomposition. This was supported by higher stimulation of BC decomposition by glucose addition compared to mechanical disturbance as well as higher glucose effects in loess compared to the soil. The effect of mechanical disturbance was over within 2 weeks. The incorporation of BC into microorganisms (fumigation/extraction) after 624 days of incubation amounted to 2.6 and 1.5% of 14C input into soil and loess, respectively. The amount of BC in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was below the detection limit (&lt;0.01%) showing no BC decomposition products in water leached from the soil. We conclude that applying 14C labeled BC opens new ways for very sensitive tracing of BC transformation products in released CO2, microbial biomass, DOC, and SOM pools with various properties. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={A large pool of organic carbon resides in the world's oceans in the form of dissolved organic' matter (DOM). DOM is operationally defined as the fraction of organic matter that passes through a filter with a given pore size (which can range from less than 0.1 μm to 0.46 μm). This fraction has a longer oceanic residence time - and is generally less biodegradable - than particulate organic matter (POM). Processes transforming DOM into POM are therefore crucial for our understanding of the cycling of organic material in the oceans. The aggregation of marine colloids, which constitute 10-40% of DOM, is thought to be an important step in the transformation of DOM into POM. It has been suggested that colloids, as well as transparent exopolymer particles and large aggregates ('marine snow') can be viewed as polymer gels. Whether free DOM polymers can indeed spontaneously assemble to form polymer gels has, however, not yet been shown. Here we present experimental observations that demonstrate that marine polymer gels can assemble from free DOM polymers, and that their formation mechanism, physical characteristics and mineralization can be understood in terms of polymer gel theory. The principles and methods of polymer gel physics thus have the potential to provide profound new insights into the processes controlling the exchange between the DOM and POM pools and the cycling of marine organic matter.

abstract={Factors affecting sorption of organic pollutants by natural sorbents (soils, sediments, clays, humic materials, and dissolved organic matters) and sorption coefficients for selected pollutants are reviewed on the basis of the literature results and interpretations; with 681 references examined. The most significant aspects of the sorption process are discussed: sorption isotherms and sorption kinetics; effects of sorbent physico-chemical characteristics (pH, cation exchange capacity, ionic strength, surface area, etc.); effect of the temperature; sorption of volatile compounds; effect of the presence of a cosolvent; association with dissolved organic matter; effect of the sorbent concentration; "hysteresis" or nonsingularity in the sorption-desorption process, and its implications in the transport of these contaminants through soil columns. The experimental and prediction methods adopted for the determination and estimation of the sorption coefficients are also described. Literature sorption coefficients for selected hydrophobic, polar, and ionizable compounds are collected. The compounds taken into consideration belong to the following classes: monoarornatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated alkyl and aryl compounds, phenol and chlorinated phenols, polychlorobiphenyls, dioxins, and pesticides. The respective sorption coefficients (logKd) and organic carbon-referenced sorption coefficients (log Koc) are tabulated together with the most relevant characteristics of the respective sorbent, the measurement temperature, and the experimental methods. The log Koc values are averaged and compared with other experimental and estimated literature data. Differences of sorption coefficients on soils and sediments and effect of pH on sorption coefficients for ionizable compounds are evidentiated. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={High concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were leached into rainwater passing through an oak hickory forest in the southern Appalachian Mountains. More than 95% of this dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON) was removed as water percolated through the soil profile. The importance of decomposition in the removal of DOC and DON was studied. The relative order of average decomposition of DOC from the various strata was, from fastest to slowest: throughfall, Oi horizon (forest floor), Oa horizon (forest floor), B horizon, AB horizon , and upper A horizon. In short, biodegradability decline vertically from throughfall to the A horizon and then increased with depth. Throughfall DOM could be decomposed during its passage through the upper soil, but adsorption rather than decomposition seems to be responsible for the bulk of removal of DON and DOC that occurs in the mineral soil. -from Authors},

abstract={PAHs are mainly produced by combustion processes and consist of a number of toxic compounds. While the concentrations of individual PAHs in soil produced by natural processes (e.g., vegetation fires, volcanic exhalations) are estimated to be around 1-10 μg kg-1, recently measured lowest concentrations are frequently 10 times higher. Organic horizons of forest soils and urban soils may even reach individual PAH concentrations of several 100 μg kg-1. The PAH mixture in temperate soils is often dominated by benzofluoranthenes, chrysene, and fluoranthene. The few existing studies on tropical soils indicate that the PAH concentrations are relatively lower than in temperate soils for most compounds except for naphthalene, phenanthrene, and perylene suggesting the presence of unidentified PAH sources. PAHs accumulate in C-rich topsoils, in the stemfoot area, at aggregate surfaces, and in the fine-textured particle fractions, particularly the silt fraction. PAHs are mainly associated with soil organic matter (SOM) and soot-like C. Although the water-solubility of PAHs is low, they are encountered in the subsoil suggesting that they are transported in association with dissolved organic matter (DOM). The uptake of PAHs by plants is small. Most PAHs detected in plant tissue are from atmospheric deposition. However, earthworms bioaccumulate considerable amounts of PAHs in short periods. The reviewed work illustrates that there is a paucity of data on the global distribution of PAHs, particularly with respect to tropical and southern hemispheric regions. Reliable methods to characterize bioavailable PAH pools in soil still need to be developed. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 2000.},

abstract={A study of 16 streams in eastern North America shows that riparian deforestation causes channel narrowing, which reduces the total amount of stream habitat and ecosystem per unit channel length and compromises in-stream processing of pollutants. Wide forest reaches had more macroinvertebrates, total ecosystem processing of organic matter, and nitrogen uptake per unit channel length than contiguous narrow deforested reaches. Stream narrowing nullified any potential advantages of deforestation regarding abundance of fish, quality of dissolved organic matter, and pesticide degradation. These findings show that forested stream channels have a wider and more natural configuration, which significantly affects the total in-stream amount and activity of the ecosystem, including the processing of pollutants. The results reinforce both current policy of the United States that endorses riparian forest buffers as best management practice and federal and state programs that subsidize riparian reforestation for stream restoration and water quality. Not only do forest buffers prevent nonpoint source pollutants from entering small streams, they also enhance the in-stream processing of both nonpoint and point source pollutants, thereby reducing their impact on downstream rivers and estuaries.},

abstract={Surface water samples were collected from 43 streams distributed throughout watersheds of mixed land use in southern Ontario, Canada. Absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM characteristics were related to environmental variables, microbial activity indicators (bacterial production and extracellular leucine aminopeptidase activity), and riparian land use to understand better how these factors influence DOM in streams. PARAFAC produced a six-component model (Cl to C6). Temperature correlated with each PARAFAC component, suggesting that water source, drainage area, and light penetration broadly affected DOM characteristics. Cl and C2 represented terrestrial, humic-like DOM fluorophore groups and comprised 41-65% of stream DOM fluorescence. C5, a tryptophan-like component, related negatively to a humification index but positively to leucine-aminopeptidase activity and recently produced DOM, suggesting that C5 consisted of autochthonous, microbially produced DOM. C3, C4, and C6 showed signs of quinone-like, humic-like, and microbial transformable fluorophores. The distribution of these potentially redox-active PARAFAC components indicated that DOM was in a more reduced state in streams with higher bacterial production and agricultural land use than in streams with increased wetlands area, which had greater relative abundance of the oxidized quinone-like component. Anthropogenic land use and microbial activity altered the quantity and quality of DOM exported from human-affected streams from that observed in forest- and wetland-dominated streams. DOM in agriculturally affected streams was likely more labile and accessible to the microbial community than DOM in wetland streams, which supported low rates of microbial activity. © 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract={The chemical structure of refractory marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is still largely unknown. Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR-MS) was used to resolve the complex mixtures of DOM and provide valuable information on elemental compositions on a molecular scale. We characterized and compared DOM from two sharply contrasting aquatic environments, algal-derived DOM from the Weddell Sea (Antarctica) and terrigenous DOM from pore water of a tropical mangrove area in northern Brazil. Several thousand molecular formulas in the mass range of 300-600 Da were identified and reproduced in element ratio plots. On the basis of molecular elemental composition and double-bond equivalents (DBE) we calculated an average composition for marine DOM. O/C ratios in the marine samples were lower (0.36 ± 0.01) than in the mangrove pore-water sample (0.42). A small proportion of chemical formulas with higher molecular mass in the marine samples were characterized by very low O/C and H/C ratios probably reflecting amphiphilic properties. The average number of unsaturations in the marine samples was surprisingly high (DBE = 9.9; mangrove pore water: DBE = 9.4) most likely due to a significant contribution of carbonyl carbon. There was no significant difference in elemental composition between surface and deep-water DOM in the Weddell Sea. Although there were some molecules with unique marine elemental composition, there was a conspicuous degree of similarity between the terrigenous and algal-derived end members. Approximately one third of the molecular formulas were present in all marine as well as in the mangrove samples. We infer that different forms of microbial degradation ultimately lead to similar structural features that are intrinsically refractory, independent of the source of the organic matter and the environmental conditions where degradation took place.

abstract={A field study of the tidal currents, cohesive sediment dynamics and transport of organic carbon in a highly vegetated mangrove swamp was carried out at Middle Creek, Cairns, Australia. The interaction of tidal currents and the vegetation generated jets, eddies and zones of stagnant waters which were numerically modelled. A high value of the Manning friction coefficient (n = 0.1) was derived by the dense vegetation. About 80% of the suspended sediment brought in from coastal waters at spring flood tide was trapped in the mangroves, corresponding to about 10-12 kg of sediment m-1 creek length/spring tide, resulting in a rise of the substrate by about 0.1 cm year-1. The selective trapping of clay was caused by flocculation of the finer particles in the mangroves. There was an indication of a slight inwelling of organic carbon. Creek water was readily differentiated from mangrove water by large differences in the molecular weight distribution of the dissolved organic carbon.},

abstract={Riverine organic matter supports of the order of one-fifth of estuarine metabolism. Coastal ecosystems are therefore sensitive to alteration of both the quantity and lability of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) delivered by rivers. The lability of DOM is thought to vary with age, with younger, relatively unaltered organic matter being more easily metabolized by aquatic heterotrophs than older, heavily modified material. This view is developed exclusively from work in watersheds where terrestrial plant and soil sources dominate streamwater DOM. Here we characterize streamwater DOM from 11 coastal watersheds on the Gulf of Alaska that vary widely in glacier coverage (0-64 per cent). In contrast to non-glacial rivers, we find that the bioavailability of DOM to marine microorganisms is significantly correlated with increasing 14 C age. Moreover, the most heavily glaciated watersheds are the source of the oldest (4 kyr 14 C age) and most labile (66 per cent bioavailable) DOM. These glacial watersheds have extreme runoff rates, in part because they are subject to some of the highest rates of glacier volume loss on Earth. We estimate the cumulative flux of dissolved organic carbon derived from glaciers contributing runoff to the Gulf of Alaska at 0.13 0.01 Tg yr-1 (1 Tg = 10 12 g), of which 0.10 Tg is highly labile. This indicates that glacial runoff is a quantitatively important source of labile reduced carbon to marine ecosystems. Moreover, because glaciers and ice sheets represent the second largest reservoir of water in the global hydrologic system, our findings indicate that climatically driven changes in glacier volume could alter the age, quantity and reactivity of DOM entering coastal oceans. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={Biochar has shown promise as a soil amendment that increases carbon sequestration and fertility, but its effects on dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling and loss is not well understood. Here, nutrient release from a variety of new and aged biochars, pure and mixed with soils, is examined using batch extraction and column leaching. In successive batch extractions of biochar, cumulative losses were about 0.1-2, 0.5-8 and 5-100% of the total C, N and P initially present, respectively, with greater releases from biochars made at lower temperature and from grass. Ammonium was usually the most abundant N form in leachates but nitrate was also abundant in some biochars, while organic N and P represented as much as 61% and 93% of the total N and P lost, respectively. Release of DOC, N and P into water was correlated with biochar volatile matter content and acid functional group density. However, P release via Mehlich-1 extraction was more strongly related to ash content, suggesting a mineral-associated P fraction. Columns with soil/biochar mixtures showed evidence of both soil nutrient sorption by biochar and biochar nutrient sorption by soil, depending upon biochar and soil type. This study demonstrates that biochars contain a range of nutrient forms with different release rates, explaining biochar's variable effect on soil fertility with soil and crop type and over time. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Composting is the biochemical transformation of waste organic matter by microorganisms whose metabolism occurs in the water-soluble phase. Therefore, a study of the changes occurring in compost dissolved organic matter can be useful for assessing its stability and maturity. In light of the variety of parameters generally utilized to study composting processes, this work aims at identifying the major chemical processes that occur in solution and their influence on the attainment of stability and maturity with composting time. Compost stability, assessed by means of respirometric analysis which determined oxygen demand as a result of mineralization of the compost's organic matter, and compost maturity evaluated with Lepidium sativum L. seed bioassays, were found to be highly related to the nature and content of water-soluble organic matter. Moreover, fractionation of the water-extractable organic carbon showed that the ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic carbon increased to values greater than unity for stabilized compost. These results together with the analysis for non-cellulosic polysaccharides, phenolic compounds and organic nitrogen within the water extracts, confirmed the influence of solubilization, mineralization and organic matter transformation on the quality of the final compost. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The arsenic contamination of aquifers has been linked to the input of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In light of this suggestion, the aim of this study was to quantify chemical effects of DOM on desorption and redox transformations of arsenic bound to synthetic iron oxide and natural samples from different geochemical environments (soils, shallow aquifer, lake sediment). In batch experiments, solutions containing 25-50 mg/L of two different types of DOM (purified peat humic acid and DOM from a peat drainage) were used as extractants in comparison to inorganic solutions. DOM solution was able to mobilize arsenic from all solid phases. Mobilization from iron oxides (maximum: 53.3%) was larger than from natural samples (maximum: 2.9%). The mobilization effect of extractants decreased in the order HCl &gt; NaH2PO 4 &gt; DOM &gt; NaNO3. DOM solutions, therefore, mainly targeted weakly sorbed arsenic. Mobilization was complete within 24-36 h and DOM was sorbed during incubation indicating competition for sorption sites. The same patterns were observed for different DOM types and concentrations. Addition of DOM lead to (a) enhanced reduction (maximum 7.8%) and oxidation (6.4%) of arsenic in aqueous solution and (b) the appearance of arsenite in aqueous phase of soil samples (5.5%). As the primary mechanism for the arsenic release from solid phases we identified the competition between arsenic and organic anions for sorption sites, whereas redox reactions were probably of minor importance. The results of this study demonstrate that sorption of DOM has a strong potential to mobilize arsenic from soils and sediments. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Northern peatlands play an important role globally in the cycling of C, through the exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere, the emission of CH4, the production and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the storage of C. Under 2 x CO2 GCM scenarios, most Canadian peatlands will be exposed to increases in mean annual temperature ranging between 2 and 6°C and increases in mean annual precipitation of 0 to 15 %, with the most pronounced changes occurring during the winter. The increase in CO2 uptake by plants, through warmer temperatures and elevated atmospheric CO2, is likely to be offset by increased soil respiration rates in response to warmer soils and lowered water tables. CH4 emissions are likely to decrease in most peatlands because of lowered water tables, except where the peat surface adjusts to fluctuating water tables, and in permafrost, where the collapse of dry plateau and palsa will lead to increased CH4 emission. There likely will be little change in DOC production, but DOC export to water bodies will decrease as runoff decreases. The storage of C in peatlands is sensitive to all C cycle components and is difficult to predict. The challenge is to develop quantitative models capable of making these predictions for different peatlands. We present some qualitative responses, with levels of uncertainty. There will be, however, as much variation in response to climatic change within a peatland as there will be among peatland regions.},

abstract={The main process by which dissolved organic matter (DOM) is retained in forest soils is likely to be sorption in the mineral horizons that adds to stabilized organic matter (OM) pools. The objectives of this study were to determine the extent of degradation of sorbed OM and to investigate changes in its composition during degradation. DOM of different origins was sorbed to a subsoil and incubated for 1 year. We quantified mineralized C by frequent CO2 measurements in the headspace of the incubation vessels and calculated mean residence times by a double exponential model. Mineralization of C of the corresponding DOM in solution was used as a control to estimate the extent of DOM stabilization by sorption. Changes in the composition of sorbed OM during the incubation were studied by spectroscopic (UV, fluorescence) and isotope (13C, 14C) measurements after hot-water extraction of OM. The fraction of sorbed organic C mineralized during the incubation was only one-third to one-sixth of that mineralized in solution. The mean residence time of the most stable OM sample was estimated to increase from 28 years in solution to 91 years after sorption. For highly degradable DOM samples, the portion of stable C calculated by a double exponential model nearly doubled upon sorption. With less degradable DOM the stability increased by only 20% after sorption. Therefore, the increase in stability due to sorption is large for labile DOM high in carbohydrates and relatively small for stable DOM high in aromatic and complex molecules. Nevertheless, in terms of stability the rank order of OM types after sorption was the same as in solution. Furthermore, the extent of sorption of recalcitrant compounds was much larger than sorption of labile compounds. Thus, sorptive stabilization of this stable DOM sample was four times larger than for the labile ones. We conclude that stabilization of OM by sorption depends on the intrinsic stability of organic compounds sorbed. We propose that the main stabilization processes are selective sorption of intrinsically stable compounds and strong chemical bonds to the mineral soil and/or a physical inaccessibility of OM to microorganisms. The UV, fluorescence and 13C measurements indicated that aromatic and complex compounds, probably derived from lignin, were preferentially stabilized by sorption of DOM. The 13C and 14C data showed that degradation of the indigenous OM in the mineral soil decreased after sorption of DOM. We estimated DOM sorption stabilizes about 24 Mg C ha-1 highlighting the importance of sorption for accumulation and preservation of OM in soil. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article reports responses of two different forest ecosystems to 9 years (1988-96) of chronic nitrogen (N) additions at the Harvard Forest, Petersham, Massachusetts. Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) was applied to a pine plantation and a native deciduous broad-leaved (hardwood) forest in six equal monthly doses (May-September) at four rates: control (no fertilizer addition), low N (5 g N m-2 y-1), high N (15 g N m-2 y-1), and low N + sulfur (5 g N m-2 y-1 plus 7.4 g S m-2 y-1). Measurements were made of net N mineralization, net nitrification, N retention, wood production, foliar N content and litter production, soil C and N content, and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) in soil water. In the pine stand, nitrate losses were measured after the first year of additions (1989) in the high N plot and increased again in 1995 and 1996. The hardwood stand showed no significant increases in nitrate leaching until 1995 (high N only), with further increases in 1996. Overall N retention efficiency (percentage of added N retained) over the 9-year period was 97-100% in the control and low N plots of both stands, 96% in the hardwood high N plot, and 85% in the pine high N plot. Storage in aboveground biomass, fine roots, and soil extractable pools accounted for only 1632% of the added N retained in the amended plots, suggesting that the one major unmeasured pool, soil organic matter, contains the remaining 68-84%. Short-term redistribution of 15N tracer at natural abundance levels showed similar division between plant and soil pools. Direct measurements of changes in total soil C and N pools were inconclusive due to high variation in both stands. Woody biomass production increased in the hardwood high N plot but was significantly reduced in the pine high N plot, relative to controls. A drought-induced increase in foliar litterfall in the pine stand in 1995 is one possible factor leading to a measured increase in N mineralization, nitrification, and nitrate loss in the pine high N plot in 1996.},

abstract={Climate warming is having a dramatic effect on the vegetation distribution and carbon cycling of terrestrial subarctic and arctic ecosystems. Here, we present hydrologic evidence that warming is also affecting the export of dissolved organic carbon and bicarbonate (DOC and HCO3-) at the large basin scale. In the 831,400 km2 Yukon River basin, water discharge (Q) corrected DOC export significantly decreased during the growing season from 1978-80 to 2001-03, indicating a major shift in terrestrial to aquatic C transfer. We conclude that decreased DOC export, relative to total summer through autumn Q, results from increased flow path, residence time, and microbial mineralization of DOC in the soil active layer and groundwater. Counter to current predictions, we argue that continued warming could result in decreased DOC export to the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean by major subarctic and arctic rivers, due to increased respiration of organic C on land.

abstract={Several types of vegetables were collected from two contaminated sites in Tianjin, China. The bulk soil and the rhizosphere soil samples were also collected from the same plots. Sixteen PAHs in the samples were measured. The total concentrations of PAH16 in the bulk soil from the two sites were 1.08 and 6.25 μg/g, respectively, with similar pattern. The concentrations of PAH16 and individual compounds in the rhizosphere were significantly higher than those in the bulk soil with mean values of 2.25 and 7.82 μg/g for the two sites, respectively. The contents of both total and dissolved organic matter in the rhizosphere were also higher than those in the bulk soil. Almost all PAH compounds studied were detected in both roots and aerial parts of the vegetables studied. Abundance of higher molecular weight PAHs in vegetable, however, was lower than that in soil. Concentrations of PAH16 in vegetable were higher than those reported in the literature for other areas. It appears that agricultural soils and vegetables in Tianjin, especially those from the site located immediately next to an urban district and irrigated with wastewater for several decades, are severely contaminated by PAHs. Among the eight types of vegetable studied, the highest concentration of PAHs was found in cauliflower. By average, the concentration of PAH16 in the aerial part of vegetables was 6.5 times higher as that in vegetable root, suggesting that foliar uptake is the primary transfer pathway of PAHs from environment to vegetables. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Carbon in thawing permafrost soils may have global impacts on climate change; however, the factors that control its processing and fate are poorly understood. The dominant fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from soils to inland waters is either complete oxidation to CO2 or partial oxidation and river export to oceans. Although both processes are most often attributed to bacterial respiration, we found that photochemical oxidation exceeds rates of respiration and accounts for 70 to 95% of total DOC processed in the water column of arctic lakes and rivers. At the basin scale, photochemical processing of DOC is about one-third of the total CO2 released from surface waters and is thus an important component of the arctic carbon budget.},

abstract={Cattle manure is produced in large quantities in industrial breeding facilities and the storage and/or spreading of this waste on land may cause contamination of the atmosphere, soil and water. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the active phases of composting, vermicomposting, and also a combination of composting and vermicomposting for reducing the polluting potential and for stabilizing cattle manure in the short-term. For this, the degree of decomposition as well as the microbial activity and microbial composition of the resulting products after the active phase of composting and vermicomposting were analysed. None of the treatments significantly reduced the dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen contents relative to the control, and therefore more time may be required for stabilization. Nevertheless, the lowest values of microbial biomass and activity corresponded to the earthworm-worked substrates, in which fungal growth was also promoted; the combined treatment (composting + vermicomposting) was the most effective in terms of stabilizing the cattle manure. Moreover, earthworms promoted the retention of nitrogen and gradual release of P, as well as a reduction in electrical conductivity, thereby producing improved substrates for agricultural use. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Organic matter decomposition and soil CO2 efflux are both mediated by soil microorganisms, but the potential effects of temporal variations in microbial community composition are not considered in most analytical models of these two important processes. However, inconsistent relationships between rates of heterotrophic soil respiration and abiotic factors, including temperature and moisture, suggest that microbial community composition may be an important regulator of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and CO2 efflux. We performed a short-term (12-h) laboratory incubation experiment using tropical rain forest soil amended with either water (as a control) or dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from native plant litter, and analyzed the effects of the treatments on soil respiration and microbial community composition. The latter was determined by constructing clone libraries of small-subunit ribosomal RNA genes (SSU rRNA) extracted from the soil at the end of the incubation experiment. In contrast to the subtle effects of adding water alone, additions of DOM caused a rapid and large increase in soil CO2 flux. DOM-stimulated CO2 fluxes also coincided with profound shifts in the abundance of certain members of the soil microbial community. Our results suggest that natural DOM inputs may drive high rates of soil respiration by stimulating an opportunistic subset of the soil bacterial community, particularly members of the Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes groups. Our experiment indicates that variations in microbial community composition may influence SOM decomposition and soil respiration rates, and emphasizes the need for in situ studies of how natural variations in microbial community composition regulate soil biogeochemical processes. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={A cross-system comparison of organic carbon origin and behaviour in nine European estuaries is presented. The study sites display a very large range of hydrological and environmental conditions. The watershed of the respective estuaries were characterized by plotting the total organic carbon (TOC) in the rivers versus the inhabitants/discharge ratio. This allows to distinguish four types of watershed with regard to anthropogenic forcing and organic carbon levels: polluted by sewage inputs (Scheldt and to a much lesser extent, Ems, Sado and Thames), decontaminated (Elbe and Rhine), pristine (Gironde and Douro) and eutrophized (Loire and Scheldt). In the estuarine zone, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) almost always decreased linearly with increasing salinity. Exceptions were: the Scheldt, where a net consumption of sewage-derived DOC was observed, the Gironde, where a net production of DOC occurred in the maximum turbidity zone (MTZ) and the Sado and Ems, where DOC was supplied from large intertidal areas. By contrast, a large fraction of the riverine particulate organic carbon (POC) was mineralized in all the estuaries, except the Douro, where residence time of waters is only a few days. A fraction of POC appeared however refractory and accumulated in the MTZs, where terrestrial soil-derived material dominates (Elbe, Ems, Loire, Gironde and Sado). In the marine regions of most estuaries, autochthonous POC was present during spring and summer. The analysis of all river and estuarine data allows estimation of the loss of continental POC occurring in each estuary. It decreases in the following order: Scheldt> Thames>Ems=Sado=Loire>Gironde>Elbe>Rhine>Douro, which almost corresponds to the anthropogenic pressure in the respective watersheds. Two major variables appear to control the intensity of this mineralization: the origin of the POC, the lability increasing with pollution, and the residence time of particles in the estuarine zone. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={Prediction of the fate of metals in soil requires knowledge of their solid-liquid partitioning. This paper reviews analytical methods and models for measuring or predicting the solid-liquid partitioning of metals in aerobic soils, and collates experimental data. The partitioning is often expressed with an empirical distribution coefficient or Kd, which gives the ratio of the concentration in the solid phase to that in the solution phase. The K d value of a metal reflects the net effect of various reactions in the solid and liquid phases and varies by orders of magnitude among soils. The Kd value can be derived from the solid-liquid distribution of added metal or that of the soil-borne metal. Only part of the solid-phase metal is rapidly exchangeable with the solution phase. Various methods have been developed to quantify this 'labile' phase, and Kd values based on this phase often correlate better with soil properties than Kd values based on total concentration, and are more appropriate to express metal ion buffering in solute transport models. The in situ soil solution is the preferred solution phase for Kddeterminations. Alternatively, water or dilute-salt extracts can be used, but these may underestimate in situ concentrations of dissolved metals because of dilution of metal-complexing ligands such as dissolved organic matter. Multi-surface models and empirical models have been proposed to predict metal partitioning from soil properties. Though soil pH is the most important soil property determining the retention of the free metal ion, Kd values based on total dissolved metal in solution may show little pH dependence for metal ions that have strong affinity for dissolved organic matter. The Kdcoefficient is used as an equilibrium constant in risk assessment models. However, slow dissociation of metal complexes in solution and slow exchange of metals between labile and non-labile pools in the solid phase may invalidate this equilibrium assumption. © 2009 British Society of Soil Science.},

abstract={Experiments were conducted to compare the affinity and reactivity of three different minerals for natural organic matter (NOM) in forest floor leachate (FFL) from hardwood and pine forests. The FFLs were acidic (pH 4) with ionic strengths of 1.4 mM (hardwood) and 1.1 mM (pine), and they contained larger organic molecules (weight average molecular weights [Mw] = 5-6 kDa) than has been reported recently for surface waters using similar methods. A synthetic diluent solution was prepared to match the inorganic chemistry of the FFL and to provide a range of initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (0-140 g C m3) for reaction with goethite (α-FeOOH), birnessite (δ-MnO2) and smectite (montmorillonite, SWy-2) in suspension, and in corresponding blanks. A variety of macroscopic and spectroscopic methods were employed to show that reaction with the three minerals resulted in distinctly different NOM adsorption, fractionation and transformation patterns. Goethite exhibited a steep initial slope in the adsorption isotherm and a maximum retention of 10.5 g C kg1. The isotherm for montmorillonite was more linear, but equal amounts of C were adsorbed to goethite and montmorillonite (per unit sorbent mass) at maximum DOC. Whereas preferential uptake of high Mw, aromatic constituents via ligand exchange was observed for goethite, compounds of lower than average Mw were retained on montmorillonite and no preference for aromatic moieties was observed. Birnessite, which has an isoelectric point of pH &lt; 2, retained low amounts of organic C (&lt;2 g C kg1) but exhibited the highest propensity for oxidative transformation of the NOM. The data indicated that fractionation behaviour of NOM is dependent on mineral surface chemistry in addition to sorbent affinity for organic C. This work also emphasizes the fact that abiotic transformation reactions must be considered in studies of NOM interaction with Fe(III) and Mn(IV) containing solid phases.

abstract={The molecular composition of water-soluble products generated by the natural degradation of charcoal particles over a period of 100 years in a temperate forest soil has been investigated by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization. The detectable products are condensed aromatic ring structures extensively substituted with oxygen-containing functional groups, indicating that oxidation and dissolution of charcoal black carbon occurs on a centennial timescale. Many of the same species are also detected within the dissolved organic matter (DOM) of the forest's soil pore waters. We introduce the calculation of carbon normalized double bond equivalents (DBE/C) as a structural determinant for the empirical formulas obtained by mass spectral analysis. A threshold DBE/C value of 0.7 serves as a criterion for identifying species with condensed aromatic ring structures (CARS). A comparison with ultrahigh resolution mass spectra from previous studies shows that many of the CARS extracted directly from soil BC have the same mass (within 1 ppm) and empirical formulas as CARS detected in volcanic ash soil humic acid (HA) from Japan, and Amazonian Rio Negro DOM. The similarity of water-soluble condensed aromatics present within, and exported from fire-impacted soils of geographically and climatically disparate ecosystems indicates that the CARS reported herein are the molecular fingerprint of black carbon degradation in soils. Understanding the production mechanisms, reactivity, and fate of these molecular species should provide new insight to BC degradation and cycling. The soil charcoal particles at this site are infiltrated by filamentous microorganisms, suggesting that saprophytic fungi may be important to soil BC degradation processes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The fate of terrestrially-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important to carbon (C) cycling in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, and recent evidence suggests that climate warming is influencing DOC dynamics in northern ecosystems. To understand what determines the fate of terrestrial DOC, it is essential to quantify the chemical nature and potential biodegradability of this DOC. We examined DOC chemical characteristics and biodegradability collected from soil pore waters and dominant vegetation species in four boreal black spruce forest sites in Alaska spanning a range of hydrologic regimes and permafrost extents (Well Drained, Moderately Well Drained, Poorly Drained, and Thermokarst Wetlands). DOC chemistry was characterized using fractionation, UV-Vis absorbance, and fluorescence measurements. Potential biodegradability was assessed by incubating the samples and measuring CO2 production over 1 month. Soil pore water DOC from all sites was dominated by hydrophobic acids and was highly aromatic, whereas the chemical composition of vegetation leachate DOC varied significantly with species. There was no seasonal variability in soil pore water DOC chemical characteristics or biodegradability; however, DOC collected from the Poorly Drained site was significantly less biodegradable than DOC from the other three sites (6% loss vs. 13-15% loss). The biodegradability of vegetation-derived DOC ranged from 10 to 90% loss, and was strongly correlated with hydrophilic DOC content. Vegetation such as Sphagnum moss and feathermosses yielded DOC that was quickly metabolized and respired. In contrast, the DOC leached from vegetation such as black spruce was moderately recalcitrant. Changes in DOC chemical characteristics that occurred during microbial metabolism of DOC were quantified using fractionation and fluorescence. The chemical characteristics and biodegradability of DOC in soil pore waters were most similar to the moderately recalcitrant vegetation leachates, and to the microbially altered DOC from all vegetation leachates. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={In this paper, we characterize the leaching of heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) from eight contaminated soils over a wide range of pH (pH 0.4-12) using an original approach based on batch pH-static leaching experiments in combination with selective chemical extractions and geochemical modeling. The leached concentrations of the heavy metals are generally much lower than the total concentrations and show a strong pH dependency, resulting in "V-shaped" leaching curves with orders of magnitude changes in solution concentrations. The "multisurface" model used incorporates adsorption to dissolved and solid organic matter (NICA-Donnan), iron/aluminum (hydr)oxide (generalized two-layer model) and clay (Donnan model). These models were applied without modifications, and only the standard set of binding constants and parameters was used (i.e., without any fitting). The model predictions of heavy metal leaching are generally adequate and sometimes excellent. Results from speciation calculations are consistent with the well-recognized importance of organic matter as the dominant reactive solid phase in soils. The observed differences between soils with respect to element speciation in the solid phase correspond to the relative amounts of the reactive surfaces present in the soils. In the solution phase, complexes with dissolved organic matter (DOM) are predominant over most of the pH range. Free metal ions (Me2+) are generally the dominant species below pH 4. The combination of the experimental and modeling approach as used in this study is shown to be promising because it leads to a more fundamental understanding of the pH-dependent leaching processes in soils. The "multisurface" modeling approach, with the selected sorption models, is shown to be able to adequately predict the leaching of heavy metals from contaminated soils over a wide range of conditions, without any fitting of parameters.},

abstract={Isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ13C(DIC)) in the Ottawa River basin is about -8 and -16‰ for lowland carbonate and upland silicate tributaries, respectively. This suggests that (1) the source of DIC to the Ottawa River is soil respiration and carbonate weathering, (2) exchange with the atmosphere is unidirectional or volumetrically unimportant, and (3) in-river respiration and photosynthesis are not significant influences on the river carbon budget. Accepting these constraints, chemical and isotopic data are used to reconstitute soil pCO2 for tributary catchments. Averages for upland silicate, mixed, and lowland carbonate basins are calculated to be roughly 2000, 5000, and 30,000 ppm, respectively. These values are used as input to model the pathway of carbon through the watershed-rain water to soil water to river water. The flux of carbon from the Ottawa River as DIC is calculated to be 4.3 X 1010 mol C/a. Utilizing carbon isotopes, 75% and 25% of the Ca2+ + Mg2+ flux is calculated to originate from carbonate and silicate weathering, respectively, and 61% of the DIC is calculated to originate from organic respiration. The latter represents some 6% of respired carbon in the basin, assuming an average respiration rate of 0.5 mmol C m-2 h-1. Based on a diffusion model, CO2 evasion to the atmosphere from the Ottawa River and its tributaries is estimated to be 1.3 X 1010 mol C/a or 30% of the DIC flux.},

abstract={Molecular level characterizations of dissolved lignin were conducted in Mississippi River plume waters to study the impact of various removal mechanisms (photooxidation, microbial degradation, and flocculation) on dissolved organic material (DOM) concentrations and compositions. Prior to analysis, dissolved (<0.2-μ pore size) samples were size fractionated by ultrafiltration into high molecular weight (HMW; >1' kDalton) and low molecular weight (LMW; <1 kDalton) components. At salinities <25 psu, flocculation and microbial degradation were the primary factors affecting lignin concentrations. At salinities >25 psu, photooxidation was a dominant factor influencing lignin compositions and concentrations. Diagnostic indicators of photooxidation include a sharp decrease in the percentage of lignin in the HMW size fraction, changes in ratios of syringyl to vanillyl phenols, and increases in LMW acid:aldehyde ratios for both vanillyl and syringyl phenols. A 10-day incubation experiment with plume water indicated rates of microbial degradation of dissolved lignin that were ∼ 30% of photooxidation rates in surface waters. These results highlight the importance of microbial as well as photochemical processes in the cycling of terrigenous DOM in coastal waters. Neither flocculation nor microbial degradation significantly altered lignin composition, suggesting that composition is primarily determined by source and photochemical transformation. Overall, high removal rates indicate the potential importance of terrigenous DOM as a carbon and nutrient source in the coastal ocean. Strong correlations between absorption coefficients at 350 nm and dissolved lignin demonstrate the potential for using absorption to trace terrigenous DOM in coastal environments with significant riverine input.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to compare soil microbial biomass and activities with the characteristics of water-extractable organic matter in different types of forest stands. The study was carried out in adjacent 70-year-old stands dominated by silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) or Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in originally similar soil on Hylocomium-Myrtillus site type in northern Finland. The birch stand was a pure single-species stand, but the coniferous stands were mixed with birch. Soil samples were taken from the humus layer. Water extracts were analyzed for the concentrations of dissolved organic C and N (DOC and DON) and characterized according to chemical composition using a resin fractionation technique and molecular size distribution. C and N in the soil microbial biomass and rates of C mineralization, net N mineralization and net nitrification were measured. Soil pH varied from 4.0 to 4.3 and was highest in the birch stand. The C-to-N ratio of the soil organic matter was higher in the pine stand than in the other stands. Per unit organic matter, the amounts of C and N in the soil microbial biomass were highest in the birch stand. In laboratory incubation experiments, both the rate of C mineralization and that of net N mineralization were much higher in soils from the birch and spruce stands than in soil from the pine stand. This was also the order for concentrations of both DOC and DON. The DOC-to-DON ratio was similar in the birch and spruce soils but higher in the pine soil. The distributions of both different chemical and molecular size fractions were relatively similar in all soils, except for differences in some fractions of DON. The hydrophobic acid fraction was the major carrier of both DOC and DON, accounting for about 60% of DOC and 40-55% of DON. The DOC-to-DON ratio was especially low in the hydrophilic neutral fraction and in the smallest molecular size fraction (< 1 kDa). Based on these results, the microbial biomass and activities appeared to be correlated with the total concentrations of DOC and DON rather than with their characteristics. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={The emerging technique of DGT (diffusive gradients in thin films) is shown to be capable of performing new speciation measurements in situ in natural waters. In DGT, metals are bound to a resin layer after passing through a well-defined diffusion layer. Cd was measured in solutions containing glycine, EDTA, and fulvic (FA) and humic acids (HA) by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV), and DGT. DGT measured similar labile fractions to ASV, with detailed differences being consistent with a thicker diffusion layer allowing more dissociation of labile complexes and a slower diffusion of FA and HA complexes through the gel. When single measurements are made in complex solutions with DGT, precise quantification is impossible due to uncertainties concerning the distribution of species with different diffusion coefficients. A new procedure was proposed based on the advantage of DGT of being able to control the pore size of the diffusive gel layer. Small (inorganic) species diffuse freely through all gels but larger FA and HA (organic) complexes diffuse less freely in more constrained gels. When measurements were made on known solutions of Cu and FA or HA, it was possible to quantify the inorganic and organic species separately. They agreed well with predictions made using the WHAM speciation code. Multiple DGT units were also deployed in situ in a stream with high dissolved organic carbon (14.6 mg/L). The systematic differences between the devices with different gel compositions enabled determination, for the first time, of the in situ concentrations of both labile inorganic and organic species in natural water. A single DGT device with a constrained gel can be used to quantify inorganic species directly, providing absolute accuracy is not required. This ability of DGT to measure well-defined fractions of metals in situ using a simple device gives it considerable potential as a regulatory tool. A direct speciation measurement may be preferable to modeling approaches which require diverse input data that are difficult to determine.},

abstract={Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is well recognized to influence the geochemistry of ecosystems. This study was conducted to determine the pathways of DOC mobilization in the forest floor of coniferous forests. DOM from the forest floor of two acid forest soils in the Fichtelgebirge (Germany) was fractionated into hydrophobic acids and neutrals, and hydrophilic acids and neutrals. Carbon distribution at both sites was similar: 53 and 52% hydrophobic acids, 23 and 22% hydrophilic acids, 10 and 11% hydrophobic neutrals, and 7 and 8% hydrophilic neutrals, respectively. Structural composition of the DOM fractions was determined using chemical degradation, FT-IR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, as well as pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry. Results indicate different chemical composition of the DOM fractions within each site. Hydrophobic acids show high concentrations of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, and a high ratio of vanillic acid to vanillin (ca 1.0), both indicating a high degree of biodegradation of plant-derived compounds. Carbohydrates are covalently bound to apolar moieties and from carbohydrate composition a lignocellulose nature of the hydrophobic acid fraction is suggested. Hydrophilic acids can be differentiated from the hydrophobic acids by their higher degree of oxidative biodegradation. The hydrophilic acid fraction also exhibits a higher ratio of microbially released polysaccharides versus plant-derived polysaccharides. Hydrophobic neutrals show the closest relationships to the refractory soil humin, with less degraded dimeric 'condensed' lignin subunits and relatively high contents of non-carbohydrate aliphatics. Hydrophilic neutrals are enriched in carbohydrates mobilized by enzymatic cellulose and hemicellulose breakdown, as well as from microbial origin. We conclude that DOM release into forest floor solution is related to microbial activity by oxidative degradation of plant-derived organic matter (e.g. water-soluble lignin and lignocellulose fragments) and by production of microbial metabolites (e.g. polysaccharides). Overall evidence suggests that hydrophobic acids (i) represent intermediates in organic matter decomposition, which can be further degraded to hydrophilic acids and CO2, and (ii) are precursors of humic substances in illuvial horizons after precipitation/adsorption. © 1994.},

abstract={During California's hot, dry summers, irrigated soils are subjected to frequent wet-dry cycles and surface layers dry to near air-dry conditions between irrigations. We investigate whether wet-dry cycles enhance soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. This research follows up on previous observations of higher DOC concentrations in the surface (0-2 cm) than deeper (2-15 cm) soil layer late in the growing season, even when soils were moist throughout the profile. We also investigate whether DOC contents correspond to other measures of C available to microorganisms. All measurements were made on soils stabilized at -0.03 MPa water potential for 48 h at 25°C to avoid the initial pulse of microbial activity which follows re-wetting of dry soils. After 3 months during the summer field season, DOC concentrations increased 2.5-fold in the surface 0-2 cm layer and 1.20 to 1.35-fold in the 2-15 cm layer in soils under both organic (N inputs of cover crop and manure) and conventional (inorganic N inputs) management for irrigated tomatoes. In microcosms exposed to wet-dry cycles for 3 months, DOC concentrations increased by 70%, while in microcosms maintained at -0.03 Mpa for 3 months DOC remained constant. The increase in DOC in both field and microcosm soils exposed to wet-dry cycles indicates that wet-dry cycles contribute to higher background DOC contents. The greater DOC increase in the field than microcosms may be due to evaporation causing upward movement of water and concentrating DOC at the soil surface, or to greater C availability in the field due to the presence of plant roots. Respiration and microbial biomass C (MBC) remained constant or declined slightly in both soil layers and microcosm treatments over the growing season, counter to the trends in DOC concentration. Therefore DOC contents measured under moist soil conditions do not appear to consistently indicate C availability to microorganisms. The percentage of labile DOC, as measured by a bioassay, declined in the surface layer of the organic field soil and in organic and conventional soils in both microcosm treatments over the 3 month experiment, possibly indicating that roots were a continuing source of labile DOC in the lower field layers. Reflecting the higher organic inputs to the organic than conventional soil, DOC, MBC and respiration rates were 2-2.5 times higher in the organic than conventional soil throughout the experiments, however the percentage of labile DOC was approximately twice as high in the conventional soil as in organic soil.},

abstract={When sewage sludge is applied to land for disposal or intended beneficial use, heavy metals accumulate in the soil. Because of the concern about the environmental danger that these sludge-borne metals could represent if mobilized, many studies have been undertaken in an attempt to clarify the different factors that contribute to metal solubility, plant uptake, and leachability. The objectives of this study were to determine if two independent factors - soluble organic chelators and preferential flow paths - enhance metal mobility through soil. Dilute solutions containing CdCl2, ZnCl2, CuCl2, and Pb(NO2)2 were applied to soil columns with a rainmaker, and leachate metals and chloride concentrations were measured. For four columns, the input metal concentrations (mg L-1) were 7.25 Cd, 4.55 Zn, 3.51 Cu, and 13.85 Pb. In four other columns, the solution also contained dissolved organic matter so that the metals were organically complexed, and input metal concentrations (mg L-1) were 6.30 Cd, 4.11 Zn, 3.19 Cu, and 12.55 Pb. For each treatment, two of the four soil columns were undisturbed and two were constructed from homogenized soils. The rate of continuous solution application was approximately 3 cm/day. The undisturbed soil columns treated with organically complexed metals had peak effluent concentrations, expressed as percent of influent, of 30, 26, 28, and 27% for Cd, Zn, Cu, and Pb, respectively. Peak effluent concentrations for undisturbed columns treated with metals in water were 30 and 23% of influent concentrations for Cd and Zn, but only 15 and 12% for Cu and Pb, respectively. However, the four homogenized soil columns retained all added metals, whether the metals were added in water or as organic complexes. The results indicate that previous laboratory metal leaching studies performed on homogenous soils might have greatly underestimated metal mobility in the field and that preferential flow, both alone and in combination with organic-facilitated transport, can accelerate metal leaching through soils.},

abstract={The conversion of the antibiotic ofloxacin and the β-blocker atenolol by means of TiO2 photocatalysis was investigated. Irradiation was provided by a UVA lamp at 3.37 × 10-6 einstein/s photon flux, while emphasis was given on the effect of catalyst type and loading (50-1500 mg/L), initial substrate concentration (5-20 mg/L), initial pH (3-10) and the effect of H2O2 (0.07-1.4 mM) as an additional oxidant on substrate conversion and mineralization in various matrices (i.e. pure water, groundwater and treated municipal effluent). Conversion was assessed measuring sample absorbance at 288 and 224 nm for ofloxacin and atenolol, respectively, while mineralization measuring the dissolved organic carbon. Degussa P25 TiO2 was found to be more active than other TiO2 samples for either substrate degradation, with ofloxacin being more reactive than atenolol. Conversion generally increased with increasing catalyst loading, decreasing initial substrate concentration and adding H2O2, while the effect of solution pH was substrate-specific. Reaction rates, following a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic expression, were maximized at a catalyst to substrate concentration ratio (w/w) of 50 and 15 for ofloxacin and atenolol, respectively, while higher ratios led to reduced efficiency. Likewise, high concentrations of H2O2 had an adverse effect on reaction, presumably due to excessive oxidant scavenging radicals and other reactive species. The ecotoxicity of ofloxacin and atenolol to freshwater species Daphnia magna was found to increase with increasing substrate concentration (1-10 mg/L) and exposure time (24-48 h), with atenolol being more toxic than ofloxacin. Photocatalytic treatment eliminated nearly completely toxicity and this was more pronounced for atenolol. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Recent evidence suggests that viruses play an influential role within the marine microbial food web. To understand this role, it is important to determine rates and mechanisms of virus removal and degradation. We used plaque assays to examine the decay of infectivity in lab-grown viruses seeded into natural seawater. The rates of loss of infectivity of native viruses from Santa Monica Bay and of nonnative viruses from the North Sea in the coastal seawater of Santa Monica Bay were determined. Viruses were seeded into fresh seawater that had been pretreated in various ways: filtration with a 0.2-μm-pore-size filter to remove organisms, heat to denature enzymes, and dissolved organic matter enrichment to reconstitute enzyme activity. Seawater samples were then incubated in full sunlight, in the dark, or under glass to allow partitioning of causative agents of virus decay. Solar radiation always resulted in increased rates of loss of virus infectivity. Virus isolates which are native to Santa Monica Bay consistently degraded more slowly in full sunlight in untreated seawater (decay ranged from 4.1 in 7.2% h-1) than nonnative marine bacteriophages which were isolated from the North Sea (decay ranged from 6.6 to 11.1% h-1). All phages demonstrated susceptibility to degradation by heat-labile substances, as heat treatment reduced the decay rates to about 0.5 to 2.0% h-1 in the dark. Filtration reduced decay rates by various amounts, averaging 20%. Heat-labile, high- molecular-weight dissolved material (&gt;30 kDa, probably enzymes) appeared responsible for about 1/5 of the maximal decay. Solar radiation was responsible for about 1/3 to 2/3 of the maximal decay of nonnative viruses and about 1/4 to 1/3 of that of the native viruses, suggesting evolutionary adaptation to local light levels. Our results suggest that sunlight is an important contributing factor to virus decay but also point to the significance of particles and dissolved substances in seawater.},

abstract={The seasonal and spatial variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and chemical composition were investigated in the Yukon River basin of Alaska, United States, and northwestern Canada. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chromophoric DOM (CDOM), and dissolved lignin phenols were measured across a range of source waters and the seasonal hydrograph. Strong relationships were determined between CDOM and both DOC and lignin phenols, highlighting the potential for deriving detailed spatial and temporal distributions of DOM composition from CDOM monitoring. Maximum concentrations of measured parameters were observed during the spring flush, when DOM had a remarkably high content of aromatic vascular plant material derived from surface soil and litter layers. A larger portion of riverine DOM was attributed to vascular plant sources than previously believed by utilizing representative vegetation leachates and a soil pore water as end-members. In combination with recent studies highlighting export of young, labile DOM during the spring flush in northern high-latitude river systems, our results suggest riverine DOM is less degraded and more labile than previously thought with clear ramifications for its biomineralization or photo-oxidation in marine environments.

abstract={The Loess Plateau in northwest China is one of the most eroded landscapes in the world, and it is urgent that alternative practices be evaluated to control soil erosion. Our objective was to determine how three different tillage practices for monoculture of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) affected soil organic carbon (SOC) and N content after 11 years. Conventional tillage with residue removal (CT), shallow tillage with residue cover (ST), and no-tillage with residue cover (NT) were investigated. Carbon and N in various aggregate-size classes and various labile organic C fractions in the 0-15- and 15-30-cm soil layers were evaluated. The ST and NT treatments had 14.2 and 13.7% higher SOC stocks and 14.1 and 3.7% higher total N (Nt) stocks than CT in the upper 15 cm, respectively. Labile C fractions: particulate organic C (POC), permanganate oxidizable C (KMnO4-C), hot-water extractable C (HWC), microbial biomass C (MBC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) were all significantly higher in NT and ST than in CT in the upper 15 cm. KMnO4-C, POC and HWC were the most sensitive fractions to tillage changes. The portion of 0.25-2 mm aggregates, mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) of aggregates from ST and NT treatments were larger than from CT at both 0-15- and 15-30-cm soil depths. The ST and NT treatments had significantly higher SOC and Nt in the 0.25-2 mm fraction at both depths and significantly higher Nt content in the upper 15 cm. Positive significant correlations were observed between SOC, labile organic C fractions, MWD, GMD, and macroaggregate (0.25-2 mm) C within the upper 15 cm. We conclude that both variants of conservation tillage (NT and ST) increase SOC stock in the rainfed farming areas of northern China and are therefore more sustainable practices than those currently being used. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence was combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to model base-extracted particulate (POM) and dissolved (DOM) organic matter quality in the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, before and after passage of Hurricane Irene in August 2011. Principle components analysis was used to determine that four of the PARAFAC components (C1-C3 and C6) were terrestrial sources to the NRE. One component (C4), prevalent in DOM of nutrient-impacted streams and estuaries and produced in phytoplankton cultures, was enriched in the POM and in surface sediment pore water DOM. One component (C5) was related to recent autochthonous production. Photoexposure of unfiltered Neuse River water caused an increase in slope ratio values (SR) which corresponded to an increase in the ratio C2:C3 for DOM, and the production of C4 fluorescence in both POM and DOM. Changes to the relative abundance of C4 in POM and DOM indicated that advection of pore water DOM from surface sediments into overlying waters could increase the autochthonous quality of DOM in shallow microtidal estuaries. Modeling POM and DOM simultaneously with PARAFAC is an informative technique that is applicable to assessments of estuarine water quality. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Cryoconite holes, which can cover 0.1-10% of the surface area of glaciers, are small, water-filled depressions (typically <1m in diameter and usually <0.5m deep) that form on the surface of glaciers when solar-heated inorganic and organic debris melts into the ice. Recent studies show that cryoconites are colonized by a diverse range of microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria and algae. Whether microbial communities on the surface of glaciers are actively influencing biogeochemical cycles or are just present in a dormant state has been a matter of debate for long time. Here, we report primary production and community respiration of cryoconite holes upon glaciers in Svalbard, Greenland and the European Alps. Microbial activity in cryoconite holes is high despite maximum temperatures seldom exceeding 0.1°C. In situ primary production and respiration in cryoconites during the summer is often comparable with that found in soils in warmer and nutrient richer regions. Considering only glacier areas outside Antarctica and a conservative average cryoconite distribution on glacial surfaces, we found that on a global basis cryoconite holes have the potential to fix as much as 64Gg of carbon per year (i.e. 98Gg of photosynthesis minus 34Gg of community respiration). Most lakes and rivers are generally considered as heterotrophic systems, but our results suggest that glaciers, which contain 75% of the freshwater of the planet, are largely autotrophic systems. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract={Headwater streams make up a large proportion of the total length and watershed area of fluvial networks, and are partially characterized by the large volume of organic matter (large wood, detritus, and dissolved organic matter) and invertebrate inputs from the riparian forest, relative to stream size. Much of those inputs are exported to downstream reaches through time where they potentially subsidize river communities. The relative rates, timing, and conversion processes that carry inputs from small streams to downstream reaches are reasonably well quantified. For example, larger particles are converted to smaller particles, which are more easily exported. Also, dissolved organic matter and surface biofilms are converted to larger particles which can be more easily intercepted by consumers. However, the quality of these materials as it affects biological activity downstream is not well known, nor is the extent to which timing permits biological use of those particles. These ecological unknowns need to be resolved. Further, land uses may disrupt and diminish material transport to downstream reaches by removing sources (e.g., forest harvest), by affecting transport and decomposition processes (e.g., flow regulation, irrigation, changes in biotic communities), and by altering mechanisms of storage within headwaters (e.g., channelization). We present conceptual models of energy and nutrient fluxes that outline small stream processes and pathways important to downstream communities, and we identify informational gaps that, if filled, could significantly advance the understanding of linkages between headwater streams and larger rivers. The models, based on empirical evidence and best professional judgment, suggest that navigable waters are significantly influenced by headwater streams through hydrological and ecological connectivities, and land use can dramatically influence these natural connectivities, impacting downstream riverine ecosystems. © 2007 American Water Resources Association.},

abstract={The lability (mobility and bioavailability) of metals varies significantly with soil properties for similar total soil metal concentrations. We studied desorption of Cu, Ni and Zn, from 15 diverse, unamended soils. These studies included evaluation of the effects of soil:solution extraction ratio and the roles of soil properties on metal desorption. Desorption was examined for each metal by computing distribution coefficients (Kd) for each metal in each soil where Kd=[M]soil/[M]solution. Results from soil:solution ratio studies demonstrated that Kd values for the metals tended to increase with increasing soil:solution ratio. This result also held true for distribution of soil organic matter (SOM). Because the soil:solution ratio has a significant effect on measured metal distributions, we selected a high soil:solution ratio to more closely approach natural soil conditions. Copper showed strong affinity to operationally defined dissolved organic matter (DOM). In this study, DOM was operationally defined based on the total organic carbon (TOC) content in 0.45-μm or 0.22-μm filtrates of the extracts. The Kd of Cu correlated linearly (r2=0.91) with the Kd of organic matter (Kd-om) where the Kd-om is equal to SOM as measured by Walkley-Black wet combustion and converted to total carbon (TC) by a factor of 0.59. These values representing solid phase TC were then divided by soluble organic carbon as measured by TOC analysis (DOM). The conversion factor of 0.59 was employed in order to construct Kd-om values based on solid phase carbon and solution phase carbon. SOM plays a significant role in the fate of Cu in soil systems. Soil-solution distribution of Ni and Zn, as well as the activity of free Cu2+, were closely related to SOM, but not to DOM. Kd values for Ni, Zn and free Cu2+ in a particular soil were divided by the SOM content in the same soil. This normalization of the Kd values for Ni, Zn, and free Cu2+ to the SOM content resulted in significant improvements in the linear relationships between non-normalized Kd values and soil pH. The semi-empirical normalized regression equations can be used to predict the solubility of Ni and Zn and the activity of free Cu2+ as a function of pH. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Mass balances of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) based on stream and precipitation inputs and outflows were measured for seven unproductive lakes in central Ontario between 1981 and 1989. Net annual CO2 evasion occurred in six of the seven study lakes with minor net invasion in the seventh. Atmospheric invasion might have been significant at certain times of the year, particularly during the growing season. Net evasion rates were greater than DIC loading rates, indicating partial mineralization of the terrestrially-derived DOC in the lakes. A steady state mass balance model adequately described the variation in DOC retention between lakes. Net annual carbon accumulation of forest communities based on estimates of net ecosystem production may be overestimated because of significant export of carbon to lakes via streams and groundwater, particularly in catchments with extensive peatlands.},

abstract={Fluxes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are an important vector for the movement of carbon (C) and nutrients both within and between ecosystems. However, although DOM fluxes from throughfall and through litterfall can be large, little is known about the fate of DOM leached from plant canopies, or from the litter layer into the soil horizon. In this study, our objectives were to determine the importance of plant-litter leachate as a vehicle for DOM movement, and to track DOM decomposition [including dissolve organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) fractions], as well as DOM chemical and isotopic dynamics, during a long-term laboratory incubation experiment using fresh leaves and litter from several ecosystem types. The water-extractable fraction of organic C was high for all five plant species, as was the biodegradable fraction; in most cases, more than 70% of the initial DOM was decomposed in the first 10 days of the experiment. The chemical composition of the DOM changed as decomposition proceeded, with humic (hydrophobic) fractions becoming relatively more abundant than nonhumic (hydrophilic) fractions over time. However, in spite of proportional changes in humic and nonhumic fractions over time, our data suggest that both fractions are readily decomposed in the absence of physicochemical reactions with soil surfaces. Our data also showed no changes in the δ13C signature of DOM during decomposition, suggesting that isotopic fractionation during DOM uptake is not a significant process. These results suggest that soil microorganisms preferentially decompose more labile organic molecules in the DOM pool, which also tend to be isotopically heavier than more recalcitrant DOM fractions. We believe that the interaction between DOM decomposition dynamics and soil sorption processes contribute to the δ13C enrichment of soil organic matter commonly observed with depth in soil profiles.},

abstract={Natural organic matter was collected from the upper Yukon River and size frationated into the &lt;1 kDa low-molecular-weight dissolved (LMW-DOC), colloidal (COC, 1 kDa to 0.45 μm) and particulate organic carbon (POC, &gt;0.45 μm) phases for characterization of elemental (C and N) and isotopic (13C, 14C and 15N) composition to examine their sources and transport. Concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) decreased from 3010 μM in mid-May to 608 μM in September, accompanying an increase in river water δ18O from the snowmelt to summer and early fall. COC was the predominant OC species, comprising, on average, 63 ± 8% of the TOC, with 23 ± 5% partitioned in the LMW-DOC and 14 ± 5% in the POC fraction. Annual riverine export flux to the ocean was 2.02 × 1012 g-C for TOC, 7.66 × 1010 g-N for total organic nitrogen (TON), and 3.53 × 1012 g-C for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), respectively. The C/N molar ratios were distinctly different between colloidal organic matter (COM, 46 ± 3) and particulate organic matter (POM, 15 ± 1.4). Similar δ13C values were found for LMW-DOM (-27.9 ± 0.5‰), COM (-27.4 ± 0.2‰), and POM (-26.2 ± 0.7‰), although there was a general increase with increasing size, suggesting a common terrigenous organic source. In contrast, distinct Δ 14C values were found for LMW-DOC (-155 to +91‰), COC (40 to 140‰), and POC (-467 to -253‰) with a decreasing trend from snowmelt to ice-open season, suggesting that turnover pathways and transport mechanisms vary with organic matter size fractions. The high abundance of COC and its contemporary 14C ages points to a predominant source from modern terrestrial primary production, likely from the leaching/decomposition of fresh plant litter in the upper soil horizon. The predominately old POC (average 3698 ± 902 years B.P.), in contrast, was largely derived from riverbank erosion and melting of permafrost. These results imply that ice-opening Yukon River flows are dominated by snowmelt (low δ18O), with high DOC (high Δ14C) but low DIC and Si(OH)4 concentrations, whereas late summer flows contain more products of permafrost or ice melt and rain (high δ 18O), with low DOC (low Δ14C) but high DIC and Si(OH)4 concentrations. A warming climate with a deeper permafrost active layer in the Yukon River watershed would enhance the mobilization and export of old terrestrial OC, but largely in the particulate form into the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean.

abstract={In this study, we examine the role of the hydroxyl (OH·) radical as a mechanism for the photodecomposition of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CD0M) in sunlit surface waters. Using γ-radiolysis of water, OH· was generated in solutions of standard humic substances in quantities comparable to those produced on time scales of days in sunlit surface waters. The second-order rate coefficients of OH· reaction with Suwannee River fulvic (SRFA; 2.7 × 104 s-1 (mg of C/L)-1) and humic acids (SRHA; 1.9 × 104 s-1 (mg of C/L)-1) are comparable to those observed for DOM in natural water samples and DOM isolates from other sources but decrease slightly with increasing OH· doses. OH· reactions with humic substances produced dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with a high efficiency of ∼0.3 mol of C02/mol of OH·. This efficiency stayed approximately constant from early phases of oxidation until complete mineralization of the DOM. Production rates of low molecular weight (LMW) acids including acetic, formic, malonic, and oxalic acids by reaction of SRFA and SRHA with OH· were measured using HPLC. Ratios of production rates of these acids to rates of DIC production for SRHA and for SRFA were similar to those observed upon photolysis of natural water samples. Bioassays indicated that OH· reactions with humic substances do not result in measurable formation of bioavailable carbon substrates other than the LMW acids. Bleaching of humic chromophores by OH· was relatively slow. Our results indicate that OH· reactions with humic substances are not likely to contribute significantly to observed rates of DOM photomineralization and LMW acid production in sunlit waters.

abstract={High-latitude northern rivers export globally significant quantities of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to the Arctic Ocean. Climate change, and its associated impacts on hydrology and potential mobilization of ancient organic matter from permafrost, is likely to modify the flux, composition, and thus biogeochemical cycling and fate of exported DOC in the Arctic. This study examined DOC concentration and the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) across the hydrograph in Siberia's Kolyma River, with a particular focus on the spring freshet period when the majority of the annual DOC load is exported. The composition of DOM within the Kolyma basin was characterized using absorbance-derived measurements (absorbance coefficient a330, specific UV absorbance (SUVA254), and spectral slope ratio S R) and fluorescence spectroscopy (fluorescence index and excitation-emission matrices (EEMs)), including parallel factor analyses of EEMs. Increased surface runoff during the spring freshet led to DOM optical properties indicative of terrestrial soil inputs with high humic-like fluorescence, SUVA254, and low SR and fluorescence index (FI). Under-ice waters, in contrast, displayed opposing trends in optical properties representing less aromatic, lower molecular weight DOM. We demonstrate that substantial losses of DOC can occur via biological (∼30% over 28days) and photochemical pathways (>29% over 14days), particularly in samples collected during the spring freshet. The emerging view is therefore that of a more dynamic and labile carbon pool than previously thought, where DOM composition plays a fundamental role in controlling the fate and removal of DOC at a pan-Arctic scale.

abstract={Changes of water table position influence carbon cycling in peatlands, but effects on the sources and sinks of carbon are difficult to isolate and quantify in field investigations due to seasonal dynamics and covariance of variables. We thus investigated carbon fluxes and dissolved carbon production in peatland mesocosms from two acidic and oligotrophic peatlands under steady state conditions at two different water table positions. Exchange rates and CO2, CH4 and DOC production rates were simultaneously determined in the peat from diffusive-advective mass-balances of dissolved CO2, CH4 and DOC in the pore water. Incubation experiments were used to quantify potential CO2 CH4, and DOC production rates. The carbon turnover in the saturated peat was dominated by the production of DOC (10-15 mmol m-2 d-1) with lower rates of DIC (6.1-8.5 mmol m-2 d-1) and CH4 (2.2-4.2 mmol m-2 d-1) production. All production rates strongly decreased with depth indicating the importance of fresh plant tissue for dissolved C release. A lower water table decreased area based rates of photosynthesis (24-42%), CH4 production (factor 2.5-3.5) and emission, increased rates of soil respiration and microbial biomass C, and did not change DOC release. Due to the changes in process rates the C net balance of the mesocosms shifted by 36 mmol m-2 d-1. According to our estimates the change in C mineralization contributed most to this change. Anaerobic rates of CO2 production rates deeper in the peat increased significantly by a factor of 2-3.5 (DOC), 2.9-3.9 (CO2), and 3-14 (CH4) when the water table was lowered by 30 cm. This phenomenon might have been caused by easing an inhibiting effect by the accumulation of CO2 and CH4 when the water table was at the moss surface.},

abstract={The potential of effluent DOM to undergo microbial degradation was assessed in batch experiments. Effluent samples from Haifa wastewater treatment plant and Qishon reservoir (Greater Haifa wastewater reclamation complex, Israel) were incubated either with effluent or soil microorganisms for a period of 2-4 months and were characterized by dissolved organic carbon contents (DOC), UV254 absorbance and by fluorescence excitation-emission matrices. Three main fluorescence peaks were identified that can be attributed to humic/fulvic components and "protein-like" structures. During biodegradation, specific fluorescences (F/DOC) of the three peaks were increased at various extents, suggesting selective degradation of non-fluorescing constituents. In some cases increase in the effluent fluorescence (F) was observed thus proposing (i) the formation of new fluorescing material associated with DOM biodegradation and/or (ii) degradation of certain organic components capable of quenching DOM fluorescence. Based on the ratio between fluorescence intensity and UV254, different biodegradation dynamics for fluorescent DOM constituents as compared with other UV-absorbing molecules was delineated. Overall, about 50% of the total DOM was found to be readily degradable such that residual resistant DOC levels were between 8 and 10 mg l-1. Enhanced levels of residual DOM in effluent-irrigated soils may contribute to the DOM pool capable of carrying pollutants to groundwater. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The effects of photochemical transformations on the bioavailability of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated in surface and deep water from the Gulf of Mexico. Seawater samples were collected from eight depths (15-1,000 m), passed through 0.2-μm pore-size filters, and exposed to sunlight in quartz bottles in a flowing seawater deck incubator for 5-9 h. Following sunlight exposure, samples were inoculated (1:10) with unfiltered seawater from 15m depth, and bacterial growth rates were estimated from rates of 3H-leucine incorporation in dark incubations. Exposure of surface-water DOM to sunlight resulted in a 75% reduction in bacterial production, whereas exposure of deep-water DOM resulted in a 40% enhancement in bacterial production. Photomineralization of bioreactive DOM likely contributed to the reduction of bacterial growth in surface water, but the photoproduction of biorefractory DOM also appeared to contribute to reduced bacterial growth. Enhanced bacterial growth in irradiated deep water was consistent with previous studies demonstrating the photoproduction of bioavailable substrates from deep-water DOM. Phototransformations of DOM appeared to be multifaceted and to play a critical role in the cycling of DOM in the ocean.},

abstract={Laser flash photolysis was used to investigate the transients formed on absorption of 355-nm light by dissolved organic matter (DOM) from natural water bodies and from soil. Absorption spectra and quenching studies of the transients provided confirming evidence that hydrated electrons were formed by all of the DOM that were studied. The DOM from the Suwannee River in Georgia and from the Greifensee, a Swiss lake, exhibited great variability in light-absorbing properties. Despite this high variability in absorption coefficients, the primary quantum yields for electron ejection from the Greifensee and Suwannee DOM fell in a narrow range (0.005-0.008). Steady-state irradiations (355 nm) of the DOM with 2-chloroethanol (0.02 M) present as an electron scavenger produced chloride ions with quantum yields that were about 2 orders of magnitude lower than the primary quantum yields. This result indicates that most of the photoejected electrons recombine with cations before escaping into bulk solution. Irradiations of DOM solutions under sunlight (April, latitude 34° N) photoproduced electrons at rates falling in the range of 0.2-0.4 μmol/[(mg of DOC) h]. These results indicate that hydrated electrons can play a significant role in the environmental photoreduction of persistent, electronegative pollutants but may be relatively unimportant in the environmental production of hydrogen peroxide. © 1987, American Chemical Society.

abstract={Perfluorinated chemicals such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are environmentally persistent and recalcitrant to most conventional chemical and microbial treatment technologies. In this paper, we show that sonolysis is able to decompose PFOS and PFOA present in groundwater beneath a landfill. However, the pseudo first-order rate constant for the sonochemical degradation in the landfill groundwater is reduced by 61 and 56% relative to MilliQ water for PFOS and PFOA, respectively, primarily due to the presence of other organic constituents. In this study, we evaluate the effect of various organic compounds on the sonochemical decomposition rates of PFOS and PFOA. Organic components in environmental matrices may reduce the sonochemical degradation rates of PFOS and PFOA by competitive adsorption onto the bubble-water interface or by lowering the average interfacial temperatures during transient bubble collapse events. The effect of individual organic compounds depends on the Langmuir adsorption constant the Henry's law constant the specific heat capacity, and the overall endothermic heat of dissociation. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are identified as the primary cause of the sonochemical rate reduction for PFOS and PFOA in landfill groundwater, whereas the effect of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) is not significant. Finally, a combined process of ozonation and sonolysis is shown to substantially recover the rate loss for PFOS and PFOA in landfill groundwater. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Several pathways have been employed to systematically modify two granular activated carbons (GACs), F400 (coal-based) and Macro (wood-based), for examining adsorption of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) from natural waters. A total of 24 activated carbons with different physical and chemical characteristics was produced. The impact of carbon treatment on the DOM adsorption was examined by conducting isotherm experiments at a neutral pH using the modified carbons and a DOM isolated from the influent to Myrtle Beach drinking water treatment plant in South Carolina (USA). Adsorption of the DOM by two activated carbon fibers, with relatively uniform pore size distributions, showed that only pores with widths larger than 1 nm were accessible to the DOM macromolecules. Increases in the carbon supermicropore and mesopore volume (i.e., > 1 nm) increased the DOM uptake, if the surface chemistry was favorable. The isotherms normalized on a surface area basis showed the significance of carbon surface chemistry on the DOM uptake. At neutral pH, adsorption of negatively charged DOM molecules was favored by basic and positively charged surfaces, while the DOM uptake was minimized when the surface had acidic characteristics. High temperature ammonia treatment of oxidized carbons considerably enhanced the DOM uptake, mainly due to the increase in accessible surface area and surface basicity. Iron-impregnated carbons indicated an enhanced affinity of iron-laden carbon surface toward the DOM species, if the surface was not negatively charged. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from forested catchments is governed by competing processes of production, decomposition, sorption and flushing. To examine the sources of DOC, carbon isotopes (14C and13C) were analyzed in DOC from surface waters, groundwaters and soils in a small forested catchment on the Canadian Shield in central Ontario. A significant fraction (greater than 50%) of DOC in major inflows to the lake is composed of carbon incorporated into organic matter, solubilized and flushed into the stream within the last 40 years. In contrast,14C in groundwater DOC was old indicating extensive recycling of forest floor derived organic carbon in the soil column before elution to groundwater in the lower B and C soil horizons. A small upland basin had a wide range in14C from old groundwater values at baseflow under dry basin conditions to relatively modern values during high flow or wetter antecedent conditions. Wetlands export mainly recently fixed carbon with little seasonal range. DOC in streams entering the small lake may be composed of two pools; an older recalcitrant pool delivered by groundwater and a young labile pool derived from recent organic matter. The relative proportion of these two pools changes seasonally due the changes in the water flowpaths and organic carbon dynamics. Although changes in local climate (temperature and/or precipitation) may alter the relative proportions of the old and young pools, the older pool is likely to be more refractory to sedimentation and decomposition in the lake setting. Delivery of older pool DOC from the catchment and susceptibility of this older pool to photochemical decomposition may consequently be important in governing the minimum DOC concentration limit in lakes.},

abstract={Soil organic carbon (SOC) and its labile fractions are strong determinants of chemical, physical, and biological properties, and soil quality. Thus, a 15-year experiment was established to assess how diverse soil fertility management treatments for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system affect SOC and total N (TN) concentrations in the North China Plain. The field experiment included three treatments: (1) unfertilized control (CK); (2) inorganic fertilizers (INF); and (3) farmyard manure (FYM). Concentrations of SOC, TN, and different labile SOC fractions were evaluated to 1-m depth. In comparison with INF and CK, FYM significantly increased SOC and TN concentrations in the 0-30 cm depth, and also those of dissolved organic C (DOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), hot-water extractable C (HWC), permanganate oxidizable C (KMnO 4-C), and particulate organic C (POC) in the 0-20 cm depth. Despite the higher crop yields over CK, application of INF neither increased the SOC nor the labile C fractions, suggesting that by itself INF is not a significant factor affecting SOC sequestration. Yet, POC (18.0-45.8% of SOC) and HWC (2.0-2.8%) were the most sensitive fractions affected by applications of FYM. Significantly positive correlations were observed between SOC and labile organic C fractions in the 0-20 cm depth. The data support the conclusion that, wherever feasible and practical, application of FYM is important to soil C sequestration and improving soil quality under a wheat/maize system in the North China Plain. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Organic matter dissolved in the percolation water of forest soils contributes largely to element cycling and transport of natural and anthropogenic compounds. The way and extent to which these processes are affected depends on the amount and the chemical composition of soluble organic matter. Because the amount of soluble organic matter varies seasonally with changes in the microbial activity in soil, it seems reasonable to assume that there may be also seasonal changes in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter. We examined dissolved organic matter in the seepage waters of organic forest floor layers over a 27-month period (1997-1999) in two forest ecosystems, a 160-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand and a 90-year-old European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest. The forest floor leachates were analysed for bulk dissolved organic C, C in hydrophilic and hydrophobic dissolved organic matter fractions, lignin-derived phenols (CuO oxidation), hydrolysable neutral carbohydrates and uronic acids, hydrolysable amino sugars, and stable carbon isotope composition. In addition, we studied the samples by use of liquid-state 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. For both investigated forest sites we found that the dissolved organic carbon concentrations in forest floor leachates were largest during summer. They peaked after rain storms following short dry periods (106-145 mg dissolved organic C 1-1). The proportions of C in the hydrophilic fractions were largest in winter and spring whereas in summer and autumn more C was found in the hydrophobic fraction. According to liquid-state 13C-NMR spectroscopy, summer and autumn samples had larger abundances of aromatic and aliphatic structures as well as larger proportions of carboxyl groups whereas the winter and spring samples were dominated by resonances indicating carbohydrates. Wet-chemical analyses confirmed these results. Winter and spring samples were rich in neutral carbohydrates and amino sugars. The summer and autumn samples contained more lignin-derived phenols which were also stronger oxidised than those in the winter and spring samples. Seasonal changes of δ13C values were found to reflect the changes in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter. Most negative values occurred when isotopically light lignin-derived compounds were abundant and less negative values when carbohydrates predominated. The different vegetation, age of the stands, and underlying mineral soils resulted in different concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and in differences in the distribution between hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic carbon. Despite of this, the results suggest that the trends in temporal variations in the composition of dissolved organic matter in forest floor seepage water were remarkably similar for both sites. Dissolved organic matter in winter and spring seems to be mainly controlled by leaching of fresh disrupted biomass debris with a large contribution of bacterial and fungal-derived carbohydrates and amino sugars. Dissolved organic matter leached from the forest floor in summer and autumn is controlled by the decomposition processes in the forest floor resulting in the production of strongly oxidised, water-soluble aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The chemical composition of dissolved organic matter in forest floor seepage water in winter and spring indicates larger mobility, larger biodegradability, and less interaction with metals and organic pollutants than that released during summer and autumn. Thus, the impact of dissolved organic matter on transport processes may vary throughout the year due to changes in its composition.},

abstract={Batch equilibrations were performed to investigate the ability of hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH) to chemically immobilize U in two contaminated sediment samples having different organic carbon contents (123 and 49 g kg-1, respectively). Apatite additions lowered aqueous U to near proposed drinking water standards in batch equilibrations of two distinct sediment strata having total U concentrations of 1703 and 2100 mg kg-1, respectively. Apatite addition of 50 g kg-1 reduced the solubility of U to values less than would be expected if autunite (Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2·10H2O) was the controlling solid phase. A comparison of the two sediment types suggests that aqueous phase U may be controlled by both the DOC content through complexation and the equilibrium pH for a given apatite application rate. Sequential chemical extractions demonstrated that apatite amendment transfers U from more chemically labile fractions, including water-soluble, exchangeable, and acid-soluble (pH ≃ 2.55) fractions, to the Mn-occluded fraction (pH ≃ 1.26). This suggests that apatite amendment redirects solid- phase speciation with secondary U phosphates being solubilized due to the lower pH of the Mn-occluded extractant, despite the lack of significant quantities of Mn oxides within these sediments. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis conducted in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) confirmed that apatite amendment sequesters some U in secondary Al/Fe phosphate phases.},

abstract={Trace elements are added to poultry feed for disease prevention and enhanced feed efficiency. High concentrations are found in poultry litter (PL), which raises concerns regarding trace element loading of soils. Trace metal cation solubility from PL may be enhanced by complexation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Mineralization of organo-As compounds may result in more toxic species such as As(III) and As(V). Speciation of these elements in PL leachates should assist in predicting their fate in soil. Elemental concentrations of 40 PL samples from the southeastern USA were determined. Watersoluble extractions (WSE) were fractionated into hydrophobic, anionic, and cationic species with solid-phase extraction columns. Arsenic speciation of seven As species, including the main As poultry feed additives, roxarsone (ROX; 3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylarsonic acid) and p-arsanilic acid (p-ASA; 4-aminophenylarsonic acid), was performed by ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (IC-ICP-MS). Total As concentrations in the litter varied from 1 to 39 mg kg-1, averaging 16 mg kg-1. Mean total Cu, Ni, and Zn concentrations were 479, 11, and 373 mg kg-1, respectively. Copper and Ni were relatively soluble (49 and 41% respectively) while only 6% of Zn was soluble. Arsenic was highly soluble with an average of 71% WSE. Roxarsone was the major As species in 50% of PL samples. However, the presence of As(V) as the major species in 50% of the PL samples indicates that mineralization of ROX had occurred. The high solubility of As from litter and its apparent ready mineralization to inorganic forms coupled with the large quantity of litter that is annually land-applied in the USA suggests a potential detrimental effect on soil and water quality in the long term.},

abstract={Highly resolved time series data are useful to accurately identify the timing, rate, and magnitude of solute transport in streams during hydrologically dynamic periods such as snowmelt. We used in situ optical sensors for nitrate (NO 3 -) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter fluorescence (FDOM) to measure surface water concentrations at 30 min intervals over the snowmelt period (March 21-May 13, 2009) at a 40.5 hectare forested watershed at Sleepers River, Vermont. We also collected discrete samples for laboratory absorbance and fluorescence as well as δ 18O-NO 3 - isotopes to help interpret the drivers of variable NO 3 - and FDOM concentrations measured in situ. In situ data revealed seasonal, event and diurnal patterns associated with hydrological and biogeochemical processes regulating stream NO 3 - and FDOM concentrations. An observed decrease in NO 3 - concentrations after peak snowmelt runoff and muted response to spring rainfall was consistent with the flushing of a limited supply of NO 3 - (mainly from nitrification) from source areas in surficial soils. Stream FDOM concentrations were coupled with flow throughout the study period, suggesting a strong hydrologic control on DOM concentrations in the stream. However, higher FDOM concentrations per unit streamflow after snowmelt likely reflected a greater hydraulic connectivity of the stream to leachable DOM sources in upland soils. We also observed diurnal NO 3 - variability of 1-2 μmol l -1 after snowpack ablation, presumably due to in-stream uptake prior to leafout. A comparison of NO 3 - and dissolved organic carbon yields (DOC, measured by FDOM proxy) calculated from weekly discrete samples and in situ data sub-sampled daily resulted in small to moderate differences over the entire study period (-4 to 1% for NO 3 - and -3 to -14% for DOC), but resulted in much larger differences for daily yields (-66 to +27% for NO 3 - and -88 to +47% for DOC, respectively). Despite challenges inherent in in situ sensor deployments in harsh seasonal conditions, these data provide important insights into processes controlling NO 3 - and FDOM in streams, and will be critical for evaluating the effects of climate change on snowmelt delivery to downstream ecosystems. © 2011 US Government.},

abstract={We investigated how pH and temperature influenced fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2 and bacterial activity in a laboratory experiment with upper (F) and lower (H) mor humus layers from a limed and an unlimed plot of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). Dolomite lime (8.8 t ha-1) was applied 12 years before the experiment. The microbial activity was manipulated by incubating the mor humus at +4 or + 15°C. In a second experiment, the bacterial decomposition of DOC in leachate water from the entire O horizon of the same limed and unlimed plots was investigated. The cumulative amount of respired C from the F and H layers increased in the order unlimed + 4°C &lt; unlimed + 15°C = limed + 4°C &lt; limed + 15°C. The cumulative leaching of DOC from the F layer was in the order unlimed + 4°C &lt; unlimed + 15°C &lt; limed + 4°C &lt; limed + 15°C. Both liming and temperature influenced the leaching of DOC. In the H layer the cumulative DOC leaching increased in the order unlimed + 4°C &lt; limed + 4°C &lt; unlimed + 15°C = limed + 15°C and temperature was the main factor controlling the DOC leaching. The bacterial activity in the limed leachate water (measured as incorporation of 3H labelled thymidine) was higher than in the unlimed leachate water from both F and H layers. This increase in bacterial activity in the limed mor humus was proportionally higher than the corresponding increase in CO2 respiration, which indicated that the bacteria in the soil water were more stimulated by liming than bacteria attached to soil particles and fungi. Chemical fractionation indicated that DOC from the limed treatment was more decomposed than DOC from the unlimed treatment, as the percentage of hydrophilic acids compared to hydrophobic acids was higher in the limed treatment. However, this difference seemed to be of less importance for the substrate availability to the bacteria in the water phase. Instead the bacterial community in the limed mor humus seemed to be more adapted to high pH and had a higher growth rate than the bacterial community in the unlimed humus. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

One-third lower soil respiration rates at the no-litter plot gave evidence that the forest floor was the source of considerable amounts of microbially degradable C. Laboratory incubation of C-extr, fractionated into neutral and acid moieties, showed that part of the C-extr was degraded rapidly, and that the high-molecular-weight acid fraction was much less degradable than the neutral C. To the extent that the degradable portion of the water-extractable C can be regenerated quickly, it may supply much of the substrate for heterotrophic soil respiration.},

abstract={The effects of compaction on soil porosity and soil water relations are likely to influence substrate availability and microbial activity under fluctuating soil moisture conditions. We conducted a short laboratory incubation to investigate the effects of soil compaction on substrate availability and biogenic gas (CO2 and N2O) production during the drying and rewetting of a fine-loamy soil. Prior to initiating the drying and wetting treatments, CO2 production (-10 kPa soil water content) from uncompacted soil was 2.3 times that of compacted soil and corresponded with higher concentrations of microbial biomass C (MBC) and dissolved organic C (DOC). In contrast, N2O production was 67 times higher in compacted than uncompacted soil at field capacity. Soil aeration rather than substrate availability (e.g. NO3- and DOC) appeared to be the most important factor affecting N2O production during this phase. The drying of compacted soil resulted in an initial increase in CO2 production and a nearly two-fold higher average rate of C mineralization at maximum dryness (owing to a higher water-filled pore space [WFPS]) compared to uncompacted soil. During the drying phase, N2O production was markedly reduced (by 93-96%) in both soils, though total N2O production remained slightly higher in compacted than uncompacted soil. The increase in CO2 production during the first 24 h following rewetting of dry soil was about 2.5 times higher in uncompacted soil and corresponded with a much greater release of DOC than in compacted soil. MBC appeared to be the source of the DOC released from uncompacted soil but not from compacted soil. The production of N2O during the first 24 h following rewetting of dry soil was nearly 20 times higher in compacted than uncompacted soil. Our results suggest that N2O production from compacted soil was primarily the result of denitrification, which was limited by substrates (especially NO3-) made available during drying and rewetting and occurred rapidly after the onset of anoxic conditions during the rewetting phase. In contrast, N2O production from uncompacted soil appeared to be primarily the product of nitrification that was largely associated with an accumulation of NO3- following rewetting of dry soil. Irrespective of compaction, the response to drying and rewetting was greater for N2O production than for CO2 production. Crown Copyright © 2009.},

abstract={The role of rhizosphere processes in metal hyperaccumulation is largely unexplored and a matter of debate, related field data are virtually not available. We conducted a field survey of rhizosphere characteristics beneath the Ni hyperaccumulator Thlaspi goesingense Hálácsy and the metal-excluder species Silene vulgaris L. and Rumex acetosella L. growing natively on the same serpentine site. Relative to bulk soil and to the rhizosphere of the excluder species, we found significantly increased DOC and Ni concentrations in water extracts of T. goesingense rhizosphere, whereas exchangeable Ni was depleted due to excessive uptake of Ni. Chemical speciation analysis using the MINTEQA2 software package revealed that enhanced Ni solubility in Thlaspi rhizosphere is driven by the formation of Ni-organic complexes. Moreover, ligand-induced dissolution of Ni-bearing minerals is likely to contribute to enhanced Ni solubility. Increased Mg and Ca concentrations and pH in Thlaspi rhizosphere are consistent with ligand-induced dissolution of orthosilicates such as forsterite (Mg2SiO4). Our field data reinforce the hypothesis that exudation of organic ligands may contribute to enhanced solubility and replenishment of metals in the rhizosphere of hyperaccumulating species. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={The composition and biodegradability of streamwater dissolved organic matter (DOM) varies with source material and degree of transformation. We combined PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate seasonal changes in the lability of DOM along a soil-stream continuum in three soil types: bog, forested wetland and upland forest. The percent BDOC ranged from 7 to 38% across all sites, and was significantly greater in soil compared to streamwater in the bog and forested wetland, but not in the upland forest. The percent BDOC also varied significantly over the entire sampling period in soil and streamwater for the bog and forested wetland, as BDOC peaked during the spring runoff and was lowest during the summer months. Moreover, the chemical quality of DOM in wetland soil and streamwater was similar during the spring runoff and fall wet season, as demonstrated by the similar contribution of protein-like fluorescence (sum of tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence) in soil water and in streams. These findings suggest that the tight coupling between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is responsible for the delivery of labile DOM from wetland soils to streams. The contribution of protein-like fluorescence was significantly correlated with BDOC (p < 0.001) over the entire sampling period indicating DOM is an important source of C and N for heterotrophic microbes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the production of protein-rich, labile DOM and subsequent loss in stream runoff might be an important loss of labile C and N from coastal temperate watersheds. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract={To elucidate the roles of hydrology and vegetation in belowground carbon cycling within peatlands, radiocarbon values were obtained for pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CH4, and peat from the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatland. The major implication of this work is that the rate of microbial respiration within a peat column is greater than the peat decomposition rate. The radiocarbon content of DOC at both bog and fen was enriched relative to solid-phase peat by ∼ 150-300‰ consistent with the advection of recently photosynthesized DOC downward into the peat column. Fen Δ14C values for DIC and CH4 closely track the Δ14C of pore water DOC at depth, indicating that this recent plant production was the predominant substrate for microbial respiration. Aceticlastic methanogenesis apparently dominated the upper third of the peat column (α = 1.05), shifting toward CO2 reduction with depth (1.05 &lt; α &lt; 1.08). Upwelling groundwater contributed as much as 15% of the DIC to the bulk DIC pool at depth in the fen. The similarity of Δ14C values for DIC and CH4 suggests that methanogens utilized DIC from this source as well as DIC produced in situ. Bog Δ14C values for pore water DIC and CH4 differ by ≤ 15‰ at all depths and are depleted in 14C relative to DOC by ∼ 100‰, suggesting microbial utilization of a mixture of older and modern substrates. CO2 reduction was the primary pathway for methanogenesis at all depths in the bog (α = 1.08), and groundwater influence on bulk DIC was negligible. For both sites, Δ14C-DIC and Δ14C-CH4 are approximately equal at depths where stable isotope data indicate a predominance of CO2 reduction and dissimilar when acetate fermentation is indicated.},

abstract={The chemical relationships among particulate and colloidal organic material and dissolved fulvic acid were examined in an alpine and subalpine lake and two streams in Loch Vale Watershed, Rocky Mountain National Park. The alpine lake, Sky Pond, had the lowest dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (0.37 mgC/L), the highest particulate carbon (POC) (0.13 mgC/L), and high algal biomass. The watershed of Sky Pond is primarily talus slope, and DOC and POC may be autochthonous. Both Andrews Creek and Icy Brook gain DOC as they flow through wet sedge meadows. The subalpine lake, The Loch, receives additional organic material from the surrounding forest and had a higher DOC (0.66 mgC/L). Elemental analysis, stable carbon isotopic compositon, and 13C-NMR characterization showed that: 1) particulate material had relatively high inorganic contents and was heterogeneous in compositon, 2) colloidal material was primarily carbohydrate material with a low inorganic content at all sites; and 3) dissolved fulvic acid varied in compositon among sites. The low concentration and carbohydrate-rich character of the colloidal material suggests that this fraction is labile to microbial degradation and may be turning over more rapidly than particulate fractions or dissolved fulvic acid. Fulvic acid from Andrews Creek had the lowest N content and aromaticity, whereas Sky Pond fulvic acid had a higher N content and lower aromaticity than fulvic acid from The Loch. The UV-visible spectra of the fulvic acids demonstrate that variation in characteristics with sources of organic carbon can explain to some extent the observed nonlinear relationship between UV-B extinction coefficients and DOC concentrations in lakes.},

abstract={This report assesses research on the interactions of UV radiation (280–400 nm) and global climate change with global biogeochemical cycles at the Earth’s surface. The effects of UV-B (280–315 nm), which are dependent on the stratospheric ozone layer, on biogeochemical cycles are often linked to concurrent exposure to UV-A radiation (315–400 nm), which is influenced by global climate change. These interactions involving UV radiation (the combination of UV-B and UV-A) are central to the prediction and evaluation of future Earth environmental conditions. There is increasing evidence that elevated UV-B radiation has significant effects on the terrestrial biosphere with implications for the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and other elements. The cycling of carbon and inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen can be affected by UV-B-mediated changes in communities of soil organisms, probably due to the effects of UV-B radiation on plant root exudation and/or the chemistry of dead plant material falling to the soil. In arid environments direct photodegradation can play a major role in the decay of plant litter, and UV-B radiation is responsible for a significant part of this photodegradation. UV-B radiation strongly influences aquatic carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and metals cycling that affect a wide range of life processes. UV-B radiation changes the biological availability of dissolved organic matter to microorganisms, and accelerates its transformation into dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen, including carbon dioxide and ammonium. The coloured part of dissolved organic matter (CDOM) controls the penetration of UV radiation into water bodies, but CDOM is also photodegraded by solar UV radiation. Changes in CDOM influence the penetration of UV radiation into water bodies with major consequences for aquatic biogeochemical processes. Changes in aquatic primary productivity and decomposition due to climate-related changes in circulation and nutrient supply occur concurrently with exposure to increased UV-B radiation, and have synergistic effects on the penetration of light into aquatic ecosystems. Future changes in climate will enhance stratification of lakes and the ocean, which will intensify photodegradation of CDOM by UV radiation. The resultant increase in the transparency of water bodies may increase UV-B effects on aquatic biogeochemistry in the surface layer. Changing solar UV radiation and climate also interact to influence exchanges of trace gases, such as halocarbons (e.g., methyl bromide) which influence ozone depletion, and sulfur gases (e.g., dimethylsulfide) that oxidize to produce sulfate aerosols that cool the marine atmosphere. UV radiation affects the biological availability of iron, copper and other trace metals in aquatic environments thus potentially affecting metal toxicity and the growth of phytoplankton and other microorganisms that are involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Future changes in ecosystem distribution due to alterations in the physical and chemical climate interact with ozone-modulated changes in UV-B radiation. These interactions between the effects of climate change and UV-B radiation on biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial and aquatic systems may partially offset the beneficial effects of an ozone recovery. © 2007 The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.},

Surface and subsurface peat soils were incubated for 60 d under a range of temperature (10, 20, and 30°C) and soil water contents (0.3-10.0 g-water g-soil -1). Both CO2-C and DOC were monitored during the incubation period. Results showed that significant amount of DOC was produced only in the surface soil under constantly flooded conditions or flooding/non-flooding cycles. The DOC production was independent of temperature and soil water content under non-flooded condition, although CO2 evolution was highly correlated with these parameters. Aromatic carbon and hydrophobic acid contents in surface DOC were increased with wetter incubation treatments. In addition, positive linear correlations (r2=0.87) between CO2-C mineralization rate and DOC concentration were observed in the surface soil, but negative linear correlations (r2=0.70) were observed in the subsurface soil. Results imply that mineralization of soil organic carbon by microbes prevailed in the subsurface soil. A conceptual model using a kinetic approach is proposed to describe the relationships between CO2-C mineralization rate and DOC concentration in these soils. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Biotic transformation of inorganic mercury, Hg(II), to mono methyl mercury (MeHg) is proposed to be largely controlled by passive uptake of neutral Hg complexes by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). In this study, the chemical speciation of Hg(II) in seven locally contaminated sediments covering environments such as (i) brackish water, (ii) low-productivity freshwater, and, (iii) high-productivity freshwater was related to potential Hg methylation rates, determined by incubation at 23°C for 48 h under N2(g), and to total MeHg concentrations in sediments. Pore water speciation was modeled considering Hg complexes with halides, organic thiols [Hg(SR)2(aq), associated to dissolved organic matter], monosulfides, and bisulfides. The sum of neutral mercury sulfides [Hg(SH)20(aq)] and [HgS 0(aq)] was significantly, positively (p &lt; 0.001, n = 20) correlated to the specific methylation rate constant (Km, day -1) at depths of 5-100 cm in two brackish water sediments. Total Hg, total mercury sulfides or Hg(SR)2(aq) in pore water gave no significant relationships with Km. In two subsets of freshwater sediments, neutral mercury sulfides were positively correlated to total Hg in pore water, and therefore, total Hg also gave significant relationships with Km. The sum of [Hg(SH)20(aq)] and [HgS 0(aq)] was significantly, positively correlated to total sediment MeHg (μg kg-1) in brackish waters (p &lt; 0.001, n = 23), in southern, high-productivity freshwaters (p &lt; 0.001, n = 20), as well as in northern, low-productivity freshwater (p = 0.048, n = 6). The slopes (b, b′) of the relationships Km (day-1) = a + b([Hg(SH)20(aq)] + [HgS0(aq)]) and MeHg (μg kg-1) = a′ + b′([Hg(SH)20(aq)] + [HgS0(aq)]) showed an inverse relationship with the C/N ratio, supposedly reflecting differences in primary production and energy-rich organic matter availability among sites. We conclude that concentrations of neutral inorganic mercury sulfide species, together with the availability of energy-rich organic matter, largely control Hg methylation rates in contaminated sediments. Furthermore, Hg(SH)0(aq) is suggested to be the dominant species taken up by MeHg producing bacteria in organic-rich sediments without formation of HgS(s). © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from several sources influenced the adsorption and the desorption by soil of three herbicides: dimefuron {4-[2- chloro-4-(3,3-dimethylureido) phenyl]-2-t-butyl-1,3,4-oxadiazolin-5- one},atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropyl-amino-s-triazine), and carbetamide [D-N-ethyl-2-(phenyl-carbamoyloxy)propioamide)]. The DOM was endogenous (water soluble and humic compounds directly extracted from soil) or exogenous (water soluble organic matter from compounds applied to soils through agricultural practices: sewage sludge, fermented straw, and farmyard slurry; and two model compounds-tannic acid and an anionic surface active agent). Experiments were conducted to quantify the importance of herbicide sorption in three separate systems: DOM-soil, DOM-herbicide in solution, and DOM-adsorbed herbicide. Herbicide adsorption strongly increased in the presence of water soluble materials from fermented straw, which explained the lowest desorption obtained with this DOM. On the other hand, the water soluble extracts of liquid or solid sludge favored herbicide desorption. Generally, adsorption of the less soluble herbicides (dimefuron and atrazine) was favored when soil was pretreated with DOM, and their adsorption generally decreased when DOM was preincubated with herbicides before soil contact. Opposite effects were generally noted for the most soluble herbicide (carbetamide). A new empirical, two-compartment model provided a good description of desorption isotherms. The first compartment (a linear desorption) was similar for most DOM types. The differences in desorption isotherms were mainly related to the different behavior of the second compartment (an exponential desorption), in which the molecules were more strongly adsorbed.},

abstract={Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured in precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, and soil, peat and stream water in a 50 ha catchment with a central 5 ha swamp at Mont St. Hilaire, Quebec. DOC concentrations in precipitation were low (2.0 mg L-1), but increased in passage through the tree canopies as throughfall (9.1-14.6 mg L-1) and stemflow (23.1-30.1 mg L-1). For the period July 1-November 15, 1987, 0.5 g DOC m-2 was imported as precipitation, and forest canopies contributed a further 1.4-1.7 g m-2 2 to the soil surface. DOC concentrations were higher (46.0 and 67.6 mg L-1) in upland soil organic horizons, but decreased with depth because subsoil mineral horizons acted as a major sink of DOC. A laboratory experiment using leaf leachate revealed that subsoil horizons were able to adsorb DOC, with equilibrium DOC concentrations ranging from 3 to 19 mg L-1. Soil organic carbon appeared to be an important determinant of equilibrium DOC concentrations. The swamp was a major source of DOC, with an overall average DOC concentration of 58.6 mg L-1 and showed strong spatial and temporal variations related to hydrologic and thermal regimes. During base flow periods, stream DOC concentrations were small (&lt; 3 mg L-1), dominated by water fed from springs draining upland soils. During high flows, stream DOC concentrations increased through the contribution of DOC-rich water originating in the swamp. Sources, sinks and transport of DOC are thus a function of a complex set of inter-related biotic and abiotic process. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Chemical changes along headwater streams at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire suggest that important differences exist in biogeochemical cycles along an altitudinal gradient within small watershed ecosystems. Using data collected during the period 1982-92, we have constructed element budgets [Ca, Mg, K, Na, Si, Al, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), S, and N] for three subcatchments within watershed 6, a forested watershed last logged around 1917-20. The biogeochemistry of the high-elevation spruce-fir-white birch subcatchment was dominated by processes involving naturally occuring organic compounds. Stream water and soil solutions in this zone had elevated concentrations of organic acidity, DOC, and organically bound monomeric aluminum (Al(o)), relative to lower-elevation sites. The middle-elevation subcatchment, dominated by hardwood vegetation, had the greatest net production of inorganic-monomeric aluminum (Al(i)), and exhibited net immobilization of DOC and Al(o). The low-elevation subcatchment, also characterized by deciduous vegetation, had the highest rates of net production of base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+) among the subcatchments. Living biomass of trees declined slightly in the spruce-fir-white birch subcatchment during the study period, remained constant in the middle-elevation zone, and increased by 5% in the low-elevation subcatchment. Coupling the corresponding changes in biomass nutrient pools with the geochemical patterns, we observed up to 15-fold differences in the net production of Ca, Mg, K, Na, and Si in soils of the three subcatchments within this 13.2-ha watershed. Release of Ca, Na, and dissolved Si in the highest-elevation subcatchment could be explained by the congruent dissolution of 185 mol ha-1 y-1 of plagioclase feldspar. The rate of plagioclase weathering, based on the net output of Na, increased downslope to 189 and 435 mol ha-1 y-1 in the middle-elevation and low-elevation subcatchments, respectively. However, the dissolution of feldspar in the hardwood subcatchments could account for only 26%-37% of the observed net Ca output. The loss of Ca from soil exchange sites and organic matter is the most likely source of the unexplained net export. Furthermore, this depletion appears to be occurring most rapidly in the lower half of watershed 6. The small watersheds at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest occupy a soil catena in which soil depth and soil-water contact time increase downslope. By influencing hydrologic flowpaths and acid neutralization processes, these factors exert an important influence on biogeochemical fluxes within small watersheds, but their influence on forest vigor is less dear. Our results illustrate the sensitivity of watershed-level studies to spatial scale. However, it appears that much of the variation in element fluxes occurs in the first 10-20 ha of drainage area.},

abstract={Activities of man in rivers and their watersheds have altered enormously the timing, magnitude, and nature of inputs of materials to estuaries. Despite an awareness of large-scale, long-term changes in river-estuarine watersheds, we do not fully understand the consequences to estuarine ecosystems of these activities. Deforestation, urbanization, and agriculturalization have changed the timing and nature of material inputs to estuaries. Conversion of land from forest to almost any other land use promotes overland flow of storm runoff; increases the timing, rate and magnitude of runoff; and increases sediment, organic matter, and inorganic nutrient export. It has been estimated that total organic carbon levels in rivers have increased by a factor of 3-5 over natural levels. Man's activities have also changed the magnitude of particulate organic carbon relative to dissolved organic carbon export and the lability of the organic matter. Historically, rivers and streams had different features than they do today. Two of man's activities that have had pronounced effects on the timing and quality of river water are channelization and damming. Agricultural drainage systems, channelized and deepened streams, and leveeing and prevention of overbank flooding have had the combined effect of increasing the amplitude and rate of storm runoff, increasing sediment load, increasing nutrient delivery downstream, and decreasing riparian wetland productivity. Dams on the other hand have altered natural discharge patterns and altered the downstream transfer of sediments, organic matter, and nutrients. Patterns of estuarine community metabolism are sensitive to variations, in the timing, magnitude, and quality of material inputs from watersheds. The autotrophic-heterotrophic nature of an estuary is determined by three primary factors: the ratio of inorganic to organic matter inputs, water residence time, and the overall lability of allochthonous organic matter inputs. A simulation model is used to explore the effects of man's activities in watersheds on the spatial patterns of production and respiration in a generalized estuarine system. Examined are the effects of variations in the ratios of inorganic and organic nitrogen loading, the residence time of water in the estuary, the degradability of allochthonous organic matter, and the ratio of dissolved to particulate organic matter inputs. Simulations suggest that the autotrophic-heterotrophic balance in estuaries is more sensitive to variations in organic matter loading than inorganic nutrient loading. Water residence time and flocculation-sedimentation of organic matter are two physical factors that most effect simulated spatial patterns of metabolism in estuaries. © 1995 Estuarine Research Federation.},

abstract={Quartz is the most stable natural solid phase of silica. It weathers extremely slowly at the Earth's surface1, and often resists weathering even after all other silicate minerals have been degraded. However, there is ample evidence from both ancient and modern environments indicating enhanced dissolution and mobility of silica under conditions that cannot easily be explained by the inorganic controls of quartz solubility2. Increased solubility of quartz has been observed particularly in soils rich in organic material; however, no direct link between dissolved organic carbon and dissolved silica has been identified3. Here we present evidence for an increase in the solubility of quartz in a natural water brought about by dissolved organic compounds. These compounds were produced by the biodegradation of petroleum, and consist largely of a complex mixture of organic acids. We propose that silica is being complexed and mobilized by these organic acids in waters having close to neutral pH. © 1987 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract={Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic systems is known to reduce the bioavailability of heavy metals. Recent studies have shown similar reductions in bioavailability of organic contaminants. The mechanism for reduction, with Aldrich humics, was to reduce the freely dissolved, bioavailable, xenobiotic concentration by partitioning to DOM. This mechanism was also found to apply to organic contaminants in the presence of DOM from interstitial waters. A reverse‐phase separation technique was used to measure the sorbed xenobiotic, and by difference from the total, the freely dissolved concentration of a contaminant permitting the calculation of a partition coefficient (Krp). Equilibrium partitioning of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and poly‐chlorinated biphenyl congeners to the DOM, in interstitial waters from several geographical sources, ranged over several orders of magnitude for a single compound. The reduction in bioavailability was measured by reduction in the conditional uptake rate constant for organic xenobiotics in the presence of DOM, for the amphipod Pontoporeia hoyi (the major benthic invertebrate in the Great Lakes). Reduction in the conditional uptake rate constant versus controls was used to calculate a biologically determined partition coefficient (Kb). The log Krp was well correlated with log Kb, log Kb = 1.54(0.15) + 0.723(0.03) log Krp (r2 = 0.74, n = 195) over a range of three orders of magnitude in measured partition coefficient for individual compounds using DOM from different sources.

abstract={In the mangrove of the Caeté Estuary (North Brazil) a detailed sampling was carried out in order to gain insight into the dynamics of inorganic nutrients and organic matter in one of the world's largest mangroves and to identify the driving forces behind these processes. Throughout 36 tidal cycles in the course of one year, concentrations of dissolved and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, POC, DON, PON) and dissolved inorganic nutrients (N, P, Si compounds) were determined in a mangrove tidal creek. Annual average concentrations (in μM) were DOC 360, POC 240, DON 20, PON 29, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) 11, silicate 170 and phosphate 2.4. Ammonium and nitrite were about 80 and 17% of DIN, respectively. Nutrient dynamics in the creek were significantly influenced by porewater input from the upper forest sediment layer. This led to characteristic tidal signatures of nutrient and organic matter concentrations with maximum values during low tide. Annual phosphate and DOC oscillations were caused mainly by tidally dependent variations of porewater input. Their concentrations in the creek were directly proportional to the hydraulic gradient between creek and sediment water table. Due to autotrophic activity, dissolved oxygen, pH and DOC were higher and DIN was lower during daytime than at night. Annual oscillations of DIN and DON could also be attributed to varying phytoplanktonic activity. Silicate and phosphate showed only weak response to aquatic photosynthesis with slightly lower concentrations during the day. Assuming equilibrated fluxes, nitrogen fixation in the forest could be estimated to be 2.3 mmol N m−2 d−1. Based on these findings, tidal range and porewater concentrations were identified as driving forces behind coastal outwelling of nutrients and organic matter from mangroves. Outwelling probably occurs only from mangroves where the nutrient concentration in porewater exceeds the demands of the benthic community and trees, caused by positive sedimentation balances and high nitrogen fixation rates, and only in macrotidal regions where porewater can flow in considerable amounts to the tidal creeks and the ocean. © 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract={Peatlands are an important terrestrial carbon store. However, heightened levels of degradation in response to environmental change have resulted in an increased loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and an associated rise in the level of discolouration in catchment waters. A significant threat to peatland sustainability has been the installation of artificial drainage ditches. However, recent restoration schemes have pursued drain blocking as a possible strategy for reducing degradation, fluvial carbon loss and water discolouration. This paper investigates the effect of open cut drainage and the impact of drain blocking on DOC and colour dynamics in blanket peat soil-water solutions. Three treatments (intact peat, drained peat and drain-blocked peat) were monitored in an upland blanket peat catchment in the UK. DOC and colour values were significantly higher on the drained slopes compared with those of the intact peat, which in turn had greater DOC and colour values than the drain-blocked slopes. Consequently, drain blocking is shown to be a highly successful technique in reducing both the DOC concentration and level of discolouration in soil waters, even to values lower than those observed for the intact site, which suggests a process of store exhaustion and flushing may operate. The colour per carbon unit (C/C) ratio was significantly higher at the drain-blocked site than either the intact or the drained treatments, while the E4/E6 ratio (fulvic acid/humic acid) was significantly lower at the blocked site compared to the two other treatments. The high C/C and low E4/E6 ratios indicate that drain blocking also modifies the composition of DOC, such that darker-coloured humic substances become more dominant compared to the intact site. This implies disturbance to DOC production and/or transportation processes operating within the peat. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Northern peatlands contain enormous quantities of organic carbon within a few meters of the atmosphere and play a significant role in the planetary carbon balance. We have developed a new, process-oriented model of the contemporary carbon balance of northern peatlands, the Peatland Carbon Simulator (PCARS). Components of PCARS are (1) vascular and nonvascular plant photosynthesis and respiration, net aboveground and belowground production, and litterfall; (2) aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of peat; (3) production, oxidation, and emission of methane; and (4) dissolved organic carbon loss with drainage water. PCARS has an hourly time step and requires air and soil temperatures, incoming radiation, water table depth, and horizontal drainage as drivers. Simulations predict a complete peatland C balance for one season to several years. A 3-year simulation was conducted for Mer Bleue Bog, near Ottawa, Ontario, and results were compared with multiyear eddy covariance tower CO2 flux and ancillary measurements from the site. Seasonal patterns and the general magnitude of net ecosystem exchange of CO2 were similar for PCARS and the tower data, though PCARS was generally biased toward net ecosystem respiration (i.e., carbon loss). Gross photosynthesis rates (calculated directly in PCARS, empirically inferred from tower data) were in good accord, so the discrepancy between model and measurement was likely related to autotrophic and/or heterotrophic respiration. Modeled and measured methane emission rates were quite low. PCARS has been designed to link with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) land surface model and a global climate model (GCM) to examine climate-peatland carbon feedbacks at regional scales in future analyses.},

abstract={A combination of stable isotope studies and 14C dating were used to identify the main sources and processes controlling streamwater DOC and TIC in a temperate non-forested watershed, δ13C values for terrestrial (-24.9 to -29.1‰) and aquatic (-30.5 to -33.5‰) plants were similar to values reported in the literature for similar ecosystems. δ13C values for DOC in soil solution and streamwater were consistent with soil and terrestrial vegetation, indicating that the terrestrial ecosystem is the dominant source of aquatic DOC in this watershed. δ13C values of soil atmosphere CO2 (-17.2 to -25.2‰) were slightly less negative than would be expected for production via aerobic soil microbial decomposition and root respiration. There was a close correspondence between δ13C values (-15.5 to -21.5‰) for streamwater TIC and soil atmospheric CO2 in the central part of the catchment where the stream drains CO2-rich peats. 14C dating showed that although peat has been accumulating in the watershed for at least 2700 years, DOC in soil pore water and streamwater contains carbon of predominantly recent origin (post-AD 1955).},

abstract={Glacier-derived dissolved organic matter represents a quantitatively significant source of ancient, yet highly bioavailable carbon to downstream ecosystems 1. This finding runs counter to logical perceptions of age-reactivity relationships, in which the least reactive material withstands degradation the longest and is therefore the oldest 2. The remnants of ancient peatlands and forests overrun by glaciers have been invoked as the source of this organic matter 1,3,4. Here, we examine the radiocarbon age and chemical composition of dissolved organic matter in snow, glacier surface water, ice and glacier outflow samples from Alaska to determine the origin of the organic matter. Low levels of compounds derived from vascular plants indicate that the organic matter does not originate from forests or peatlands. Instead, we show that the organic matter on the surface of the glaciers is radiocarbon depleted, consistent with an anthropogenic aerosol source. Fluorescence spectrophotometry measurements reveal the presence of protein-like compounds of microbial or aerosol origin. In addition, ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry measurements document the presence of combustion products found in anthropogenic aerosols. Based on the presence of these compounds, we suggest that aerosols derived from fossil fuel burning are a source of pre-aged organic matter to glacier surfaces. Furthermore, we show that the molecular signature of the organic matter is conserved in snow, glacier water and outflow, suggesting that the anthropogenic carbon is exported relatively unchanged in glacier outflows. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In contrast, in shallow groundwater where dissolved iron and arsenic concentrations were high, the quinone-like moieties of humic substances were more reduced, with less abundant labileDOMthan that of surface water. Instead, DOM at these depths was characterized by terrestrial (plant/ soil) signatures. A sediment microcosm experiment demonstrated that Fe(II) and terrestrially derived DOM were released from sediment over time. The results provide new evidence to support a dual role of natural DOM in Bangladesh aquifers (1) as a labile substrate for Fe- and humic-reducing bacteria and (2) as an electron shuttle via humic substances to enhance microbial iron reduction. Fluorescence index, amino acid-like fluorescence, and redox index may serve as useful indicators of the type ofDOM likely to be involved in Fe solubilization and potentially As mobilization reactions. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Biochar (BC) can be used to remediate soils contaminated with potential toxic elements (PTEs). However, the efficiency of BC to immobilize PTEs in highly contaminated floodplain soils under dynamic redox conditions has not been studied up to date. Thus, we have (i) quantified the impact of pre-definite redox conditions on the release dynamics of dissolved aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in a highly contaminated soil (CS) (non-treated) and in the same soil treated with 10gkg-1 biochar based material (CS+BC), and (ii) assessed the efficacy of the material to reduce the concentrations of PTEs in soil solution under dynamic redox conditions using an automated biogeochemical microcosm apparatus. The impact of redox potential (EH), pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and sulfate (SO42-) on dynamics of PTEs was also determined. The EH was lowered to +68mV and afterwards increased stepwise to +535mV. Significant negative correlation between EH and pH in CS and CS+BC was detected. The systematic increase of EH along with decrease of pH favors the mobilization of PTEs in CS and CS+BC. The material addition seems to have little effect on redox processes because pattern of EH/pH and release dynamics of PTEs was basically similar in CS and CS+BC. However, concentrations of dissolved PTEs were considerably lower in CS+BC than in CS which demonstrates that BC is able to decrease concentrations of dissolved PTEs even under dynamic redox conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The removal of natural organic matter (NOM) from lake water was studied in two pilot-scale adsorbers containing granular activated carbon (GAC) with different physical properties. To study the adsorption behavior of individual NOM fractions as a function of time and adsorber depth, NOM was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) into biopolymers, humics, building blocks, and low molecular weight (LMW) organics, and NOM fractions were quantified by both ultraviolet and organic carbon detectors. High molecular weight biopolymers were not retained in the two adsorbers. In contrast, humic substances, building blocks and LMW organics were initially well and irreversibly removed, and their effluent concentrations increased gradually in the outlet of the adsorbers until a pseudo-steady state concentration was reached. Poor removal of biopolymers was likely a result of their comparatively large size that prevented access to the internal pore structure of the GACs. In both GAC adsorbers, adsorbability of the remaining NOM fractions, compared on the basis of partition coefficients, increased with decreasing molecular size, suggesting that increasingly larger portions of the internal GAC surface area could be accessed as the size of NOM decreased. Overall DOC uptake at pseudo-steady state differed between the two tested GACs (18.9 and 28.6 g-C/kg GAC), and the percent difference in DOC uptake closely matched the percent difference in the volume of pores with widths in the 1-50 nm range that was measured for the two fresh GACs. Despite the differences in NOM uptake capacity, individual NOM fractions were removed in similar proportions by the two GACs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Zero valent iron (ZVI) nanoparticles have been studied extensively for degradation of chlorinated solvents in the aqueous phase, and have been tested for in-situ remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. However, little is known about its effectiveness for degrading soil-sorbed contaminants. This work studied reductive dechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE) sorbed in two model soils (a potting soil and Smith Farm soil) using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) stabilized Fe-Pd bimetallic nanoparticles. Effects of sorption, surfactants and dissolved organic matter (DOC) were determined through batch kinetic experiments. While the nanoparticles can effectively degrade soil-sorbed TCE, the TCE degradation rate was strongly limited by desorption kinetics, especially for the potting soil which has a higher organic matter content of 8.2%. Under otherwise identical conditions, ~44% of TCE sorbed in the potting soil was degraded in 30 h, compared to ~82% for Smith Farm soil (organic matter content = 0.7%). DOC from the potting soil was found to inhibit TCE degradation. The presence of the extracted SOM at 40 ppm and 350 ppm as TOC reduced the degradation rate by 34% and 67%, respectively. Four prototype surfactants were tested for their effects on TCE desorption and degradation rates, including two anionic surfactants known as SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and SDBS (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate), a cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) bromide, and a non-ionic surfactant Tween 80. All four surfactants were observed to enhance TCE desorption at concentrations below or above the critical micelle concentration (cmc), with the anionic surfactant SDS being most effective. Based on the pseudo-first-order reaction rate law, the presence of 1×cmc SDS increased the reaction rate by a factor of 2.5 when the nanoparticles were used for degrading TCE in a water solution. SDS was effective for enhancing degradation of TCE sorbed in Smith Farm soil, the presence of SDS at sub-cmc increased TCE degraded by ~10%. However, effect of SDS on degradation of TCE in the potting soil was more complex. The presence of SDS at sub-cmc decreased TCE degradation by 5%, but increased degradation by 5% when SDS dosage was raised to 5×cmc. The opposing effects were attributed to combined effects of SDS on TCE desorption and degradation, release of soil organic matter and nanoparticle aggregation. The findings strongly suggest that effect of soil sorption on the effectiveness of Fe-Pd nanoparticles must be taken into account in process design, and soil organic content plays an important role in the overall degradation rate and in the effectiveness of surfactant uses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Effects of natural factors (drought and forest fire), and experimental perturbations (fertilization and acidification) on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and ratios to other nutrients in lakes of the Experimental Lakes Area are examined using data obtained over a period of 20 years. DOC concentration, and the ratio of dissolved iron to DOC in lakes of the area were strongly correlated with the relative size of the catchment to the lake. DOC in many lakes of the area declined over 20 years, due to increased water residence times caused by increasing average temperature and decreasing precipitation. Inexplicably, Lake 382 was an exception to this general observation. Acidification of Lake 302S to below pH 5.0 also caused DOC to decrease. The lesser acidification of Lake 223 (min. pH 5.0) did not significantly affect DOC. Experimental acidification of a small peatland also caused a temporary decline in DOC concentrations in bog pools. Changes in DOC appear to affect the availability of mercury for methylation. Addition of aluminum to a small acidic lake caused a two-fold decline in DOC. Fertilization of Lake 227 caused a considerable increase in DOC, and in ratios of DOC to other carbon fractions. New stable ratios did not occur for a decade after fertilization began. Lake 226N, fertilized at a lower rate, showed similar but less pronounced increases in DOC, but the experiment was terminated after only eight years. Phosphorus fertilization caused a dramatic increase in the lability of the DOC pool in Lake 226N, where the autochthonous carbon pool was labelled with DI14C. A large increase in autochthonous production of DOC and increased microbial utilization of allochthonous DOC appear to have occurred. DOC concentrations in streams were higher after drought, but concentrations were unrelated to flow volume during wet periods. Due to lower streamflows in drought years, annual yields of DOC from streams were unaffected by drought. Mesocosm experiments showed that DOC's primary effect on iron is to inhibit sedimentation, possibly by suppressing flocculation reactions that are known to control the cycles of many metals. The changes in DOC in lakes brought about by changes in water renewal, acidification, or other perturbations can have major effects on the cycles of metals, lake transparency, and phytoplankton production and standing crop. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={As the permafrost region warms, its large organic carbon pool will be increasingly vulnerable to decomposition, combustion, and hydrologic export. Models predict that some portion of this release will be offset by increased production of Arctic and boreal biomass; however, the lack of robust estimates of net carbon balance increases the risk of further overshooting international emissions targets. Precise empirical or model-based assessments of the critical factors driving carbon balance are unlikely in the near future, so to address this gap, we present estimates from 98 permafrost-region experts of the response of biomass, wildfire, and hydrologic carbon flux to climate change. Results suggest that contrary to model projections, total permafrost-region biomass could decrease due to water stress and disturbance, factors that are not adequately incorporated in current models. Assessments indicate that end-of-the-century organic carbon release from Arctic rivers and collapsing coastlines could increase by 75% while carbon loss via burning could increase four-fold. Experts identified water balance, shifts in vegetation community, and permafrost degradation as the key sources of uncertainty in predicting future system response. In combination with previous findings, results suggest the permafrost region will become a carbon source to the atmosphere by 2100 regardless of warming scenario but that 65%-85% of permafrost carbon release can still be avoided if human emissions are actively reduced. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The chemical interaction between soil organic matter and the orthophosphate anion (phosphate [P]) is important for reactions of P at the soil solid phase, in soil solution, and in natural waters. Humic substances account for an important or dominant part of soil organic matter and of dissolved organic carbon in rivers and lakes. Orthophosphate is not bound directly to the humic molecules, but metals complexed by the humic substances can bind P anions of which Al(III) and Fe(III) seem to be the most important.Humic-metal-P associations or complexes (HMEP) are not detected by conventional P speciation procedures in natural water and in soil solution. In addition, HMEP cannot be detected at the soil solid phase by traditional P fractionation procedures. The concentration of free orthophosphate in solution is determined spectrophotometrically by the phosphomolybdate method in its many variations, with organic P being calculated as the difference between total P and inorganic P. During the photometric procedure, more than 50%, in many cases, more than 80% of the humic-associated P, is hydrolyzed and therefore considered to be free orthophosphate. This is the main reason why HMEP are often ignored in soil chemistry. Hydrolysis occurs during the analytical speciation of P in soil solution and in soil P fractionation procedures. A step to preseparate according to the molecule mass, for example, by 5,000 to 20,000 Da ultrafiltration or by gel permeation chromatography, is therefore required.In natural water and in soil solution, HMEP can account for more than 50%, in some cases, more than 80% of the P in solution. Free orthophosphate in solution is often in equilibrium with P in HMEP.The potential relevance of HMEP at the soil solid phase can be as follows. If the content of alkaline pyrophosphate-extractable Al + Fe (after McKeague, J. A., J. E. Bryden, and N. N. Miles. 1971. Differentiation of forms of extractable iron and aluminum. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. Proc. 35:33-38) is high compared with that of acid oxalate-extractable Fe + Al (Tamm reagent, after Schwertmann, 1964), then humic-Al(Fe) complexes are important for P sorption and transformation in soil compared with oxides or clay minerals. In soils, evidence exists for the importance of HMEP in Spodosols and Andosols. Humic-P complexes are important with respect to the soil P availability to plant roots. Mobilizing plant species often excrete citrate or oxalate as a result of P deficiency. The P from HMEP is much better mobilized by dibasic and tribasic low-molecular-weight anions than P adsorbed to inorganic surfaces such as goethite or ferrihydrite.

abstract={The tropical peat swamp forests of Indonesia and Malaysia are unusual ecosystems that are rich in endemic species of flora, fauna and microbes despite their extreme acidic, anaerobic, nutrient poor conditions. They are an important refuge for many endangered species including orang utans. Ecosystem functioning is unusual: microbial decomposition is inhibited because the leaves are sclerophyllous and toxic to deter herbivory in the nutrient poor environment, yet bacteria are abundant and active in the surface layers of the peat, where they respire DOC leached from newly fallen leaves. The bacteria are subsequently consumed by aquatic invertebrates that are eaten by fish, and bacterially respired CO2 is assimilated by algae, so bacteria are thus vital to carbon and nutrient cycling. Peat swamp forests are highly sensitive to the impacts of logging, drainage and fire, due to the interdependence of the vegetation with the peat substrate, which relies on the maintenance of adequate water, canopy cover and leaf litter inputs. Even minor disturbances can increase the likelihood of fire, which is the major cause of CO2 emissions from regional peat swamp forests and which impact ecosystems worldwide by contributing to climate change. Indo-Malayan peat swamps affect the hydrology of surrounding ecosystems due to their large water storage capacity which slows the passage of floodwaters in wet seasons and maintains stream base flows during dry seasons. These forests are of global importance yet they are inadequately protected and vanishing rapidly, particularly due to agricultural conversion to oil palm, logging, drainage and annual fires. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

abstract={DyDOC describes soil carbon dynamics, with a focus on dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The model treats the soil as a three-horizon profile, and simulates metabolic carbon transformations, sorption reactions and water transport. Humic substances are partitioned into three fractions, one of which is immobile, while the other two (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) can pass into solution as DOC. DyDOC requires site-specific soil characteristics, and is driven by inputs of litter and water, and air and soil temperatures. The model operates on hourly and daily time steps, and can simulate carbon cycling over both long (hundreds-to-thousands of years) and short (daily) time scales. An important feature of DyDOC is the tracking of 14C, from its entry in litter to its loss as DO14C in drainage water, enabling information about C dynamics to be obtained from both long-term radioactive decay, and the characteristic 14C pulse caused by thermonuclear weapon testing during the 1960s ("bomb carbon"). Parameterisation is performed by assuming a current steady state. Values of a range of variables, including C pools, annual DOC fluxes, and 14C signals, are combined into objective functions for least-squares minimisation. DyDOC has been applied successfully to spruce forest sites at Birkenes (Norway) and Waldstein (Germany), and most of the parameters have similar values at the two sites. The results indicate that the supply of DOC from the surface soil horizon to percolating water depends upon the continual metabolic production of easily leached humic material. In contrast, concentrations and fluxes of DOC in the deeper soil horizons are controlled by sorption processes, involving comparatively large pools of leachable organic matter. Times to reach steady stale are calculated to be several hundred years in the organic layer, and hundreds-to-thousands of years in the deeper mineral layers. It is estimated that DOC supplies 89% of the mineral soil carbon at Birkenes, and 73% at Waldstein. The model, parameterised with "steady state" data, simulates short-term variations in DOC concentrations and fluxes, and in DO 14C, which are in approximate agreement with observations.},

abstract={Water draining from the Everglades marshes of southern Florida contains high concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC), N (DON), and in some locations, P (DOP). These dissolved organic nutrients carry over 90% of the N and organic C, and about 25% of the P exported downstream in the Everglades. Our objectives were to describe the most important aspects of the origin and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Everglades, and to describe the processes controlling its concentration and export. Concentrations of dissolved organic nutrients are influenced by local plant production, decomposition, and sorption equilibrium with peat. The drained peat soils of the Everglades Agricultural Area and the more productive marshes of the northern Everglades produce some of the highest concentrations of DOC and DON in the Everglades watershed. In portions of the marshes of the northern Everglades, P enrichment was correlated with higher local DOC and DON concentrations and greater production of soluble plant matter. Microbial degradation of Everglades DOM was very slow; less than 10% of the DOC was lost after 6 months of incubation in the laboratory and supplements of inorganic nutrients failed to speed the decomposition. Exposure to solar radiation increased the subsequent decay rate of the remaining DOC (25% in 6 mo.). Solar radiation alone mineralized 20.5% of the DOC, 7% of the DON, and degraded about 50% of the humic substances over 21 days in sterile pore-water samples and thus degraded DOM faster than microbial degradation. The humic substances appeared to inhibit biodegradation of the other fractions of the DOC since hydrophilic organic acids decomposed faster when isolated from the humic substances. The fate of DOC and DON is closely linked as indicated by a generally narrow range of C/N ratios. In contrast, high concentrations of DOP were associated with P enrichment (at least in pore water). The DOC was composed of about 50% humic substances, 33% hydrophilic acids, and 15% hydrophilic neutral substances, typical of DOC from other environments, despite the fact that it originates from a neutral to slightly alkaline peatland. Despite high exports of DON (3.9 g m-2 y-1 from one area), the marshes of the northern Everglades are a sink for DON on a landscape scale. The agricultural fields of the Everglades Agricultural Area, however, exported net quantities of DON. High concentrations of DOC desorbed from the agricultural soils when water with no DOC was added. Sorption experiments indicated that high concentrations of dissolved organic matter flowing into the marshes from the Everglades Agricultural Area could suppress the further desorption of additional soluble organic matter through physicochemical mechanisms. While biological factors, plant production and microbial decomposition are important in producing potentially soluble organic nutrients, physicochemical sorption equilibria, hydrology, and degradation by solar radiation are also likely to control the export of this material on the landscape scale.},

abstract={Amendments of biochar, a product of pyrolysis of biomass, have been shown to increase fertility of acidic soils by enhancing soil properties such as pH, cation-exchange-capacity and water-holding-capacity. These parameters are important in the context of natural organic matter contained in soils, of which dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the mobile and most bioavailable fraction. The effect of biochar on the content and composition of DOM in soils has received little research attention. This study focuses on the effects of amendments of two different biochars to an acidic acrisol and a pH-neutral brown soil. A batch experiment showed that mixing biochar with the acrisols at a 10wt.% dose increased the pH from 4.9 to 8.7, and this resulted in a 15-fold increase in the dissolved organic carbon concentration (from 4.5 to 69mgL-1). The pH-increase followed the same trend as the release of DOM in the experiment, causing higher DOM solubility and desorption of DOM from mineral sites. The binding to biochar of several well-characterised reference DOM materials was also investigated and results showed a higher sorption of aliphatic DOM to biochar than aromatic DOM, with DOM-water partitioning coefficients (Kd-values) ranging from 0.2 to 590Lkg-1. A size exclusion occurring in biochar's micropores, could result in a higher sorption of smaller aliphatic DOM molecules than larger aromatic ones. These findings indicate that biochar could increase the leaching of DOM from soil, as well as change the DOM composition towards molecules with a larger size and higher aromaticity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Long-term increases in DOC concentration in rivers draining areas of upland peat are a ubiquitous phenomenon in the UK. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these increases, but one compelling explanation is the observed long-term increase in temperature in UK uplands causing increases in peat decomposition rates, and increasing the depth of oxidation as evaporation increases depth to the water table. The study constructed an empirical model for water table depth and decomposition rate calibrated against observations from the Environmental Change Network monitoring site at Moor House in the North Pennines, UK. The study shows: (i) Depth of the water table has not changed significantly over a 30-year period, reflecting the fact that blanket peat is well buffered against climate change. (ii) Increases in temperature are responsible for a 12% increase in DOC production while an approximate 78% increase in DOC production has been observed. (iii) Overall DOC production is predicted to rise by 6% but observation suggests increases on the scale of 97%. (iv) The model inadequately represents changes in production and supply of DOC during periods of severe drought. The study shows that temperature change alone is insufficient to explain observed increases in DOC production. Alternative explanations for large increases in DOC production could include changes in land management, but an enzymic latch mechanism, i.e. derepression of anaerobic degradation, causing increased decomposition rates in response to severe drought is preferred. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Complete porewater profiles from two peat bogs in the Jura Mountains were analysed for major and trace inorganic anions and cations. At La Tourbière des Genevez (TGe) and Etang de la Gruère (EGr), peat formation began approximately 5,000 and 10,000 years BP, respectively. The maximum depths of peat accumulation are 140 cm (TGe) and 650 cm (EGr); previous geochemical studies showed that the ombrogenic sections of the bogs extend to depths of approximately 20 cm (TGe) and 250 cm (EGr). Water samples were obtained using in situ diffusion equilibrium samplers (peepers), which allow filtered (0.2 μm) porewaters to be obtained while preventing degassing and oxidation. These samplers were found to be well suited to bog porewaters and allowed volatile (dissolved CO2, acetate) and redox-sensitive species (HS-, Fe2+) to be quantified without further sample preparation or treatment. Aqueous species concentrations were determined immediately afterwards using ion chromatography with either conductivity (acetate, HCO-3, Cl-, Br-, NO-3, HPO2+4, SO2+4, Na+, NH+4, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+), amperometry (HS-), or absorbance detection (Fe(III) and Fe(II)). The comprehensive analyses of anions and cations allowed humic substances to be calculated by the difference in electrical charge balance (i.e., the anion deficit). Concentrations of total dissolved CO2 (2-12 mM) showed that carbonate equilibria play a significant role in the acid-base chemistry throughout the profiles. In near surface, ombrogenic porewaters with pH around 4, however, protons (approx. 160 μeq/L) are contributed mainly by the dissociation of humic substances (2-7 mM DOC). In the deepest, minerogenic layers H2CO3 is the predominant acid at both sites. At these depths, carbonate alkalinity (up to 3 meq/L at EGr, up to 8 meq/L at TGe) arises from reaction of the pore fluids with mineral matter in the underlying sediments. In the transition zone between the ombrogenic and minerogenic extremes, organic and inorganic acids are equal in importance. Unidentified organic S species accounted for 90-99% of total dissolved sulfur (ST) in the porewaters at TGe, with SO2+4 and HS- the dominant inorganic species; S species with intermediate oxidation states such as SO2-3 and S2O2-3 were always less than the detection limit of approximately 0.4 μM. At TGe the sulfate concentrations exceeded those of sulfide, with 1.25 and 0.25 μM, respectively, being typical. At EGr, ST and SO2-4 were comparable to the waters at TGe, but HS-at EGr was always less than the detection limit of 0.15 μM. At both sites dissimilatory sulfate reduction is limited by the low concentrations of sulfate supplied to the bog surfaces (i.e., atmospheric deposition only), and the uptake of sulfate and its conversion to organic S compounds by the living plants. Despite the anoxic condition of the waters, the ratio of Fe(III)T to Fe(II)T was always high: at EGr this ratio was generally 1:1, and even in the sulfidic waters at TGe the ratio was 1:3. PHREEQE was used to calculate the effect of complex-forming organic ligands on { Fe3+ } and { Fe2+ } in these porewaters. The relatively high ratios of Fe(III)T compared to Fe(II)T can be explained in terms of the much greater thermodynamic stability of the organic complexes of Fe3+ compared to those of Fe2+.

abstract={Northern permafrost soils store a vast reservoir of carbon, nearly twice that of the present atmosphere. Current and projected climate warming threatens widespread thaw of these frozen, organic carbon (OC)-rich soils. Upon thaw, mobilized permafrost OC in dissolved and particulate forms can enter streams and rivers, which are important processors of OC and conduits for carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate that ancient dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leached from 35,800 y B.P. permafrost soils is rapidly mineralized to CO2. During 200-h experiments in a novel high-Temporal-resolution bioreactor, DOC concentration decreased by an average of 53%, fueling a more than sevenfold increase in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration. Eighty-seven percent of the DOC loss to microbial uptake was derived from the low-molecular-weight (LMW) organic acids acetate and butyrate. To our knowledge, our study is the first to directly quantify high CO2 production rates from permafrost-derived LMW DOC mineralization. The observed DOC loss rates are among the highest reported for permafrost carbon and demonstrate the potential importance of LMW DOC in driving the rapid metabolism of Pleistocene-Age permafrost carbon upon thawand the outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere by soils and nearby inland waters.},

abstract={We present a new, process-based model of soil and stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC): the Integrated Catchments Model for Carbon (INCA-C). INCA-C is the first model of DOC cycling to explicitly include effects of different land cover types, hydrological flow paths, in-soil carbon biogeochemistry, and surface water processes on in-stream DOC concentrations. It can be calibrated using only routinely available monitoring data. INCA-C simulates daily DOC concentrations over a period of years to decades. Sources, sinks, and transformation of solid and dissolved organic carbon in peat and forest soils, wetlands, and streams as well as organic carbon mineralization in stream waters are modeled. INCA-C is designed to be applied to natural and seminatural forested and peat-dominated catchments in boreal and temperate regions. Simulations at two forested catchments showed that seasonal and interannual patterns of DOC concentration could be modeled using climate-related parameters alone. A sensitivity analysis showed that model predictions were dependent on the mass of organic carbon in the soil and that in-soil process rates were dependent on soil moisture status. Sensitive rate coefficients in the model included those for organic carbon sorption and desorption and DOC mineralization in the soil. The model was also sensitive to the amount of litter fall. Our results show the importance of climate variability in controlling surface water DOC concentrations and suggest the need for further research on the mechanisms controlling production and consumption of DOC in soils.

abstract={Thermal gradient apparatus has been used to study enzyme activity and carbon cycling in peat collected seasonally from a Northern upland peatland. A thermal optimum was observed in the peat where maximum carbon-cycling enzyme activities (phenol oxidase and β-glucosidase), phenolic compound concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and microbial respiration (CO2 efflux) were all found in a given season. The thermal optimum for these carbon-cycling processes coincided with the highest ambient soil temperature recorded at the time of peat collection, suggesting microbial acclimation to the external conditions. Under the waterlogged conditions of this experiment, phenol oxidase activites correlated positively with phenolic compounds (winter 0.96, P&lt;0.01; spring 0.92, P&lt;0.001; summer 0.94, P&lt;0.001; autumn 0.88, P&lt;0.001) and β-glucosidase activities with DOC (winter 0.91, P&lt;0.01; spring 0.85, P&lt;0.01; summer 0.92, P&lt;0.001; autumn 0.72, P&lt;0.05). We propose, therefore, that the relative activities of these enzymes is crucial in mobilising DOC from the peat matrix, with implications for carbon exports to the receiving waters (magnitude and molecular weight distribution) and CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. The pronounced seasonality in carbon processing found here, must be taken into account when modelling carbon flux in and from these systems, if responses to climate change are to be predicted satisfactorily. Furthermore, because the optimum activity of these carbon-cycling enzymes shifted with seasonal changes in temperature, it is essential to perform enzyme assays in soil ecological investigations at field temperatures (rather than standardised temperatures), when information on natural process rates is required. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this study, we tested a simple and rapid method for the estimation of carbon in the hydrophobic fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of different origin (spruce, pine, and beech litter) in soil water. The method is based on the fact that the hydrophobic fraction of DOM contains almost entirely the aromatic moieties of DOM. Thus, it showed a clearly distinct light absorption at 260 nm compared to the hydrophilic fraction. This light absorption was directly proportional to the concentration of the hydrophobic fraction. Moreover, it was independent of the concentration of the hydrophilic fraction. We compared the concentrations of hydrophobic DOM estimated by the UV method with those of the conventional fractionation using chromatographic columns of XAD-8 macroporous resin and found an excellent agreement between the two methods for both solutions from laboratory sorption experiments and field samples of forest floor leachates and subsoil porewaters. In addition, the absorption at 260 nm of hydrophobic DOM proved to be independent of pH values ranging from 2.0 to 6.5. Compared to the conventional chromatographic fractionation, the method using the UV absorption at 260 nm is less time consuming, needs a much smaller sample volume, and showed a better reproducibility. However, its use is restricted to water samples of low nitrate (&lt;25 mg L-1) and Fe (&lt;5 mg L-1) concentrations and, probably, with the hydrophobic fraction dominated by aromatic compounds deriving from degradation of lignin. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={We have examined the effects of individual members of the two dominant functional groups of the Macoma balthica community on fluxes of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon between sediment and overlying water. The biodiffusers M. balthica and Mya arenaria and the gallery-diffuser Nereis virens were added to microcosms containing sieved tidal flat sediment, using identical biovolume for each treatment to facilitate comparison. Both functional groups enhanced fluxes over a control without macrofauna. The gallery-diffuser had the greatest effect. The two biodiffusers had opposite effects on the flux of nitrate. M. balthica, which lives near the sediment surface, caused nitrate release whereas M. arenaria caused nitrate uptake. Both organisms increased the release of ammonia, but M. arenaria had the greater effect. We attribute this intra-functional difference not so much to different functionality as to interactions between organisms and the depth distribution of pore water constituents. Because the burrow of M. balthica is located within the nitrification zone of the sediment, the depth averaged concentration of nitrate in its burrow is higher than in the overlying water, and burrow flushing leads to net release of nitrate. In contrast, the burrow of M. arenaria includes both nitrification and denitrification zones, which lower the depth averaged concentration of nitrate below the concentration in the overlying water. The functional group approach needs to take the processes that control sediment chemistry into account in order to predict fluxes sucessfully. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Coagulation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by hydrolyzing metals is an important environmental process with particular relevance, e.g., for the cycling of organic matter in metal-rich aquatic systems or the flocculation of organic matter in wastewater treatment plants. Often, a nonremovable fraction of DOM remains in solution even at low DOM/metal ratios. Because coagulation by metals results from interactions with functional groups, we hypothesize that noncoagulating fractions have a distinct molecular composition. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed peat-derived dissolved organic matter remaining in solution after mixing with salts of Ca, Al, and Fe using 15 T Electrospray Ionization Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). Addition of metals resulted in a net removal of DOM. Also a reduction of molecular diversity was observed, as the number of peaks from the ESI-FT-ICR-MS spectra decreased. At DOM/metal ratios of ∼9 Ca did not show any preference for distinct molecular fractions, while Fe and Al removed preferentially the most oxidized compounds (O/C ratio >0.4) of the peat leachate. Lowering DOM/metal ratios to ∼1 resulted in further removal of less oxidized as well as more aromatic compounds ("black carbon"). Molecular composition in the residual solution after coagulation was more saturated, less polar, and less oxidized compared to the original peat leachate and exhibited a surprising similarity with DOM of marine origin. By identifying more than 9200 molecular formulas we can show that structural properties (saturation and aromaticity) and oxygen content of individual DOM molecules play an important role in coagulation with metals. We conclude that polyvalent cations not only alter the net mobility but also the very molecular composition of DOM in aquatic environments. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Spectral absorption coefficients and fluorescence quantum efficiencies were determined for humic substances from a variety of sources. Specific absorption coefficients kh, for humic substances at wavelengths λ from 300 to 500 nm can be closely described by the relation AeB(450-λ), where A and B are constants. When the kh values are in units of liter (mg organic carbon)-1meter-1 and wavelength λ is in nanometers, mean values of A and B for aquatic humus in the 12 water bodies studied were 0.6±0.3 and 0.014±0.001, respectively. Spectral absorption coefficients of dissolved organic matter in blackwater rivers, of the "yellow substance" in the sea, and of fulvic acids extracted from soils are very similar. Fluorescence quantum yields of humic substances were low and more variable than the absorption coefficients, ranging from 0.0005 to 0.012 with excitation at 350 nm (average of 0.0045±0.0038 for 6 waters). Fluorescence spectra for the humic substances were remarkably similar with maximum emission at 430 to 470 nm. Results of this study can be used to compute photolysis rates of pollutants as a function of depth in natural water bodies. © 1981.},

abstract={New conceptual models that highlight the importance of environmental, rather than molecular, controls on soil organic matter affect interpretations of organic matter (OM) persistence across terrestrial and aquatic boundaries. We propose that changing paradigms in our thinking about OM decomposition explain some of the uncertainties surrounding the fate of land-derived carbon (C) in marine environments. Terrestrial OM, which historically has been thought to be chemically recalcitrant to decay in soil and aquatic environments, dominates inputs to rivers yet is found in trace amounts in the ocean. We discuss three major transformations in our understanding of OM persistence that influence interpretations of the fate of aquatic OM: (1) a shift away from an emphasis on chemical recalcitrance as a primary predictor of turnover; (2) new interpretations of radiocarbon ages, which affect predictions of reactivity; and (3) the recognition that most OM leaving soils in dissolved form has been microbially processed. The first two explain rapid turnover for terrigenous OM in aquatic ecosystems once it leaves the soil matrix. The third suggests that the presence of terrestrial OM in aquatic ecosystems may be underestimated by the use of plant biomarkers. Whether these mechanisms occur in isolation of each other or in combination, they provide insight into the missing terrestrial C signature in the ocean. Spatially and temporally varying transformations of OM along land-water networks require that common terrestrial source indicators be interpreted within specific environmental contexts. We identify areas of research where collaborations between aquatic and terrestrial scientists will enhance quantification of C transfer from soils to inland water bodies, the ocean, and the atmosphere. Accurate estimates of OM processing are essential for improving predictions of the response of vulnerable C pools at the interface of soil and water to changes in climate and land use. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Arsenic is contaminating the groundwater of Holocene aquifers throughout South and Southeast Asia. To examine the biogeochemical and hydrological processes influencing dissolved concentrations and transport of As within soils/sediments in the Mekong River delta, a ∼50 km2 field site was established near Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where aqueous As concentrations are dangerously high and where groundwater retrieval for irrigation is minimal. Dissolved As concentrations vary spatially, ranging up to 1300 μg/L in aquifer groundwater and up to 600 μg/L in surficial clay pore water. Groundwaters with high As concentrations are reducing with negligible dissolved O2 and high concentrations of Fe(II), NH4+, and dissolved organic C. Within near-surface environments, these conditions are most pronounced in sediments underlying permanent wetlands, often found within oxbow channels near the Mekong River. There, labile C, co-deposited with As-bearing Fe (hydr)oxides under reducing conditions, drives the reductive mobilization (inclusive of Fe and As reduction) of As. Here, conditions are described under which As is mobilized from these sediments, and near-surface As release is linked to aquifer contamination over long time periods (100s to 1000s of years). Site biogeochemistry is coupled with extensive hydrologic measurements, and, accordingly, a comprehensive interpretation of spatial As release and transport within a calibrated hydraulic flow-field is provided of an As-contaminated aquifer that is representative of those found throughout South and Southeast Asia. © 2008.},

abstract={Adsorption of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) by virgin and modified granular activated carbons (GACs) was studied. DOM samples were obtained from two water treatment plants before (i.e., raw water) and after coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation processes (i.e., treated water). A granular activated carbon (GAC) was modified by high temperature helium or ammonia treatment, or iron impregnation followed by high temperature ammonia treatment. Two activated carbon fibers (ACFs) were also used, with no modification, to examine the effect of carbon porosity on DOM adsorption. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA 254) were employed to characterize the DOMs before and after adsorption. Iron-impregnated (HDFe) and ammonia-treated (HDN) activated carbons showed significantly higher DOM uptakes than the virgin GAC. The enhanced DOM uptake by HDFe was due to the presence of iron species on the carbon surface. The higher uptake of HDN was attributed to the enlarged carbon pores and basic surface created during ammonia treatment. The SEC and SUVA254 results showed no specific selectivity in the removal of different DOM components as a result of carbon modification. The removal of DOM from both raw and treated waters was negligible by ACF10, having 96% of its surface area in pores smaller than 1 nm. Small molecular weight (MW) DOM components were preferentially removed by ACF20H, having 33% of its surface area in 1-3 nm pores. DOM components with MWs larger than 1600, 2000, and 2700 Da of Charleston raw, Charleston-treated, and Spartanburg-treated waters, respectively, were excluded from the pores of ACF20H. In contrast to carbon fibers, DOM components from entire MW range were removed from waters by virgin and modified GACs. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The penetration of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) was measured in a range of subarctic lakes in the forest-tundra zone of northern Quebec. The diffuse attenuation coefficients for PAR (K(dPAR)) were highly correlated (r2 = 0.78) with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and only weakly correlated with suspended particulate material as measured by chlorophyll a (r2 = 0.48) or beam transmittance (r2 = 0.29). Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was also largely responsible for the between-lake differences in spectral attenuation of UVR. The diffuse attenuation coefficient for UVR (K(d)) was a nonlinear function of wavelength (λ) and was accurately described by the model K(d) (λ) = K(d440) exp(-S [λ-440]). The slope coefficient S was relatively constant among lakes (mean = 0.0151 nm-1, CV = 7%), whereas K(d440) was a linear function of several CDOM-related variables and best estimated by CDOM fluorescence (r2 = 0.98). Numerical analysis of spectra for high (subarctic) and low (Arctic) DOC lakes showed that the evaluation of the model parameters K(d440) and S was insensitive to the bandpass characteristics (2-8 nm) of different underwater radiometers. The K(d) (λ) model was then used to develop a nondimensional index of relative spectral composition (RI) to characterize different water masses as a function of dissolved organic matter (DOC and CDOM fluorescence). Below about 4 mg DOC L-1 there is a sharp nonlinear rise in this index with decreasing DOC. These results show that CDOM controls the spectral composition of underwater UVR in northern high-latitude lakes and that the UVR/PAR balance in many of these waters is sensitive to minor changes in CDOM content.},

abstract={The effect of particle size, mineralogy and sediment organic carbon (SOC) on sorption of tetrachlorobenzene and pentachlorobenzene was evaluated using batch-isotherm experiments on sediment particle-size and mineralogical fractions from a sand and gravel aquifer, Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Concentration of SOC and sorption of chlorobenzenes increase with decreasing particle size. For a given particle size, the magnetic fraction has a higher SOC content and sorption capacity than the bulk or non-magnetic fractions. Sorption appears to be controlled by the magnetic minerals, which comprise only 5-25% of the bulk sediment. Although SOC content of the bulk sediment is <0.1%, the observed sorption of chlorobenzenes is consistent with a partition mechanism and is adequately predicted by models relating sorption to the octanol/water partition coefficient of the solute and SOC content. A conceptual model based on preferential association of dissolved organic matter with positively-charged mineral surfaces is proposed to describe micro-scale, intergranular variability in sorption properties of the aquifer sediments. © 1992.},

abstract={In this study, we examined changes in isotopic (13C and 14C) and spectroscopic (UV and 13C NMR) properties of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in relation to soil organic matter (SOM) to elucidate the sources and sinks of DOC as water percolates through the soils of two contrasting upland coastal California ecosystems-a redwood forest and a coastal prairie. Despite differences in the distribution of C stocks and litter chemistry at these two sites, we found similar shifts in DOC chemistry with soil depth. DOC concentrations dropped rapidly with increasing depth, with an accompanying decrease in the C:N ratio, an increase in the δ13C value and an decrease in specific UV adsorption. In the grassland soil, Δ14C values declined from current atmospheric values (+70‰) in the surface horizon to -75‰ at 100 cm. In the redwood soil, the Δ14C value of 111‰ in O horizon leachates was indicative of OM with a residence time of 8-10 yrs, with a decrease in Δ14C values to -80‰ at 100 cm. Solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR spectra were generally most similar to highly humified OM, with a general decrease in the relative abundance of aromatic compounds and an increase in the alkyl C/O-alkyl C ratio with increasing depth. All of these trends are consistent with the shifts in SOM properties with increasing depth, which are interpreted to mean a shift from fresh plant material to older, highly altered OM. In this Mediterranean climate, we found distinct seasonal shifts in the quantity and composition of DOC found in soil solution during the winter rainy period that was also consistent with a shift from recent labile substrates to older, highly altered OM. These results fit in with a growing body of literature suggesting that the source of much of the DOC within mineral soils is the local soil OM, and the 14C data, in particular, indicate that DOC at depth is not simply the fraction of surficial leachates that have not been adsorbed or decomposed. Rather, exchange reactions with a portion of the more stabilized SOM pool exert the strongest control on both the concentration and composition of DOC found in these soils. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Climate models predict precipitation changes for much of the humid tropics, yet few studies have investigated the potential consequences of drought on soil carbon (C) cycling in this important biome. In wet tropical forests, drought could stimulate soil respiration via overall reductions in soil anoxia, but previous research suggests that litter decomposition is positively correlated with high rainfall fluxes that move large quantities of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the litter layer to the soil surface. Thus, reduced rainfall could also limit C delivery to the soil surface, reducing respiration rates. We conducted a throughfall manipulation experiment to investigate how 25% and 50% reductions in rainfall altered both C movement into soils and the effects of those DOM fluxes on soil respiration rates. In response to the experimental drought, soil respiration rates increased in both the -25% and -50% treatments. Throughfall fluxes were reduced by 26% and 55% in the-25% and-50% treatments, respectively. However, total DOM fluxes leached from the litter did not vary between treatments, because the concentrations of leached DOM reaching the soil surface increased in response to the simulated drought. Annual DOM concentrations averaged 7.7 × 0.8, 11.2 × 0.9, and 15.8 × 1.2 mg C/L in the control, -25%, and -50% plots, respectively, and DOM concentrations were positively correlated with soil respiration rates. A laboratory incubation experiment confirmed the potential importance of DOM concentration on soil respiration rates, suggesting that this mechanism could contribute to the increase in CO2 fluxes observed in the reduced rainfall plots. Across all plots, the data suggested that soil CO2 fluxes were partially regulated by the magnitude and concentration of soluble C delivered to the soil, but also by soil moisture and soil oxygen availability. Together, our data suggest that declines in precipitation in tropical rain forests could drive higher CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere both via increased soil O2 availability and through responses to elevated DOM concentrations. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={The individual effects of salinity and sodicity on organic matter dynamics are well known but less is known about their interactive effects. We conducted a laboratory incubation experiment to assess soil respiration and dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in response to salinity and sodicity in two soils of different texture. Two non-saline non-sodic soils (a sand and a sandy clay loam) were leached 3-4 times with solutions containing different concentrations of NaCl and CaCl 2 to reach almost identical electrical conductivity (EC 1:5) in both soils (EC 1:5 0.5, 1.3, 2.5 and 4.0 dS m -1 in the sand and EC 1:5 0.7, 1.4, 2.5 and 4.0 dS m -1 in the sandy clay loam) combined with two sodium absorption ratios: SAR &lt; 3 and 20. Finely ground wheat straw residue was added (20 g kg -1) as substrate to stimulate microbial activity. Cumulative respiration was more strongly affected by EC than by SAR. It decreased by 8% at EC 1.3 and by 60% at EC 4.0 in the sand, whereas EC had no effect on respiration in the sandy clay loam. The apparent differential sensitivity to EC in the two soils can be explained by their different water content and therefore, different osmotic potential at the same EC. At almost similar osmotic potential: -2.92 MPa in sand (at EC 1.3) and -2.76 MPa in the sandy clay loam (at EC 4.0) the relative decrease in respiration was similar (8-9%). Sodicity had little effect on cumulative respiration in the soils, but DOC, DON and specific ultra-violet absorbance (SUVA) were significantly higher at SAR 20 than at SAR &lt; 3 in combination with low EC in both soils (EC 0.5 in the sand and EC 0.7 and 1.4 in the sandy clay loam). Therefore, high SAR in combination with low EC is likely to increase the risk of DOC and DON leaching in the salt-affected soils, which may lead to further soil degradation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Land usage is a strong determinant of soil microbial community composition and activity, which in turn determine organic matter decomposition rates and decomposition products in soils. Microbial communities in permanently flooded wetlands, such as those created by wetland restoration on Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta islands in California, function under restricted aeration conditions that result in increasing anaerobiosis with depth. It was hypothesized that the change from agricultural management to permanently flooded wetland would alter microbial community composition, increase the amount and reactivity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compounds in Delta waters; and have a predominant impact on microbial communities as compared with the effects of other environmental factors including soil type and agricultural management. Based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, active microbial communities of the restored wetlands were changed significantly from those of the agricultural fields, and wetland microbial communities varied widely with soil depth. The relative abundance of monounsaturated fatty acids decreased with increasing soil depth in both wetland and agricultural profiles, whereas branched fatty acids were relatively more abundant at all soil depths in wetlands as compared to agricultural fields. Decomposition conditions were linked to DOC quantity and quality using fatty acid functional groups to conclude that restricted aeration conditions found in the wetlands were strongly related to production of reactive carbon compounds. But current vegetation may have had an equally important role in determining DOC quality in restored wetlands. In a larger scale analysis, that included data from wetland and agricultural sites on Delta islands and data from two previous studies from the Sacramento Valley, an aeration gradient was defined as the predominant determinant of active microbial communities across soil types and land usage. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Soil and plant tissues were used to examine the effect on the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of rinsing over time at two temperatures and under oxic and anoxic conditions in a laboratory incubation. The release of DOC over 60 days of incubation ranged from 0.5 to 189 mg DOC g-1 oven-dry material and was correlated inversely with the degree of decomposition of the material: fresh maple leaves &gt; old maple leaves &gt; Sphagnum moss &gt; fibric peat &gt; hemic peat = sapric peat &gt; Inceptisol A horizon. Rates of DOC release were similar through the duration of the experiment, except for the fresh maple leaves, where release rates fell after 3 day. Rinsing, by the replacement of water in the incubating samples after 20 day, produced slower rates of DOC release, except in the Inceptisol A and sapric peat samples. There was no significant difference between DOC release under oxic and anoxic conditions, except for the Inceptisol A soil, where DOC release was greater under anoxic than under oxic conditions. The rate of DOC release at 22°C was an average of 2.4 times greater than at 4°C, translating into Q10 values of about 1.6. At 22°C under oxic conditions, DOC production accounted for 14 to 58% (average 24%) of the total C released as DOC + CO2, with the highest proportion in the maple leaves. Under anoxic conditions, DOC production accounted for 63 to 95% (average 82%) of the total C released as DOC + CO2 + CH4. Production of CH4 under anoxic conditions was minor, accounting for &lt;1% of the total C released. Under oxic conditions at 22°C, the incubations released between 2 and 107% of the organic C contained in the samples, the largest proportion of which was released from the plant tissues. Microbial utilization of DOC meant that some C was double-counted, both as DOC and as subsequently emitted CO2. Under anoxic conditions, 0.0 to 49% of the sample organic C was mineralized. The release of DOC represents the balance between production, adsorption, and desorption and microbial utilization. This release differs clearly among samples and among treatment effects.},

abstract={The affinity of soil organic matter for water influences resistance to microbial degradation, the rate of wetting and adsorption processes. Such properties play key roles in organic matter and microbial biomass dynamics, aggregate stability, water infiltration, leaching of organic and inorganic pollutants, chemical composition and the dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The hydrophobicity of the organic matter as a function of management have been studied in two soils with contrasting textures using diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT). The results show that agricultural management clearly influences the amount of aliphatic C-H units and implicitly the hydrophobicity of the soil organic matter. A decrease of organic C due to management is accompanied by a decrease of hydrophobicity as well as of soil microbial activity and aggregate stability. The hydrophobicity index is a sensitive quantity to characterize the 'quality' of soil organic matter. DRIFT spectroscopy proves to be a rapid and reliable technique to determine quantitatively the hydrophobicity of soil organic matter.},

abstract={Recent climate change has increased arctic soil temperatures and thawed large areas of permafrost, allowing for microbial respiration of previously frozen C. Furthermore, soil destabilization from melting ice has caused an increase in thermokarst failures that expose buried C and release dissolved organic C (DOC) to surface waters. Once exposed, the fate of this C is unknown but will depend on its reactivity to sunlight and microbial attack, and the light available at the surface. In this study we manipulated water released from areas of thermokarst activity to show that newly exposed DOC is &gt;40% more susceptible to microbial conversion to CO2 when exposed to UV light than when kept dark. When integrated over the water column of receiving rivers, this susceptibility translates to the light-stimulated bacterial activity being on average from 11% to 40% of the total areal activity in turbid versus DOC-colored rivers, respectively. The range of DOC lability to microbes seems to depend on prior light exposure, implying that sunlight may act as an amplification factor in the conversion of frozen C stores to C gases in the atmosphere.},

abstract={Agroecological zones within Bangladesh with low levels of arsenic in groundwater and soils produce rice that is high in arsenic with respect to other producing regions of the globe. Little is known about arsenic cycling in these soils and the labile fractions relevant for plant uptake when flooded. Soil porewater dynamics of field soils (n = 39) were recreated under standardized laboratory conditions to investigate the mobility and interplay of arsenic, Fe, Si, C, and other elements, in relation to rice grain element composition, using the dynamic sampling technique diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT). Based on a simple model using only labile DGT measured arsenic and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), concentrations of arsenic in Aman (Monsoon season) rice grain were predicted reliably. DOC was the strongest determinant of arsenic solid-solution phase partitioning, while arsenic release to the soil porewater was shown to be decoupled from that of Fe. This study demonstrates the dual importance of organic matter (OM), in terms of enhancing arsenic release from soils, while reducing bioavailability by sequestering arsenic in solution. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The benefits of adding composted organic materials to soils to enhance carbon storage could be countered by the mobilisation of some harmful pollutants commonly found in frequently degraded urban soils. Therefore non-composted materials could be a safer option. In the present study, carbon and trace element fluxes in soil pore water were studied in response to the surface mulch addition and the incorporation into an urban soil of greenwaste compost versus two non-composted amendments; a woody oversize material and biochar following inoculation with the vertical burrowing earthworm Lumbricus terrestris. The aim was to establish (i) to what extent the non-composted amendments impacted on mobility of soluble trace elements in the soil, compared to the composted amendment, and (ii) if/how this was regulated by earthworm activity.Both composted and non-composted amendments enhanced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil pore water to ∼100-300 mg l-1 in the upper depth of the soil profile above which they were applied as a mulch and similarly within the mesocosms in which they were mixed. Dissolved organic carbon, dissolved nitrogen (DTN) and trace metals, especially Cu and Pb, where enhanced to the greatest extent by greenwaste compost, because of strong co-mobilisation of metals by DOC. Biochar enhanced As and Cu mobility in the field profile and, additionally Pb in the mesocosms, with no effect on Cd. The woody, oversize amendment neither greatly increased DOC nor As, Cu, Pb or Zn mobility although, unlike the other amendments, earthworms increased DOC and Cd mobility when soils were amended with this material.This study concludes that non-composted amendments had a lower impact on DOC and thus trace element co-mobility than the composted greenwaste in this urban soil, whilst the general influence of earthworms was to reduce DOC and hence associated trace element mobility. In wider environmental terms the addition of non-composted materials to some urban soils, versus composted greenwaste could reduce the risk of mobilising potentially harmful elements, whilst usefully improving soil quality. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Dissolved forms of carbon and nitrogen have become recognized for their importance in forest nutrient cycling. The role of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as an energy source for microbial metabolism is of particular interest. A laboratory decomposition experiment was conducted to examine the relationship between potential increased N inputs (via acid deposition) and DOC production in the forest litter layer and subsequent effects on DOC availability in the forest floor. Air-dried leaf litter (seven species) was treated with nitrogen (nitrate or ammonium) or deionized (DI) water at weekly intervals throughout 15 weeks and leached with DI water at 1 or 2 week intervals. Leachate was analyzed for DOC, inorganic nitrogen (NO3/--N and NH4+-N) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Litter was analyzed for percent C, percent N, weight loss and percent cellulose and lignin. Nitrogen treatments did not greatly affect DOC concentrations in litter leachate. Differences in DOC concentrations were primarily due to a wide range of initial litter chemistries, where species with high extractives and low lignin had the highest DOC leachate concentrations. Nitrogen treated samples showed greater weight loss than controls although nitrate and ammonium treatments were not significantly different. Between 6 and 39% of total carbon loss was leached as DOC. These findings suggest that different forest types could vary greatly in the quantity of carbon consumed or released and that nitrogen inputs appear to affect this overall cycle by increasing respiration (as measured by weight loss), rather than increasing DOC release into the soil solution. Further examination of the fate of DOC as it moves down in the soil profile and measurements of CO2 evolution during laboratory decomposition, are necessary to better understand these processes.

abstract={Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial sources forms the major component of the annual carbon budget in many headwater streams. In high-elevation catchments in the Rocky Mountains, DOC originates in the upper soil horizons and is flushed to the stream primarily during spring snowmelt. To identify controls on the size of the mobile soil DOC pool available to be transported during the annual melt event, we measured soil DOC production across a range of vegetation communities and soil types together with catchment DOC export in paired watersheds in Summit County, Colorado. Both surface water DOC concentrations and watershed DOC export were lower in areas where pyrite weathering resulted in lower soil pH. Similarly, the amount of DOC leached from organic soils was significantly smaller (p &lt; 0.01) at sites having low soil p H. Scaling point source measurements of DOC production and leaching to the two basins and assuming only vegetated areas contribute to DOC production, we calculated that the amount of mobile DOC available to be leached to surface water during melt was 20.3 g C m-2 in the circumneutral basin and 17.8 g C m-2 in the catchment characterized by pyrite weathering. The significant (r2 = 0.91 and p &lt; 0.05), linear relationship between overwinter CO2 flux and the amount of DOC leached from upper soil horizons during snowmelt suggests that the mechanism for the difference in production of mobile DOC was heterotrophic processing of soil carbon in snow-covered soil. Furthermore, this strong relationship between over-winter heterotrophic activity and the size of the mobile DOC pool present in a range of soil and vegetation types provides a likely mechanism for explaining the interannual variability of DOC export observed in high-elevation catchments.},

Pore water concentrations of total PCBs, expressed as Aroclor 1254, increased with depth in the sediments with a maximum concentration of 17.1 μg/L at 9-11 cm. Apparent distribution coefficients of individual chlorobiphenyls decreased with depth and were related to dissolved organic carbon levels. Results from this site suggest that most of the PCBs in interstitial waters are sorbed to organic colloids. A simple three-phase equilibrium sorption model can explain many features of the data. Changes in the composition of individual chlorobiphenyls in the sediments were also apparent. Microbial degradation appears to be responsible for large relative depletions of several chlorobiphenyls with depth in the core. © 1986.},

abstract={Carbon and nitrogen mineralization were determined along a transect from a mangrove forest to a seagrass meadow in the Bangrong area, Phuket Island, Thailand. Vertical sediment profiles of carbon oxidation were measured as sulfate reduction rates (SRR) using the 35S technique and by monitoring net TCO2 and DOC production and Fe(III) reduction using anaerobic sediment incubations ('jar' technique). Nitrogen transformations were measured simultaneously as net NH4+ and DON production. In addition, total benthic metabolism and net nitrogen exchange were determined as fluxes of O2, TCO2, DOC, and DIN (NO3- and NH4+) across the sediment-water interface. Rates of carbon and nitrogen transformations in this vascular-plant (high C:N)-dominated area were low compared with areas fuelled by detritus of marine origin (low C:N). It appears that the high content of structural biopolymers (e.g. lignocelluloses) hampers microbial activity. Suboxic respiration with Fe(III) as electron acceptor accounted for 70 to 80% of the total carbon oxidation in the rooted mangrove forest sediment, whereas SRR and aerobic respiration were responsible for about 20 and &lt;6%, respectively. The role of SRR decreased to about 10% and aerobic respiration increased to 45-65% in an adjacent bioturbated mudflat, while Fe(III) respiration decreased to 30-40%. At the sand flat and seagrass meadow outside the mangrove forest, Fe(III) respiration only accounted for 15 and ∼0%, respectively, whereas SRR was responsible for 20 to 45% of the total carbon oxidation. However, the most important electron acceptor in the area outside was oxygen (55 to 75%). The shift in dominance of electron acceptors along the transect is primarily related to the presence of roots and infauna, but the sediment composition (e.g. grain size, organic content and iron content) is believed to be an important co-factor. The net production of ammonammonium in the sediment was not balanced by fluxes of DIN across the sediment-water interface. The missing nitrogen was assigned to a rapid and efficient bacterial ammonium assimilation at the sediment surface as indicated by ammonium turnover times of about 1 d.},

abstract={Characterization of pore water chemistry necessitates measurements of the chemical components at a high spatial resolution due to the heterogeneous nature of sediments. In this study, a novel high-resolution dialysis technique was developed for rapid sampling of dissolved reactive phosphate (DRP) and ferrous iron (Fe) in pore water at a vertical resolution of 2. mm. This technique employed a mini dialysis device (peeper) with a deployment time of 2. days in sediments for equilibration. Operational procedures following retrieval of the peeper include in situ freezing of the pore water samples through spraying commercial carbon dioxide snow, frozen storage of the pore water samples, and quick analysis of chemicals in pore water samples using 384-well microplate photometric methods. The sample consumption for each parameter can be minimized to 6 μL, which allowed simultaneous determination of DRP and ferrous iron in a peeper device. Laboratory tests showed that the technique was robust enough for the in situ measurements. Field deployment was subsequently performed in three sites of a shallow, eutrophic bay in Lake Taihu of China. Simultaneous determination of DRP and ferrous Fe in all the sites demonstrated a similar behavior of both chemicals in the pore water profiles, verifying the control of P mobilization by Fe in sediments. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The binding of mercury(II) to two peats from Florida Everglades sites with different rates of mercury methylation was measured at pH 6.0 and 0.01 M ionic strength. The mercury(II) sorption isotherms, measured over a total mercury(II) range of 10-7.4 to 10-3.7 M, showed the competition for mercury(II) between the peat and dissolved organic matter released from the peat and the existence of strong and weak binding sites for mercury(II). Binding was portrayed by a model accounting for strong and weak sites on both the peat and the released DOM. The conditional binding constants (for which the ligand concentration was set as the concentration of reduced sulfur in the organic matter as measured by X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy) determined for the strong sites on the two peats were similar (Kpeat,s = 1021.8±0.1 and 1022.0±0.1 M-1), but less than those determined for the DOM strong sites (Kdom,s = 1022.8±0.1 and 1023.2±0.1 M-1), resulting in mercury(II) binding by the DOM at low mercury(II) concentrations. The magnitude of the strong site binding constant is indicative of mercury(II) interaction with organic thiol functional groups. The conditional binding constants determined for the weak peat sites (Kpeat,w = 1011.5±0.1 and 1011.8±0.1 M-1) and weak DOM sites (Kdom,w = 108.7±3.0 and 107.3±4.5 M-1) were indicative of mercury(II) interaction with carboxyl and phenol functional groups.},

abstract={Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is an abundant but poorly understood pool of N in many ecosystems. We assessed DON cycling in a N-limited headwater forest stream via whole-ecosystem additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and labile dissolved organic matter (DOM), hydrologic transport and biogeochemical modeling, and laboratory experiments with native sediments. We sampled surface and subsurface waters to understand how interaction among hydrologic exchange, DIN, DON, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) influence stream N losses at summer baseflow. Added DON was taken up rapidly from the water column at rates exceeding DOC and DIN. A significant fraction of this DON was mineralized and nitrified. Combined DON and NO3-N uptake lengths resulted in spiraling lengths of ∼210 m, suggesting the potential for multiple transformations of labile N loads within catchment boundaries. Simultaneous addition of DIN increased DOM uptake, but more so for C, resulting in an upward shift in the C:N ratio of uptake. Sediment incubations also showed a strong biotic influence on DOC and DON dynamics. Despite efficient uptake of added DOM, background DON and high molecular mass DOC concentrations increased downstream, resulting in higher DOM loads than could be accounted for by groundwater discharge and suggesting net release of less bioavailable forms from the channel/hyporheic zone. At the same time, subsurface DOM was characterized by very low C:N ratios and a disproportionately large DON pool despite rapid hydrologic mixing with dilute and high C:N ratio surface waters. Analysis of expected DON loads from conservative hyporheic fluxes indicated that watershed losses of DON would have been seven times greater in the absence of apparent benthic demand, suggesting tight internal cycling of subsurface DON. Our study further demonstrates the potential for significant transformation of N in headwater streams before export to downstream ecosystems. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Variation in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of surface waters is a consequence of process changes in the surrounding terrestrial environment, both within annual cycles and over the longer term. Long-term records (1987-2006) of DOC concentrations at six catchments (0.44-10.0 km 2) across a climatic transect in Scotland were investigated for intra-annual relationships to evaluate potential long-term seasonal patterns. The intra-annual mode of DOC export contrasted markedly between catchments and appeared dependent on their hydrological characteristics. Catchments in wetter Central Scotland with high rainfall-runoff ratios, short transit times and well-connected responsive soils show a distinct annual periodicity in DOC concentrations throughout the long-term datasets. Increased DOC concentrations occurred between June and November with correspondingly lower DOC concentrations from December to May. This appears unrelated to discharge, and is dependent mainly on higher temperatures driving biological activity, increasing decomposition of available organic matter and solubility of DOC. The drier eastern catchments have lower rainfall-runoff ratios, longer transit times and annual drying-wetting regimes linked to changing connectivity of soils. These are characterised by seasonal DOC concentration-discharge relationships with an autumnal flush of DOC. Temperature influences the availability of organic matter for DOC transport producing a high DOC concentration-discharge relationship in summer/autumn and low DOC concentration-discharge relationship in winter/spring. These two distinct modes of seasonal DOC transport have important implications for understanding changes in DOC concentrations and export brought about by climate change (temperature and precipitation) and modelling of aquatic carbon losses from soil-types under different hydrological regimes. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the transport of hydrophobic organic compounds in soil columns were investigated. Three compounds (naphthalene, phenanthrene and DDT) that spanned three orders of magnitude in water solubility were used. Instead of humic matter, molecularly well‐defined DOM represented by Triton X‐100, a nonionic industrial detergent, and bovine serum albumin protein were used. In batch isotherm studies, the sorption of naphthalene to both model DOMs appeared to be hydrophobic in nature and quantitatively similar to the binding to humic materials. Equations were derived to model the enhanced transport of organic compounds by DOM based on octanol/water partition coefficients, Kow. For a specific soil and DOM level, it was shown theoretically and experimentally that all organic compounds with Kow values above a specific value should move at the same rate in ground water. In some situations, DOM can increase the movement of highly hydrophobic compounds, such as DDT, by a factor of a thousand or more. This enhanced transport in the presence of DOM can either be a problem, as with ground water contaminant spreading, or a benefit, as with contaminated aquifer cleanup. Copyright © 1990 SETAC},

abstract={Factors determining C turnover and microbial succession at the small scale are crucial for understanding C cycling in soils. We performed a microcosm experiment to study how soil moisture affects temporal patterns of C turnover in the detritusphere. Four treatments were applied to small soil cores with two different water contents (matric potential of -0.0063 and -0.0316 MPa) and with or without addition of 13C labelled rye residues (δ13C=299‰), which were placed on top. Microcosms were sampled after 3, 7, 14, 28, 56 and 84 days and soil cores were separated into layers with increasing distance to the litter. Gradients in soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, extracellular enzyme activity and microbial biomass were detected over a distance of 3 mm from the litter layer. At the end of the incubation, 35.6% of litter C remained on the surface of soils at -0.0063 MPa, whereas 41.7% remained on soils at -0.0316 MPa. Most of the lost litter C was mineralised to CO2, with 47.9% and 43.4% at -0.0063 and -0.0316 MPa, respectively. In both treatments about 6% were detected as newly formed soil organic carbon. During the initial phase of litter decomposition, bacteria dominated the mineralisation of easily available litter substrates. After 14 days fungi depolymerised more complex litter compounds, thereby producing new soluble substrates, which diffused into the soil. This pattern of differential substrate usage was paralleled by a lag phase of 3 days and a subsequent increase in enzyme activities. Increased soil water content accelerated the transport of soluble substrates, which influenced the temporal patterns of microbial growth and activity. Our results underline the importance of considering the interaction of soil microorganisms and physical processes at the small scale for the understanding of C cycling in soils. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Organic or inorganic colloids play a major role in the mobilization of trace elements in soils and waters. Environmental physicochemical parameters (pH, redox potential, temperature, pressure, ionic strength, etc.) are the controlling factors of the colloidal mobilization. This study was dedicated to follow the colloid-mediated mobilization of trace elements through time at the soil/water interface by means of an experimental approach. Soil column experiments were carried out using percolating synthetic solutions. The percolated solutions were ultrafiltrated with various decreasing cutoff thresholds to separate the different colloidal phases in which the dissolved organic carbon and trace element concentrations were measured. The major results which stem from this study are the following: (i) The data can be divided into different groups of organic compounds (microbial metabolites, fulvic acids, humic acids) with regard to their respective aromaticity and molecular weight. (ii) Three groups of elements can be distinguished based on their relationships with the colloidal phases: the first one corresponds to the so-called "truly" dissolved group (Li, B, K, Na, Rb, Si, Mg, Sr, Ca, Mn, Ba, and V). The second one can be considered as an intermediate group (Cu, Cd, Co, and Ni), while the third group gathers Al, Cr, U, Mo, Pb, Ti, Th, Fe, and rare earth elements (REE) carried by the organic colloidal pool. (iii) The data demonstrate that the fulvic acids seem to be a major organic carrier phase for trace elements such as Cu, Cd, Co, and Ni. By contrast, the trace elements belonging to the so-called colloidal pool were mostly mobilized by humic acids containing iron nanoparticles. Lead, Ti, and U were mobilized by iron nanoparticles bound to these humic acids. Thus, humic substances allowed directly or indirectly a colloidal transport of many insoluble trace elements either by binding trace elements or by stabilizing a ferric carrier phase. (iv) Finally, the results demonstrated also that REE were mostly mobilized by humic substances. The REE normalized patterns showed a middle REE downward concavity. Therefore, as previously shown elsewhere humic substances are a major control of REE speciation and REE fractionation patterns as well since the humic substance/metal ratio was the key parameter controlling the REE pattern shape. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Knowledge of trace element concentrations and mobility is important in the ecotoxicological assessment of contaminated soils. We analysed soil pore water under field conditions to provide new insights into the mobility of residual contaminants in the surface 50 cm of a highly contaminated woodland soil. Cadmium and Zn were highly mobile in the acidic soil, concentrations increasing with depth in soil pore water, showing considerable downward mobility. High levels of surface organic matter restricted the solubility of Cu, Pb and Sb, with highest concentrations being found close to the surface. Dissolved organic carbon in pore water had a strong influence on mobility of Cu, Zn, Pb and Sb. Elevated As had moved from the organic surface horizons but was largely immobilised in deeper layers and associated with Fe and Al oxides. The measured differential mobility of pollutants in the present study is highly relevant to protection of groundwater and other receptors. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={1. Groundwater nitrate contamination has become a worldwide problem as increasing amounts of nitrogen fertilisers are used in agriculture. Alluvial groundwater is uniquely juxtaposed between soils and streams. Hydrological connections among these subsystems regulate nutrient cycling. 2. We measured denitrification using an in situ acetylene-block assay in a nitrate- contaminated portion of the Garonne River catchment along a gradient of surface waterground water mixing during high (snowmelt) and low flow. 3. During high flow (mid-April to early June) the water table rose an average of 35 cm and river water penetrated the subsurface to a great extent in monitoring wells. Denitrification rates averaged 5.40 μgN2O L-1 min -1 during the high flow period, nearly double the average rate (2.91 μgN2O L-1 min-1) measured during base flow. This was driven by a strong increase in denitrification in groundwater under native riparian vegetation. Nitrate concentrations were significantly lower during high flow compared with base flow. Riparian patches had higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations that were more aromatic compared with the gravel bar patch closest to the river. 4. Multiple linear regression showed that the rate of denitrification was best predicted by the concentration of low molecular weight organic acids. These molecules are probably derived from decomposition of soil organic matter and are an important energy source for anaerobic respiratory processes like denitrification. The second best predictor was per cent surface water, reflecting higher denitrification rates during spring when hydrological connection between surface water and ground water was greatest. 5. Our results indicate that, while denitrification rates in Garonne River alluvium were spatially and temporally variable, denitrification was a significant NO3 sink during transport from the NO3- contaminated floodplain to the river. DOC availability and river-floodplain connectivity were important factors influencing observed spatial and temporal patterns.},

abstract={Understanding the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) in response to changing environment and management practices is crucial for minimizing the climatic impacts of rice agriculture. This study examined the effects of rice straw incorporation on total SOC, active SOC fractions, and carbon pool management index (CPMI) in a subtropical paddy field in China. The straw collected after harvesting the early and late paddy was incorporated immediately into the top 10cm soil at a rate of 3.3Mgha-1 and the top 40cm soil samples in the triplicate treatment, control and reference plots were analyzed for the concentrations of total SOC and four other active SOC fractions at the end of the early and late seasons. The concentrations of total soil organic carbon (SOC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in the straw application plots than in the controls by 7.1-128.6% for both the early and late paddy season. In general, significant and positive correlations were observed between SOC, DOC, LFOC, MBC and labile organic carbon (LOC) in the treatment and control plots for both early and late paddy (r=0.60-0.96, P&lt;0.05). Moreover, there were significant and positive correlations of total SOC and active SOC fractions with both soil water content (r=0.69-0.94, P&lt;0.01) as well as total soil nitrogen content (r=0.69-0.99, P&lt;0.05). Straw incorporation significantly increased CPMI and other active soil organic carbon pools in the early paddy field (P&lt;0.05), but had no significant effects on CPMI in the late paddy field. It is therefore better to incorporate straw residues in the aerobic condition during the early paddy season in order for rice to benefit from an increased CPMI. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cadmium and zinc were added at 3 and 300 mg kg-1, respectively, to 23 soils and incubated at 16°C and 80% field capacity for 818 d. Following addition of metal, changes in the radio-labile concentrations of both elements were examined on seven separate sampling occasions over 818 d. At each sample time, soil pore water was extracted using Rhizon soil solution samplers, and concentrations of Cd, Zn, dissolved organic carbon, and major cations and anions were determined. The chemical speciation program WHAM 6 was used to determine free metal ion activity, (M2+). Similar measurements were made on a set of historically contaminated soils from old mining areas, sewage sludge disposal facilities, and industrial sources. The two data sets were combined to give a range of values for p(Cd2+) and p(Zn2+) that covered 5 and 4 log10 units, respectively. A pH-dependent Freundlich model was used to predict Zn2+ and Cd2+ ion activity in soil pore water. Total and radio-labile metal ion concentration in the solid phase was assumed to be adsorbed on the "whole soil," humus, or free iron oxides to provide alternative model formats. The most successful models assumed that solubility was controlled by adsorption on soil humus. Inclusion of ionic strength as a model variable provided small improvements in model fit. Considering competition with Ca2+ and between Zn2+ and Cd2+ produced no apparent improvement in model fit. Surprisingly, there was little difference between the use of total and labile adsorbed metal as a model determinant. However, this may have been due to a strong correlation between metal lability and pH in the data set used. Values of residual standard deviation for the parameterized models using labile metal adsorbed on humus were 0.26 and 0.28 for prediction of p(Cd2+) and p(Zn2+), respectively. Solubility control by pure Zn and Cd minerals was not indicated from saturation indices. However there may have been fixation of metals to non-radio-labile forms in CaCO3 and Caphosphate compounds in the soils in the higher pH range. Independent validation of the Cd model was carried out using an unpublished data set that included measurements of isotopically exchangeable Cd. There was good agreement with the parameterized model. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={It has been assessed the influence of four organic amendments (OA) consisting of two commercial humic amendments (liquid LF and solid SF) from olive-mill wastes, a solid urban waste (SUW), and a sewage sludge (SS) on the sorption properties and leaching potential of simazine and 2,4-D. A sandy soil (TR) and a sandy-clay soil with a relatively high montmorillonite content (A) were treated with the diverse OA. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was extracted from the amendments, the soils, and the amended soils and studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. A humification index (HIX) was calculated from the fluorescence data. Sorption was determined with the batch technique. Spectroscopical studies revealed that the DOM of the LF differs from the other OA by having a very low ability to absorb and to fluoresce and by its very low HIX values, which indicates that the LF contains large amounts of nonhumified material and consists of small molecules. On the other hand, the SF amendment contains the highest amounts of highly humified material and a large number of carboxylic groups. Amended soils sorbed simazine and 2,4-D to a greater extent than the untreated soils, except in the case of simazine sorption in the LF amended soil A, which had a lower simazine sorption than the original soil. The small molecules of DOM in the LF compete with simazine for montmorillonite sorption sites in soil A. This is not the case for 2,4-D, since this herbicide does not sorb on montmorillonite. In the case of the soil TR, with a lower montmorillonite content, there is no competition between simazine and the LF molecules for sorption sites. Soils amended with the highly humified SF were the best sorbents for simazine but not for 2,4-D, which can be attributed to repulsion between negatively charged 2,4-D molecules and COO- groups, which are more abundant in SF.

The amendments included two commercial humic amendments, a solid urban waste residue, and a sewage sludge. The sorption studies were performed using the batch equilibration procedure. Results indicated that the effect of soil organic matter addition on sorption depended not only on the nature of the organic amendment and the pesticide, but also on the soil to which the organic matter was applied. The amended soils sorbed both pesticides to a greater extent that the untreated soils, except for simazine in the sandy-clay soil with a relatively high montmorillonite content amended with the commercial liquid organic amendment. Soils amended with the commercial solid organic amendment were the best sorbents for simazine, but not for 2,4-D, which was attributed to molecular repulsion.},

abstract={An experiment to evaluate the impact of water erosion and cultivation on the soil carbon dynamic and carbon stock in a semiarid area of South-East Spain was carried out. The study was performed under three different land use scenarios: (1) forest; (2) abandoned agricultural field; and (3) non-irrigated olive grove. Experimental erosion plots (in olive grove and forest) and sediment traps (in the abandoned area) were used to determine the carbon pools associated with sediments and runoff after each event occurring between September 2005 and November 2006. Change in land use from forest to cultivated enhanced the risk of erosion (total soil loss in olive cropland seven-fold higher than in the forest area) and reduced the soil carbon stock (in the top 5 cm) by about 50%. Mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC) represented the main C pool in the three study areas although its contribution to soil organic carbon (SOC) was significantly higher in the disturbed areas (78.91 ± 1.81% and 77.29 ± 1.21% for abandoned and olive area, respectively) than in the forest area (66.05 ± 3.11%). In both, the olive and abandoned soils, the reduction in particulate organic carbon (POC) was proportionally greater than the decline in MOC. The higher degree of sediment production in the olive cropland had an important consequence in terms of the carbon losses induced by erosion compared to the abandoned and forest plots. Thus, the total OC lost by erosion in the sediments was around three times higher in the cultivated (5.12 g C m-2) than the forest plot (1.77 g C m-2). The abandoned area displayed similar OC losses as a result of erosion as the forest plot (in the measurement period: 2.07 g C m-2, 0.63 g C m-2 and 0.65 g C m-2 for olive, forest and abandoned area, respectively). MOC represented the highest percentage of contribution to total sediment OC for all the events analysed and in all uses being, in general these values higher in Olive (74-90%) than in the other two areas (55-80%). The organic carbon lost was basically linked to the solid phase in the three land uses, although the contribution of DOC to total carbon loss by erosion varied widely with each event. Data from this study show that the more labile OC fraction (POC) lost in soil in the cultivated area was mainly due to the effect of cultivation (low overall biomass production and residue return together with high C mineralization) rather than to water erosion, given that the major part of the OC lost in sediments was in the form of MOC. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Uptake of hydrophobic organic compounds into organisms is often limited by the diffusive transport through a thin boundary layer. Therefore, a microscale diffusion technique was applied to determine the diffusive mass transfer of 12 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through water, air, surfactant solutions, humic acid solutions, aqueous soil and horse manure extracts, digestive fluid of a deposit-feeding worm, and root exudates from willow plants. In most cases the diffusive mass transfer of PAHs was much higher through the tested media than through water, and the enhancement factors increased with increasing hydrophobicity of the PAHs. The diffusive flux of benzo[a]-pyrene was for instance enhanced 74 times through gut fluid of a deposit-feeding worm when compared to water. These findings demonstrate that a wide variety of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at environmental levels can enhance diffusive mass transfer in various transport scenarios. The diffusive uptake of PAHs into sediment dwelling organisms is particularly efficient within the gut and at direct contract with the sediment matrix. Bioremediation might be enhanced by the addition of auxiliary agents that enhance diffusive mass transfer. Enhanced diffusion needs also to be considered in dynamic transport models and for the operation and calibration of passive sampling techniques. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={This paper aims to investigate the degradation and speciation of EDDS-complexes (SS-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid) in soil following soil washing. The changes in soil solution metal and EDDS concentrations were investigated for three polluted soils. EDDS was degraded after a lag phase of 7-11 days with a half-life of 4.18-5.60 days. No influence of EDDS-speciation on the reaction was observed. The decrease in EDDS resulted in a corresponding decrease in solubilized metals. Changes in EDDS speciation can be related to (1) initial composition of the soil, (2) temporarily anoxic conditions in the soil slurry after soil washing, (3) exchange of EDDS complexes with Cu even in soils without elevated Cu and (4) formation of NiEDDS. Dissolved organic matter is important for metal speciation at low EDDS concentrations. Our results show that even in polluted soils EDDS is degraded from a level of several hundred micromoles to below 1 μM within 50 days. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Past research strongly indicates the importance of amino acids in the N economy of the Arctic tundra, but little is known about the seasonal dynamics of amino acids in tundra soils. We repeatedly sampled soils from tussock, shrub, and wet sedge tundra communities in the summers of 2000 and 2001 and extracted them with water (H2O) and potassium sulfate (K2SO 4) to determine the seasonal dynamics of soil amino acids, ammonium (NH4 +), nitrate (NO3 -), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and phosphate (PO 4 2-). In the H2O extractions mean concentrations of total free amino acids (TFAA) were higher than NH4 + in all soils but shrub. TFAA and NH4 + were highest in wet sedge and tussock soils and lowest in shrub soil. The most predominant amino acids were alanine, arginine, glycine, serine, and threonine. None of the highest amino acids were significantly different than NH4 + in any soil but shrub, in which NH4 + was significantly higher than all of the highest individual amino acids. Mean NO3 - concentrations were not significantly different from mean TFAA and NH4 + concentrations in any soil but tussock, where NO3 - was significantly higher than NH 4 +. In all soils amino acid and NH4 + concentrations dropped to barely detectable levels in the middle of July, suggesting intense competition for N at the height of the growing season. In all soils but tussock, amino acid and NH4 + concentrations rebounded in August as the end of the Arctic growing season approached and plant N demand decreased. This pattern suggests that low N concentrations in tundra soils at the height of the growing season are likely the result of an increase in soil N uptake associated with the peak in plant growth, either directly by roots or indirectly by microbes fueled by increased root C inputs in mid-July. As N availability decreased in July, PO4 2- concentrations in the K2SO4 extractions increased dramatically in all soils but shrub, where there was a comparable increase in PO4 2- later in the growing season. Previous research suggests that these increases in PO4 2- concentrations are due to the mineralization of organic phosphorus by phosphatase enzymes associated with soil microbes and plant roots, and that they may have been caused by an increase in organic P availability. © Springer 2005.},

abstract={Biochar applications to soils can improve soil fertility by increasing the soil's cation exchange capacity (CEC) and nutrient retention. Because biochar amendment may occur with the applications of organic fertilizers, we tested to which extent composting with farmyard manure increases CEC and nutrient content of charcoal and gasification coke. Both types of biochar absorbed leachate generated during the composting process. As a result, the moisture content of gasification coke increased from 0.02 to 0.94 g g-1, and that of charcoal increased from 0.03 to 0.52 g g-1. With the leachate, the chars absorbed organic matter and nutrients, increasing contents of water-extractable organic carbon (gasification coke: from 0.09 to 7.00 g kg-1; charcoal: from 0.03 to 3.52 g kg-1), total soluble nitrogen (gasification coke: from not detected to 705.5 mg kg-1; charcoal: from 3.2 to 377.2 mg kg-1), plant-available phosphorus (gasification coke: from 351 to 635 mg kg-1; charcoal: from 44 to 190 mg kg-1), and plant-available potassium (gasification coke: from 6.0to 15.3 g kg-1; charcoal: from 0.6 to 8.5 g kg-1). The potential CEC increased from 22.4to 88.6 mmolc kg-1 for the gasification coke and from 20.8 to 39.0 mmolc kg-1 for the charcoal. There were little if any changes in the contents and patterns of benzene polycarboxylic acids of the biochars, suggesting that degradation of black carbon during the composting process was negligible. The surface area of the biochars declined during the composting process due to the clogging of micropores by sorbed compost-derived materials. Interactions with composting substrate thus enhance the nutrient loads but alter the surface properties of biochars. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.},

abstract={Hydroxyl radical (•OH) is a highly reactive and unselective oxidant in atmospheric and aquatic systems. Current understanding limits the role of DOM-produced •OH as an oxidant in carbon cycling mainly to sunlit environments where •OH is produced photochemically, but a recent laboratory study proposed a sunlight-independent pathway in which •OH forms during oxidation of reduced aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) and iron. Here we demonstrate this non-photochemical pathway for •OH formation in natural aquatic environments. Across a gradient from dry upland to wet lowland habitats, •OH formation rates increase with increasing concentrations of DOM and reduced iron, with highest •OH formation predicted at oxic-anoxic boundaries in soil and surface waters. Comparison of measured vs expected electron release from reduced moieties suggests that both DOM and iron contribute to •OH formation. At landscape scales, abiotic DOM oxidation by this dark •OH pathway may be as important to carbon cycling as bacterial oxidation of DOM in arctic surface waters. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Partitioning of organic pollutants is essential to their fate, mobility and removal from water and soil. To study the partitioning behavior of selected alkylphenols, bisphenol A, phthalates and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a method for separating the truly dissolved and colloidal phase of organic pollutants was developed, verified and applied to samples of landfill leachate and stormwater from urban areas and waste-sorting sites.Alkylphenols, bisphenol A, phthalates and PAHs were detected in all the untreated samples (total concentrations), most of the filtered samples and frequently in the colloid-bound phase. Concentrations of alkylphenols and PAHs in urban stormwater were one order of magnitude lower than in the landfill leachates and stormwater from waste-sorting sites.The difference between total, dissolved and colloid-bound concentrations in the water samples was not statistically significant for any phenols or phthalates, but for three of the PAHs; naphthalene (mostly dissolved), phenanthrene and fluoranthene (mostly particulate). These results indicate that in landfill leachates and stormwaters, organic pollutants are predominantly attached to colloids and/or truly dissolved in contrast to their expected strong sorption to particulate matter. Occurrence and concentrations of pollutants in dissolved and colloid-bound phases correlated negatively with the KOW. However, even highly hydrophobic compounds were frequently detected in filtered samples, i.e. the dissolved phases, and it is suggested that the organic content in the colloids decreases the compounds' partition to particles. The results confirm that the KOW values of specific organic pollutants well describe the compounds partition-binding process to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) colloids. Our findings call for a re-assessment of the organic pollutants' mobility and associated risks. This knowledge can also serve as a base for selecting efficient treatment methods for stormwater and landfill leachates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Rates of sulfate reduction and the cycling of sulfur were measured in estuarine sediments vegetated with Zostera marina L. (eelgrass), and in adjacent bare sediment, in summer during the intensive period of the growth season. Sulfate reduction rates were determined along a shoot density gradient (210 to 1026 shoots m-2). There was a positive linear correlation between shoot density and depth-integrated sulfate reduction rates, and rates were 5-fold higher at the dense station (59.1 mmol m-2 d-1) than at the bare site (12.2 mmol m-2 d-1). The accumulation of particulate organic matter was low in the vegetated sediments, and there was no correlation between the organic content and microbial activity. The accumulation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was higher in the vegetated sediments, whereas pools of short chain fatty acids were low (&lt;5 μM) at all stations. There was a positive relationship between the depth-integrated DOC pool and sulfate reduction rates along the shoot density gradient, indicating a direct plant effect probably from a production of labile organic matter within the eelgrass bed. Sulfate reduction rates were primarily enhanced in the rooted zone. The cycling of sulfur compounds was rapid, as there was an accumulation of dissolved sulfides in the pore waters throughout the examined sediment layer (0 to 8 cm) in the vegetated sediments Burial of precipitated reduced sulfides increased with increasing shoot density, but the pools were low when related to the sulfate reduction rates, indicating a rapid reoxidation of sulfides at the location.},

While S biogeochemical cycling has been studied intensively in many environmental settings, relatively little direct information exists on S cycling in formerly drained wetlands that have been remediated via tidal re-flooding. This study focuses on a tidal wetland that was drained in the 1970s (causing severe soil and water acidification), and subsequently remediated by controlled re-flooding in 2002. We examine SO42- reduction rates and Fe-S mineralization at the tidal fringe, 7years after the commencement of re-flooding. The initial drainage of the wetland examined here caused in-situ pyrite (FeS2) oxidation, resulting in the drained soil layers being highly acidic and rich in SO42--bearing Fe(III) minerals, including jarosite (KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6). Tidal re-flooding has neutralized much of the previous acidity, with the pore-water pH now mostly spanning pH 5-7. The fastest rates of in-situ SO42- reduction (up to ~300nmolcm-3day-1) occur within the inter-tidal zone in the near-surface soil layers (to ~60cm below ground surface). The SO42- reduction rates correlate with pore-water dissolved organic C concentrations, thereby suggesting that electron donor supply was the predominant rate determining factor. Elemental S was a major short-term product of SO42- reduction, comprising up to 69% of reduced inorganic S in the near-surface soil layers. This enrichment in elemental S can be partly attributed to interactions between biogenic H2S and jarosite - a process that also contributed to enrichment in pore-water Fe2+ (up to 55mM) and SO42- (up to 50mM). The iron sulfide thiospinel, greigite (Fe3S4), was abundant in near-surface soil layers within the inter- to sub-tidal zone where tidal water level fluctuations created oscillatory redox conditions. There was evidence for relatively rapid pyrite re-formation within the re-flooded soil layers. However, the results indicate that pyrite re-formation has occurred mainly in the lower formerly drained soil layers, whereas the accumulation of elemental S and greigite has been confined towards the soil surface. The discovery that pyrite formation was spatially decoupled from that of elemental S and greigite challenges the concept that greigite is an essential precursor required for sedimentary pyrite formation. In fact, the results suggest that greigite and pyrite may represent distinct end-points of divergent Fe-S mineralization pathways. Overall, this study highlights novel aspects of Fe-S mineralization within tidal wetlands that have been drained and re-flooded, in contrast to normal, undisturbed tidal wetlands. As such, the long-term biogeochemical trajectory of drained and acidified wetlands that are remediated by tidal re-flooding cannot be predicted from the well-studied behaviour of normal tidal wetlands. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={It is crucial to advance the understanding of the soil carbon dioxide (CO2) flux and environmental factors for a better comprehension of carbon dynamics in subtropical ecosystems. Red soil, one of the typical agricultural soils in subtropical China, plays important roles in the global carbon budget due to their large potential to sequester C and replenish atmospheric C through soil CO2 flux. We examined the relationship between soil CO2 flux and environmental determinants in four different land use types of subtropical red soil-paddy (P), orchard (O), woodland (W) and upland (U) using static closed chamber method. Objectives were to evaluate the relationship of soil temperature, water-filled pore space (WFPS), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with the soil CO2 flux. Soil CO2 fluxes were measured on each site about every 14 days between 09:00 and 11:00 a.m. during 14-July 2004 to 25-April 2007 at the experimental station of Heshengqiao at Xianning, Hubei, China. Soil CO2 fluxes revealed seasonal fluctuations, with the tendency that maximum values occurred in summer, minimum in winter and intermediate values in spring and autumn except for paddy soil when it was submerged. Further, significant differences in soil CO2 fluxes were observed among the four soils, following the order of P &gt; O &gt; U ∼ W. Average soil CO2 fluxes were estimated as 901 ± 114, 727 ± 55, 554 ± 22 and 533 ± 27 (±S.D.) g CO2 m-2 year-1 in paddy, orchard, upland and woodland soils, respectively. Variations in soil CO2 flux were related to soil temperature, WFPS, and dissolved organic carbon with a combined R2 of 0.49-0.75. Soil temperature was an important variable controlling 26-59% of soil CO2 flux variability. The interaction of soil temperature and WFPS could explain 31-60% of soil CO2 flux variations for all the land use types. We conclude that soil CO2 flux from red soil is under environmental controls, soil temperature being the main variable, which interact with WFPS and DOC to control the supply of readily mineralizable substrates. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Peatlands export more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than any other biome, contributing 20% of all terrestrial DOC exported to the oceans. Both warming and elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2) can increase DOC exports, but their interaction is poorly understood. Peat monoliths were, therefore, exposed to eCO2, warming and eCO2 + warming (combined). The combined treatment produced a synergistic (i.e., significant interaction) rise in DOC concentrations available for export (119% higher than the control, interaction P &lt; 0.05) and enriched this pool with phenolic compounds (284%). We attribute this to increased plant inputs, coupled with impaired microbial degradation induced by competition with the vegetation for nutrients and inhibitory phenolics. Root biomass showed a synergistic increase (407% relative to the control, P &lt; 0.1 only), while exudate inputs increased additively. Phenol oxidase was suppressed synergistically (58%, interaction P &lt; 0.1 only) and β-glucosidase (27%) additively, while microbial nutritional stress increased (51%) additively. Such results suggest intensified carbon exports from peatlands, with potentially widespread ramifications for aquatic processes in the receiving waters. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Colloid release and deposition in soils and sorption of inorganic and organic pollutants to soil colloids are strongly influenced by the composition and chemical heterogeneity of colloidal soil particles. To investigate the chemical heterogeneity of organic soil colloids at the particle scale, we used synchrotron scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and C-1s near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy on 49 individual particles isolated from the surface horizons of three forest soils. Stacks of 130 images of each particle were collected at different X-ray energies between 280 and 310 eV. From these image arrays, NEXAFS spectra were obtained for each pixel and analyzed by principle component analysis and cluster analysis (PCA-CA) to characterize the intraparticle heterogeneity of the organic components. The results demonstrate that the organic matter associated with water-dispersible soil colloids is chemically heterogeneous at the single-particle scale. PCA-CA identified at least two distinct regions within single particles. However, the spectral variations between these regions were much smaller than the variations of averaged NEXAFS spectra representing different particles from the same soil horizon, implying that interparticle heterogeneity is much larger than intraparticle heterogeneity. Especially the contents of aromatic and carboxyl carbon exhibited a large variability. Overall, the NEXAFS spectra of water-dispersible soil colloids were similar to the NEXAFS spectrum of the humic acid fraction, but differed clearly from the fulvic acid and dissolved organic matter fractions extracted from the same soil horizon using conventional techniques. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Carbon stable isotopic composition was determined for zooplankton, POM, DOM and, in two cases, phytoplankton from 12 small forest lakes in southern Finland during summer 1997. The lakes were selected to provide a wide range of water colour (12-365 mg Pt l-1) but minimum variability in other limnological characteristics. POM and DOM showed similar stable isotope ratios (δ13C around - 28‰ comparable with values commonly reported for terrestrial C3 vegetation) and these showed no relationship to water colour. Zooplankton were consistently depleted in 13C relative to the bulk POM on which they might feed. This relative 13C depletion increased significantly with water colour. Therefore the zooplankton must have been feeding selectively on isotopically light food sources and doing so to a greater extent in the more humic lakes. Although phytoplankton were 13C-depleted relative to POM, their abundance and their variability between lakes did not appear to explain adequately the observed trend in zooplankton stable isotope ratios. We propose that some zooplankton were grazing on methanotrophic bacteria which utilise isotopically light methane derived from allochthonous organic matter decomposed under anaerobic conditions. This process would be more pronounced in coloured lakes with a higher loading of allochthonous organic matter and greater development of hypolimnetic anoxia.},

abstract={The molecular weight distribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore waters from estuarine and continental margin sediments was examined using ultrafiltration techniques. The majority of this pore water DOC (~ 60-90%) had a molecular weight less than 3 kDa. This percentage appeared to vary systematically among the different sediments studied and showed very slight changes with depth (upper ~ 30 cm). The absolute concentration of this low molecular weight DOC (LMW-DOC) increased, along with total DOC, with depth in the sediments. LMW-DOC therefore represents the vast majority of the DOC that accumulated with depth in these sediment pore waters. These results have been examined in the context of a model which assumes that remineralization processes exert the primary influence on the molecular weight distribution of DOC in the upper portions of the sediments. This model, in conjunction, with other recent studies of DOC in sediment pore waters and in the water column, suggests that there was preferential accumulation of refractory LMW-DOC in sediment pore waters. Abiotic condensation reactions (i.e., geopolymerization) appear to have secondary effects on the observed molecular weight distributions of pore water DOC, at least in the upper portions of the sediments examined here. Using this model to explain differences in the molecular weight distributions in these sediments suggests that organic matter remineralization in continental margin sediments may be controlled more by hydrolytic processes than it is in estuarine sediments, where fermentative or perhaps respiratory processes may exert a greater overall control on carbon remineralization. These observations provide further evidence that the extracellular hydrolysis of macromolecular (i.e., high molecular weight) organic matter may not always be the rate limiting step in organic matter degradation.},

abstract={We measured microbial N transformations in 15 cm diam. by 40 cm intact horizontal sections of aquifer material (mesocosms), taken from a riparian forest in Rhode Island, USA, incubated under ambient conditions. The mesocosms allowed us to measure these transformations on the same scale as hydrologic tracer methods (Br-/NO3/- ratios) that measure net NO3/- removal. Our objective was to reconcile discrepancies between hydrologic tracer and microbial measurements in previous studies where laboratory-based microbial NO3/- consumption measurements were much lower than in situ hydrologic measurements of net NO3/- removal. We hypothesized that small 'patches' of organic matter in the aquifer matrix, which are easily missed when sampling for microbial measurements, are 'hotspots' of NO3/- removal and are responsible for these discrepancies. Mesocosms were subjected to three treatments [Br- only, Br- + 15NO3/-, Br- + 15NO3/- + dissolved organic carbon (DOC)]. Solution (NH4/-, NO3/-, dissolved organic N) and gaseous (N2O, 15N2O, and 15N2) inputs and outputs to the mesocosms were measured over a 132-d incubation, followed by destructive sampling for the presence of patches and residual 15N in aquifer matrix and patch material. Total (gross) NO3/- consumption by denitrification and immobilization was greater than net removal of NO3/- measured by Br- /NO3/- ratios. Net NO3/- consumption was only observed in mesocosms that contained 'patches' of organic matter and was not increased by addition of DOC, suggesting that these patches, which represent &lt;1% of aquifer weight, are critical to groundwater NO3/- removal in riparian forests.

abstract={Due to the widespread contamination of groundwater resources with arsenic (As), controls on As mobility have to be identified. In this study we focused on the distribution of As in the dissolved, colloidal and particulate size fraction of experimental solutions rich in ferric iron, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and As(V). Size fractions between &lt;5 kDa and &gt;0.2 μm were separated by filtration and their elemental composition was analyzed. A steady-state particle size distribution with stable element concentration in the different size classes was attained within 24 h. The presence of DOM partly inhibited the formation of large Fe-(oxy)hydroxide aggregates, thus stabilized Fe in complexed and colloidal form, when initially adjusted molar Fe/C ratios in solution were &lt;0.1. Dissolved As concentrations and the quantity of As bound to colloids (&lt;0.2 μm) increased in the presence of DOM as well. At intermediate Fe/C ratios of 0.02-0.1, a strong correlation between As and Fe concentration occurred in all size fractions (R2 = 0.989). At Fe/C ratios &lt;0.02, As was mainly present in the dissolved size fraction. These observations indicate that As mobility increased in the presence of DOM due to (I) competition between As and organic molecules for sorption sites on Fe particles; and (II) due to a higher amount of As bound to more abundant Fe colloids or complexes &lt;0.2 μm in size. The amount of As contained in the colloidal size fractions also depended strongly on the initial size of the humic substance, which was larger for purified humic acids than for natural river or soil porewater samples. Arsenic in the particle size fraction &gt;0.2 μm additionally decreased in the order of pH 4 ≫ 6 &gt; 8. The presence of DOM likely increases the mobility of As in iron rich waters undergoing oxidation, a finding that has to be considered in the investigation of organic-rich terrestrial and aquatic environments. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Groundwater discharge areas in boreal forest ecosystems can potentially be areas where Fe and Al accumulate in the forest floor and affect the solubility of P. This study was conducted to determine phosphate sorption properties using humus soils containing high native amounts of Al and Fe. Humus soils were collected from two different forested groundwater discharge areas varying in pH and amount and distribution of Al and Fe species. The phosphate sorption capacities were 265 and 216 mmol P kg-1 dry wt. soil, respectively, for the two humus soils. Pyrophosphate extractable Al and Fe dominated in the first soil, 738 mmol kg-1 dry wt. The concentration of pyrophosphate extractable Al and Fe in the second soil was 317 mmol kg-1 dry wt., whereas citrate-dithionite (CD) extracted 548 mmol Al and Fe kg-1 dry wt. Using 0.1 mol dm-3 NaCl as ionic medium gave a higher phosphate sorption compared with deionized water at the midrange additions, but no difference at the highest addition. Phosphate sorption was pH independent when 0.1 mol dm-3 NaCl was used, whereas deionized water gave a sorption minimum at approximately pH 6. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release in solution was positively correlated with phosphate sorption, especially in 0.1 mol dm-3 NaCl ionic medium. However, dissolved organic P (DOP) was unaffected by the phosphate sorption. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) indicated that precipitation of Al and Fe phosphates dominated at higher phosphate additions in the soil with mainly organically bound Al and Fe, whereas both surface sorption and precipitation occurs in the soil with a larger amount of CD-extractable Fe.},

abstract={Particulates (ashes) arising from the burning of crop residues are potentially effective adsorbents for pesticides in agricultural soils. To determine the long-term adsorptive sustainability of ashes, a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ash was aged under environmentally relevant conditions (in CaCl2 solution at room temperature and pH 7) in soil extract for 1 month and in a soil (1% ash) for a period of up to 12 months. The aged ash and ash-amended soil were used to sorb diuron from water. The diuron sorption was also measured in the presence of atrazine as a competing pesticide. There was no observed microbial impact on the stability of the wheat ash in soil. All isotherms with the ash were nonlinear type-I curves, suggestive of the surface adsorption. On a unit mass basis, the ash in soil extract was 600-10000 times more effective than the soil in sorbing diuron. Adsorption of dissolved soil organic matter (DOM) during aging on the ash surfaces reduced the diuron adsorption by 50-60%. Surface competition from the atrazine adsorption also reduced the ash adsorption of diuron by 10-30%. A total of 55-67% reduction in diuron sorption by the ash-amended soil was observed. Due to its high initial adsorptivity, the ash fraction of the aged ash-amended soil contributed &gt;50% to the total diuron sorption. Thus, the wheat ash aged in the soil remained highly effective in adsorbing diuron. As crop residues are frequently burned in the field, pesticides in agricultural soils may be highly immobilized due to the presence of ashes.},

abstract={In an experiment using ten heavy metal-contaminated soils from six European countries, soil solution was sampled by water displacement before and after the growth of radish. Concentrations of Cd, Zn and other elements in solution (K, Ca, Mg, Mn) generally decreased during plant growth, probably because of uptake by plants and the subsequent redistribution of ions onto soil exchange sites at lower ionic strength. Speciation analysis by a resin exchange method showed that most Cd and Zn in non-rhizosphere solutions was present as Cd2+ and Zn2+, respectively. The proportion of free ions was slightly lower in rhizosphere solutions, mainly due to an increase in dissolved organic carbon during plant growth. Solution pH increased during plant growth, although the bulk soil pH generally remained constant. Cd concentrations in leaves and tubers were more closely correlated with their total or free ionic concentrations in rhizosphere solutions (adjusted R2 ≤ 0.90) than with their concentrations in soils (adj. R2 ≤ 0.79). Cd concentrations in non-rhizosphere solutions were only poorly correlated with Cd concentrations in leaves and tubers. In contrast to Cd, there were no soil parameters that individually predicted Zn concentrations in leaves and tubers closely. However, multiple correlation analysis (including Zn concentrations in rhizosphere solutions and in bulk soils) closely predicted Zn concentrations in leaves and tubers (adj. R2 = 0.85 and 0.70, respectively). This suggests that the great variability among soils in the solubility of Zn affected the rate of release of Zn into solution, and thus Zn uptake. There was no such effect for Cd, for which solubility varied much less. Furthermore, the plants may have partly controlled Zn uptake, as they took up relatively less at high solution concentrations of Zn. Free ionic concentrations in soil solution did not predict concentrations of Cd or Zn in plants better than their total concentrations in solution. This suggests that with these soils, analysis of Cd and Zn speciation is of little practical importance when their bioavailability is assessed.},

abstract={A comprehensive biogeochemistry model, DNDC, was revised to simulate crop growth and soil processes more explicitly and improve its ability to estimate methane (CH4) emission from rice paddy fields under a wide range of climatic and agronomic conditions. The revised model simulates rice growth by tracking photosynthesis, respiration, C allocation, tillering, and release of organic C and O2 from roots. For anaerobic soil processes, it quantifies the production of electron donors [H2 and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)] by decomposition and rice root exudation, and simulates CH4 production and other reductive reactions based on the availability of electron donors and acceptors (NO3-, Mn4+, Fe3+, and SO42-). Methane emission through rice is simulated by a diffusion routine based on the conductance of tillers and the CH4 concentration in soil water. The revised DNDC was tested against observations at three rice paddy sites in Japan and China with varying rice residue management and fertilization, and produced estimates consistent with observations for the variation in CH4 emission as a function of residue management. It also successfully predicted the negative effect of (NH4)2SO4 on CH4 emission, which the current model missed. Predicted CH4 emission was highly sensitive to the content of reducible soil Fe3+, which is the dominant electron acceptor in anaerobic soils. The revised DNDC generally gave acceptable predictions of seasonal CH4 emission, but not of daily CH4 fluxes, suggesting the model's immaturity in describing soil heterogeneity or rice cultivar-specific characteristics of CH4 transport. It also overestimated CH4 emission at one site in a year with low temperatures, suggesting uncertainty in root biomass estimates due to the model's failure to consider the temperature dependence of leaf area development. Nevertheless, the revised DNDC explicitly reflects the effects of soil electron donors and acceptors, and can be used to quantitatively estimate CH4 emissions from rice fields under a range of conditions. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) narcosis model for benthic organisms in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminated sediments requires the measurement of 18 parent PAHs and 16 groups of alkyl PAHs ("34" PAHs) in pore water with desired detection limits as low as nanograms per liter. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) with gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/ MS) analysis can achieve such detection limits in small water samples, which greatly reduces the quantity of sediment pore water that has to be collected, shipped, stored, and prepared for analysis. Four sediments that ranged from urban background levels (50 mg/kg total "34" PAHs) to highly contaminated (10 000 mg/kg total PAHs) were used to develop SPME methodology for the "34" PAH determinations with only 1.5 mL of pore water per analysis. Pore water was obtained by centrifuging the wet sediment, and alum flocculation was used to remove colloids. Quantitative calibration was simplified by adding 15 two-to six-ring perdeuterated PAHs as internal standards to the water calibration standards and the pore water samples. Response factors for SPME followed by GC/MS were measured for 22 alkyl PAHs compared to their parent PAHs and used to calibrate for the 18 groups of alkyl PAHs. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranging from 4 to 27 mg/L had no measurable effect on the freely dissolved concentrations of two- and three-ring PAHs. In contrast, 5-80% of the total dissolved four- to six-ring PAHs were associated with the DOC rather than being freely dissolved, corresponding to DOC/water partitioning coefficients (KDOC) with log KDOC values ranging from 4.1 (for fluoranthene) to 5.6 (for benzo[ghi]perylene). However, DOC-associated versus freely dissolved PAHs had no significant effect on the total "34" PAH concentrations or the sum of the "toxic units" (calculated by the EPA protocol), since virtually all (86-99%) of the dissolved PAH concentrations and toxic units were contributed by two- and three-ring PAHs. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Laboratory and in situ experiments were performed in order to evaluate the role of UV radiation on bacterial activity. Particular attention was given to the determination of the role of UV-A and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and different nutrient conditions on the recovery of bacterial activity. Laboratory experiments with nearly natural radiation intensities indicated a 20 to 40% reduction from the initial level of bacterial activity after UV-B exposure for 2 to 4 h. Bacterial activity in freshly collected seawater showed a more pronounced inhibition and faster recovery than bacterial activity in aged, nutrient-depleted seawater. The results of in situ experiments with filtered water (0.8-μm-pore-size filter) and natural surface solar radiation levels agreed with those of the laboratory experiments and revealed that UV-A and PAR are important for the recovery of bacterial activity and result in levels of bacterial activity that are higher than those prior to exposure to full solar radiation. Bacterioplankton exposed to full solar radiation for 3 h and subsequently incubated at different depths within the upper mixed water column showed an increase in bacterial activity with increased depth; the highest bacterial activity was detected at depths of 5.5 to 10.5 m, where the short-wavelength UV-B was already largely attenuated, but enough long wavelength UV-A and short PAR were available to allow recovery. This elevated bacterial activity following exposure to UV-B was attributed to the photolysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) exposed to near-surface radiation and to the rapid recovery of bacteria from UV stress once they were mixed into deeper layers of the upper mixed water column, where they efficiently utilize the photolytically cleaved DOM. It is concluded that studies on the role of UV on the carbon and energy flux through the upper layer of the ocean should take into account the highly dynamic radiation conditions.},

abstract={Decreases in pH and increases in the concentration of Al and NO3- have been observed in surface waters draining acid-sensitive regions in the northeastern U.S. during spring snowmelt. To assess the source of this acidity, we evaluated solute concentrations in snowpack, and in meltwater collected from snow and forest floor lysimeters in the west-central Adirondack Mountains of New York during the spring snowmelt period, 29 March through 15 April 1984. During the initial phase of snowmelt, ions were preferentially leached from the snowpack resulting in elevated concentrations in snowmelt water (e.g. H+ = 140 μeq.l-1; NO42- = 123 μeq.l-1; SO3- = 160 μeq.l-1). Solute concentrations decreased dramatically within a few days of the initial melt (&lt; 50 μeq.l-1). The concentrations of SO42- and NO3- in snowpack and snowmelt water were similar, whereas NO-3 in the forest floor leachate was at least two times the concentration of SO42-. Study results suggest that the forest floor was a sink for snowmelt inputs of alkalinity, and a net source of H+, NO3-, dissolved organic carbon, K+ and Al inputs to the mineral soil. The forest floor was relatively conservative with respect to snowmelt inputs of Ca2+, SO42- and Cl-. These results indicate that mineralization of N, followed by nitrification in the forest floor may be an important process contributing to elevated concentrations of H+ and NO3- in streams during the snowmelt period. © 1987 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

abstract={Photochemical and microbial transformations of DOM were evaluated in headwater streams draining forested and human-modified lands (pasture, cropland, and urban development) by laboratory incubations. Changes in DOC concentrations, DOC isotopic signatures, and DOM fluorescence properties were measured to assess the amounts, sources, ages, and properties of reactive and refractory DOM under the influence of photochemistry and/or bacteria. DOC in streams draining forest-dominated watersheds was more photoreactive than in streams draining mostly human-modified watersheds, possibly due to greater contributions of terrestrial plant-derived DOC and lower amounts of prior light exposure in forested streams. Overall, the percentage of photoreactive DOC in stream waters was best predicted by the relative content of terrestrial fluorophores. The bioreactivity of DOC was similar in forested and human-modified streams, but variations were correlated with temperature and may be further controlled by the diagenetic status of organic matter. Alterations to DOC isotopes and DOM fluorescence properties during photochemical and microbial incubations were similar between forested and human-modified streams and included (1) negligible effects of microbial alteration on DOC isotopes and DOM fluorescence properties, (2) selective removal of 13C-depleted and 14C-enriched DOC under the combined influence of photochemical and microbial processes, and (3) photochemical alteration of DOM resulting in a preferential loss of terrestrial humic fluorescence components relative to microbial fluorescence components. This study provides a unique comparison of DOC reactivity in a regional group of streams draining forested and human-modified watersheds and indicates the importance of land use on the photoreactivity of DOC exported from upstream watersheds. © 2013.

abstract={Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), amino acids, carbohydrates and inorganic nutrients were measured on samples taken in July 1994 at 18 stations between Yakutsk and the Lena delta, East Siberia. There were no obvious gradients or features along the river, except in the tributaries, the Aldan and Vilyuy rivers, where significantly higher concentrations of several parameters were measured. Concentrations of DOC varied between 300 and 1000 μM C, with most values varying between 500 and 700 μM C (mean 570 μM C). DON concentrations ranged between 9 and 28 μM N (mean 13 μM N). The C/N ratios of bulk dissolved organic matter (DOM) varied from 30 to 58, with 75% of the values being between 45 and 55 (mean 48). Total dissolved amino acids (TDAA) ranged between 1.6 and 5.4 μM, averaged about 3.5 μM, mostly in the combined form, and represented about 28% of the DON. Free amino acids were only about 2% of TDAA. Glycine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid predominated, accounting for about 41% of TDAA. Total dissolved carbohydrates ranged from 190 to 470 μg glucose equivalents l-1 and averaged 299 μg l-1, forming only 1.2 to 2.5% of the DOC pool. The following ranges of inorganic nutrients were measured: nitrate, 0.01 to 1.4 μM N (mean 0.6 μM N); nitrite, 0.03 to 0.1 μM N (mean 0.07 μM N); ammonium, 0.01 to 0.3 μM N (mean 0.13 μM N); phosphate, 0.2 to 1 μM P (mean 0.5 μMP); silicate, 59 to 87 μM Si (mean 66 μM Si). Carbon isotope data of the suspended organic material suggest that the low inorganic nitrogen values are not due to algal uptake, but rather an inherent characteristic of the river and the catchment area. This, together with positive correlations between silicate, DOC and DON and high C/N values, suggests that the composition of DOM in the Lena River is mainly determined by the input of soil-derived, recalcitrant material and not by autochthonous sources.},

abstract={Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a complex mixture of naturally occurring acyclic and cyclic aliphatic carboxylic acids in petroleum. In the Athabasca oil sands, NAs have been identified as the largest component of dissolved organic matter in the tailings waters from oils sands extraction processes. They are the major contributor to the acute toxicity of the fine tailings wastewaters at the oil sands extraction plants in northeastern Alberta, Canada. In this study, three sources of NAs were studied, including commercially available NAs, those extracted from oil sands process-affected waters, and individual naphthenic-like surrogate compounds. Analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated differences between the commercial and extracted NAs. The NAs derived from the process-affected waters showed a short-term inhibition of methanogenesis from H2 or acetate, but with time the populations resumed methane production. It has been postulated that microbial metabolism of the carboxylated side chains of NAs would lead to methane production. The two NA mixtures failed to stimulate methanogenesis in microcosms that contained either oil sands fine tailings or domestic sewage sludge. However, in microcosms with sewage sludge, methanogenesis was stimulated by some surrogate NAs including 3-cyclohexylpropanoic acid at 400-800mg/L, 5-cyclohexylpentanoic acid at 200mg/L or 6-phenylhexanoic acid at 200 and 400mg/L. When added at 200mg/L to methanogenic microcosms containing fine tailings, 3-cyclohexylpropanoic and 4-cyclohexylbutanoic acids produced methane yields that suggested mineralization of the side chain and the ring.

abstract={Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the soil solution or groundwater can have a considerable effect on the dissipation of hydrophobic organic pollutants. We used the fluorescence quenching technique as well as the reversed-phase separation technique to determine the partition coefficient of 3- to 5-ring PAH to dissolved organic matter from agricultural soils and forest floor materials. Several techniques (centrifugation,pressure filtration, and percolation) are compared for obtaining DOM solution most representative of the DOM in the natural soil solution to use for the sorption experiments. Centrifugation was shown to be the most suitable procedure to obtain DOM solutions in large quantities with a composition most similar to the field soil solution. PAH binding to DOM from mineral soil was found to be considerably lower compared to DOM from acid forest floor materials. These differences can partly be explained by compositional differences with respect to hydrophobic and hydrophilic components of DOM. Binding capacity of DOM was only slightly affected by changes in pH and electrical conductivity of the soil solution. The partition coefficients for DOM from soils are rather different to the data given for model DOM solutions, such as humic acids, fulvic acids, or Aldrich humic acid. To obtain realistic estimates for the effect of DOM on the mobility of hydrophobic organic chemicals in soils, it is essential to use DOM solutions representative of the dissolved organic matter in the soil solution.},

abstract={The Yenisei river passes every type of permafrost regime, from south to north, being characterized by increasing continuity of the permafrost and by decreasing thickness of the active layer. We used that situation to test the hypothesis that amounts and properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in small streams draining forested catchments respond to different permafrost regimes. Water samples were taken from eight tributaries along the Yenisei between 67°30′N and 65°49′N latitude. The samples were analysed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) and DOM was characterized by its chemical composition (XAD-8 fractionation, sugars, lignin phenols, amino acids, protein, UV and fluorescence spectroscopy), and its biodegradability. Most properties of the tributary waters varied depending on latitude. The higher the latitude, the higher were DOC, DON and the proportion of the hydrophobic fraction of DOC. The contribution of hexoses and pentoses to DOC were higher in southern tributaries; on the other hand, phenolic compounds were more abundant in northern tributaries. Mineralizable DOC ranged between 4% and 28% of total DOC. DOM in northern tributaries was significantly (P<0.05) less biodegradable than that in southern tributaries reflecting the differences in the chemical properties of DOM. Our results suggest that the differences in DOM properties are mainly attributed to differences of permafrost regime, affecting depth of active layer, soil organic matter accumulation and vegetation. Soil organic matter and vegetation determine the amount and composition of DOM produced in the catchments while the depth of the active layer likely controls the quantity and quality of DOM exported to streams. Sorptive interactions of DOM with the soil mineral phase typically increase with depth. The results imply that a northern shift of discontinuous permafrost likely will change in the long term the input of DOM into the Yenisei and thus probably into the Kara Sea. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Effects of clear-cutting on the dissolved fluxes of organic C (DOC), organic N (DON), NO3- and NH4+ through surface soil horizons were studied in a Norway spruce dominated mixed boreal forest in eastern Finland. Bulk deposition, total throughfall and soil water from below the organic (including understorey vegetation and, after clear-cutting, also logging residues), eluvial and illuvial horizons were sampled weekly from 1993 to 1999. Clear-cutting was carried out in September 1996. The removal of the tree canopy decreased the deposition of DOC and DON to the forest floor and increased that of NH4+ and NO3- but did not affect the deposition of total N (DTN, &lt;3 kg ha-1 a-1). The leaching of DOC and DON from the organic horizon increased over twofold after clear-cutting (fluxes were on an average 168 kg C and 3.3 kg N ha-1 a-1), but the increased outputs were effectively retained in the surface mineral soil horizons. Inorganic N deposition was mainly retained by the logging residues and organic horizon indicating microbial immobilization. Increased NO3- formation reflected as elevated concentrations in the percolate from below the mineral soil horizons were observed especially in the third year after clear-cutting. However, the changes were small and the increased leaching of DTN from below the illuvial horizon remained small (&lt;0.4 kg ha-1 a-1) and mainly DON. Effects of clear-cutting on the transport of C and N to surface waters will probably be negligible.},

abstract={This study addresses organic matter decomposition in permeable sediment of a sloping intertidal sand flat (German Wadden Sea) affected by current-induced pore water exchange and pore fluid drainage. Seasonal and spatial scales of aerobic and anaerobic mineralization were investigated at 2 sites, one near the water line and one on the upper flat. Hydrodynamic forcing during inundation caused deeper oxygen penetration through flushing of the uppermost sediment layer. This flushing resulted in higher areal oxygen consumption rates and lower depth integrated sulfate reduction rates in the submerged flat compared to the rates measured during exposure. Mineralization rates in the top 15 cm of the sediment were similar between both study sites and ranged from 38 (winter) to 280 mmol C m-2 d-1 (summer), with sulfate reduction contributing 3 to 25 % to total mineralization, depending on the season. At the upper flat, these seasonal differences were reflected in the pore water concentrations of nutrients, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Near the low water line, however, pore water nutrient and DIC concentrations were independent of the season and up to 15 times higher compared to the values recorded in the upper flat. The differences in concentrations of metabolic products between the 2 sites resulted from a low tide drainage extending deep below the uppermost flushed layer and causing seepage of pore water near the low water line. Mineralization and nutrient release in these permeable intertidal sediments is affected by 2 circulation processes that work on distinctly different temporal and spatial scales: (1) rapid 'skin circulation' through the uppermost sediment layer during inundation that is characterized by short flow paths, low pore water residence time and immediate feedback to the ecosystem, and (2) slow 'body circulation' through deeper sediment layers during low tide that is characterized by long flow paths and pore water residence times, and acts as a buffered nutrient source to the ecosystem. © Inter-Research 2006.},

abstract={Labile fractions of organic matter can respond rapidly to changes in C supply and are considered to be important indicators of soil quality. However, much less is known on the impact of different land use systems and depth on labile organic matter fractions. The objective of this study was to estimate land use effects on a distribution of labile fraction organic C through soil profiles in the Sanjiang Plain of northeast China. Four land-use types were selected: Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland, upland forest, two farmlands (cultivated 9 and 15 yr, respectively) of soils previously under Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland, and abandoned cultivated soil. Soil total organic C (TOC), dissolved organic C, microbial organic C, and hot water-extractable C were measured. The results showed that the intact Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland soil had significantly higher labile fraction organic C contents in the topsoil when compared with upland forest, abandoned cultivated, and cultivated soils. However, there were no significant subsoil differences at all sites. The effects of land use on labile fraction organic C occurred mainly in the topsoil (0-20 cm). The labile fraction organic C contents decreased significantly with increasing soil depth in the intact Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland. However, the upland forest, abandoned cultivated, and cultivated soils showed a considerably smaller decrease in labile fraction organic C contents with increasing soil depth. The proportion of dissolved organic C, hot water-extractable C, and microbial biomass C to TOC increased to a maximum at a depth of about 20 to 30 cm, and then decreased with increasing soil depth in the Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland but not the other land use types. © Soil Science Society of America.},

abstract={A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using biosolids and Lolium perenne for the phytostabilization of copper mine tailings and to evaluate the patterns of metal accumulation and translocation in plants. Biosolids were applied either on the surface or mixed with the tailings at rates of 0, 6, and 12% w/w. All pots were seeded with L. perenne and after six months, the plants were harvested and separated into roots and shoots for metal concentrations analyses as well as some physiological characteristics of the plants. In order to correlate the metal content in plant tissues with some chemical properties, the pore-water of the substrates was analyzed for metals, pH and dissolved organic carbon. Results showed that biosolids application increased the dry biomass production of L. perenne and the shoot concentrations of N and chlorophyll. On the other hand, biosolids increased the concentration of Cu and Zn in the pore-water and in plant tissues. Despite this, there were no evident symptoms of phytotoxicity and the concentration of metals was within the normal ranges described for plants and below the maximum tolerable level for animals. In addition, plant tissue analysis showed that the application of biosolids could significantly reduce Mo uptake and shoot accumulation in plants. The metals were taken up by plants in the following order: Cu > Zn > Mo > Cd. The distribution patterns of metals in plants showed that metals were mainly accumulated in the roots and only a small amount of them were transported to the shoots. These results suggest that mixed application of biosolids (6%) and the use of L. perenne could be appropriate for use in programs of phytostabilization of copper mine tailings. However, these results should be tested under field conditions in order to confirm their efficacy under semi-arid Mediterranean climate conditions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The relative contributions of sources of carbon in soils, such as throughfall, litter, roots, microbial decay products and stable organic fractions, to dissolved organic C are controversial. To identify the origin of dissolved organic C, we made use of a 4-year experiment where spruce and beech, growing on an acidic loam and on a calcareous sand, were exposed to increased CO2 that was depleted in 13C. We traced the new C inputs from trees into dissolved organic C, into water-extractable organic C, and into several particle-size fractions. In addition, we incubated the labelled soils for 1 year and measured the production of dissolved organic C and CO 2 from new and old soil C. In the soil solutions of the topsoil, the dissolved organic C contained only 5-10% new C from the trees. The δ 13C values of dissolved organic C resembled those of C pools smaller than 50 μm, which strongly suggests that the major source of dissolved organic C was humified old C. Apparently, throughfall, fresh litter and roots made only minor contributions to dissolved organic C. Water-extractable organic C contained significantly larger fractions of new C than did the natural dissolved organic C (25-30%). The δ13C values of the water-extractable organic C were closely correlated with those of sand fractions, which consisted of little decomposed organic carbon. The different origin of dissolved and water-extractable organic C was also reflected in a significantly larger molar UV absorptivity and a smaller natural 13C abundance of dissolved organic C. This implies that the sampling method strongly influences the characteristics and sources of dissolved organic C. Incubation of soils showed that new soil C was preferentially respired as CO2 and only a small fraction of new C was leached as dissolved organic C. Our results suggest that dissolved organic C is produced during incomplete decomposition of recalcitrant native C in the soils, whereas easily degradable new components are rapidly consumed by microbes and thus make only a minor contribution to the dissolved C fraction.},

abstract={As Arctic regions warm and frozen soils thaw, the large organic carbon pool stored in permafrost becomes increasingly vulnerable to decomposition or transport. The transfer of newly mobilized carbon to the atmosphere and its potential influence upon climate change will largely depend on the degradability of carbon delivered to aquatic ecosystems. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key regulator of aquatic metabolism, yet knowledge of the mechanistic controls on DOC biodegradability is currently poor due to a scarcity of long-term data sets, limited spatial coverage of available data, and methodological diversity. Here, we performed parallel biodegradable DOC (BDOC) experiments at six Arctic sites (16 experiments) using a standardized incubation protocol to examine the effect of methodological differences commonly used in the literature. We also synthesized results from 14 aquatic and soil leachate BDOC studies from across the circum-arctic permafrost region to examine pan-arctic trends in BDOC. An increasing extent of permafrost across the landscape resulted in higher DOC losses in both soil and aquatic systems. We hypothesize that the unique composition of (yedoma) permafrost-derived DOC combined with limited prior microbial processing due to low soil temperature and relatively short flow path lengths and transport times, contributed to a higher overall terrestrial and freshwater DOC loss. Additionally, we found that the fraction of BDOC decreased moving down the fluvial network in continuous permafrost regions, i.e. from streams to large rivers, suggesting that highly biodegradable DOC is lost in headwater streams. We also observed a seasonal (January-December) decrease in BDOC in large streams and rivers, but saw no apparent change in smaller streams or soil leachates. We attribute this seasonal change to a combination of factors including shifts in carbon source, changing DOC residence time related to increasing thaw-depth, increasing water temperatures later in the summer, as well as decreasing hydrologic connectivity between soils and surface water as the thaw season progresses. Our results suggest that future climate warming-induced shifts of continuous permafrost into discontinuous permafrost regions could affect the degradation potential of thaw-released DOC, the amount of BDOC, as well as its variability throughout the Arctic summer. We lastly recommend a standardized BDOC protocol to facilitate the comparison of future work and improve our knowledge of processing and transport of DOC in a changing Arctic. © 2015 Author(s).},

abstract={Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports from many catchments in Europe and North-America are steadily increasing. Several studies have sought to explain this observation. As possible causes, a decrease in acid rain or sulfate deposition, concomitant reductions in ionic strength and increasing temperatures were identified. DOC often originates from riparian wetlands; but here, despite higher DOC concentrations, ionic strength in pore waters usually exceeds that in surface waters. In the catchment under study, DOC concentrations were synchronous with dissolved iron concentrations in pore and stream water. This study aims at testing the hypothesis that DOC exports are mediated by iron reduction/oxidation cycles. Following the observed hydrographs, &delta;18O of water and DOC fluorescence, the wetlands were identified as the main source of DOC. Antecedent biogeochemical conditions, i.e., water table levels in the wetlands, influenced the discharge patterns of nitrate, iron and DOC during an event. The correlation of DOC with pH was positive in pore waters, but negative in surface waters; it was negative for DOC with sulfate in pore waters, but only weak in surface waters. Though, the positive correlation of DOC with iron was universal for pore and surface water. The decline of DOC and iron concentrations in transition from anoxic wetland pore water to oxic stream water suggests a flocculation of DOC with oxidising iron, leading to a drop in pH in the stream during high DOC fluxes. The pore water did not per se differ in pH. There is, thus, a need to consider processes more thoroughly of DOC mobilisation in wetlands when interpreting DOC exports from catchments. The coupling of DOC with iron fluxes suggested that increased DOC exports could at least, in part, be caused by increasing activities in iron reduction, possibly due to increases in temperature, increasing wetness of riparian wetlands, or by a shift from sulfate dominated to iron reduction dominated biogeochemical regimes. © Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={To examine the mechanisms of carbon mobilization and biodegradation during permafrost thawing and to establish a link between organic carbon (OC) and other chemical and microbiological parameters in forming thermokarst (thaw) lakes, we studied the biogeochemistry of OC and trace elements (TEs) in a chronosequence of small lakes that are being formed due to permafrost thawing in the northern part of western Siberia. Twenty lakes and small ponds of various sizes and ages were sampled for dissolved and colloidal organic carbon, metals and culturable heterotrophic bacterial cell number. We observed a sequence of ecosystems from peat thawing and palsa degradation due to permafrost subsidence in small ponds to large, km-size lakes that are subject to drainage to, finally, the khasyrey (drained lake) formation. There is a systematic evolution of both total dissolved and colloidal concentration of OC and TEs in the lake water along with the chronosequence of lake development that may be directly linked to the microbial mineralization of dissolved organic matter and the liberation of the inorganic components (Fe, Al, and TEs) from the organo-mineral colloids. In this chronosequence of lake development, we observed an apparent decrease in the relative proportion of low molecular weight <1 kDa (1 kDa ∼ 1 nm) OC concentration along with a decrease in the concentration of total dissolved (<0.45 μ4m) OC. This decrease was accompanied by an increase in the small size organic ligands (probably autochthonous exometabolites produced by the phytoplankton) and a simultaneous decrease in the proportion of large-size organic (humic) complexes of allochthonous (soil) origin. This evolution may be due to the activity of heterotrophic bacterioplankton that use allochthonous organic matter and dissolved nutrients originating from peat lixiviation. Most insoluble TEs demonstrate a systematic decrease in concentration during filtration (5 μ4m, 0.45 μ4m) exhibiting a similar pattern among different samples. At the same time, there is an increase in the relative proportion of large size particles over the <1 kDa fraction for most insoluble elements along the chronosequence of lake evolution. TEs are likely to be bound to colloidal OC and coprecipitate with the mineral (Fe, Al) part of the colloids. Upon progressive consumption of dissolved OC by the heterotrophic bacteria, there is liberation of Fe, Al, and insoluble TEs in the water column that may be subjected to coagulation in the form of particles or large-size mineral colloids. © 2011 Author(s).},

abstract={We characterized peat decomposition at the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), Minnesota, USA, to a depth of 2m to ascertain the underlying chemical changes using Fourier transform infrared (FT IR) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy) and related these changes to decomposition proxies C:N ratio, δ13C and δ 15N, bulk density, and water content. FT IR determined that peat humification increased rapidly between 30 and 75cm, indicating a highly reactive intermediate-depth zone consistent with changes in C:N ratio, δ13C and δ15N, bulk density, and water content. Peat decomposition at the MEF, especially in the intermediate-depth zone, is mainly characterized by preferential utilization of O-alkyl-C, carboxyl-C, and other oxygenated functionalities with a concomitant increase in the abundance of alkyl- and nitrogen-containing compounds. Below 75cm, less change was observed but aromatic functionalities and lignin accumulated with depth. Significant correlations with humification indices, identified by FT IR spectroscopy, were found for C:N ratios. Incubation studies at 22C revealed the highest methane production rates, greatest CH4:CO2 production ratios, and significant O-alkyl-C utilization within this 30 and 75cm zone. Oxygen-containing functionalities, especially O-alkyl-C, appear to serve as excellent proxies for soil decomposition rate and should be a sensitive indicator of the response of the solid phase peat to increased temperatures caused by climate change and the field study manipulations that are planned to occur at this site. Radiocarbon signatures of microbial respiration products in deeper pore waters at the MEF resembled the signatures of more modern dissolved organic carbon rather than solid phase peat, indicating that recently photosynthesized organic matter fueled the bulk of subsurface microbial respiration. These results indicate that carbon cycling at depth at the MEF is not isolated from surface processes.

abstract={This study addresses how humic substance (HS) chemical composition and photoreactivity affect bacterial growth, respiration, and growth efficiency (BGE) in lake water. Aqueous solutions of HSs from diverse aquatic environments representing different dissolved organic matter sources (autochthonous and allochthonous) were exposed to artificial solar UV radiation. These solutions were added to lake water passed through a 0.7-μm-pore-size filter (containing grazer-free lake bacteria) followed by dark incubation for 5, 43, and 65 h. For the 5-h incubation, several irradiated HSs inhibited bacterial carbon production (BCP) and this inhibition was highly correlated with H 2O2 photoproduction. The H2O2 decayed in the dark, and after 43 h, nearly all irradiated HSs enhanced BCP (average 39% increase relative to nonirradiated controls, standard error = 7.5%, n = 16). UV exposure of HSs also increased bacterial respiration (by ∼18%, standard error = 5%, n = 4), but less than BCP, resulting in an average increase in BGE of 32% (standard error = 10%, n = 4). Photoenhancement of BCP did not correlate to HS bulk properties (i.e., elemental and chemical composition). However, when the photoenhancement of BCP was normalized to absorbance, several trends with HS origin and extraction method emerged. Absorbance-normalized hydrophilic acid and humic acid samples showed greater enhancement of BCP than hydrophobic acid and fulvic acid samples. Furthermore, absorbance-normalized autochthonous samples showed ∼10-fold greater enhancement of BCP than allochthonous-dominated samples, indicating that the former are more efficient photoproducers of biological substrates.

abstract={The mobility of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in soils can be influenced by the presence of dissolved organic matter. Partition coefficients of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, ranging from 3‐ring to 6‐ring compounds, to water‐soluble soil organic matter (WSSOM) were determined. Partition coefficients were determined for WSSOM obtained from two soils under agricultural use and forest and for commercially available humic acid (Aldrich), taking advantage of a reversed phase (C18) separation method. The WSSOM was characterised with regard to charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties with a dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractionation method. No sorption to WSSOM was found for the tri‐ and tetracyclic PAH, whereas the penta‐ and hexacyclic PAH showed a significant binding to both types of WSSOM and to Aldrich humic acid. The affinity of penta‐ and hexacyclic PAH to WSSOM was considerably lower compared to the affinity to Aldrich humic acid. This is suggested to be due to the lower amount of hydrophobic fractions, c. 30%, in the natural WSSOM as compared to Aldrich humic acid. Effective partition coefficients (Koceff) for the sorption of PAH to bulk soil calculated from KDOC and DOM in the naturally occurring concentration range were only 60–70% of the Koc values in pure water. The impact of DOM on pollutant transport is further influenced by non‐equilibrium behaviour of PAH in soils and by sorption of DOM to the solid‐soil matrix. Several scenarios are described in which the effect of DOM on pollutant transport may become important. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={Biochar derived from wheat straw was added to pig manure in amounts equivalent to 5%, 10%, or 15% (w/w, wet weight). The ratios of NH4+/NO3- and of UV light absorption at a wavelength of 254 nm (SUV254) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) indicated that compost with 10-15% biochar became more mature and more humified within 42 days of composting, and the content of DOC and the concentration of NH4+ in such compost decreased by 37.5-62.0% and 4.0-20.9%, respectively, compared to the corresponding levels in the control. Addition of biochar lowered the pH and increased electrical conductivity by 7.0-37.5% compared to the control and also increased the concentrations of water-soluble nutrients including PO43- (5.6-7.4%), K+ (14.2-58.6%), and Ca2+ (0-12.5%). It is therefore recommended that straw biochar be added to pig manure at 10-15% by weight. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Extracellular phenol oxidases play an important role in the soil carbon cycle. The effects of a field-scale summer drought manipulation on extracellular litter and soil phenol oxidase activity, soluble phenolic compounds and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were examined for an upland Calluna heathland on a peaty podsol in North Wales. Litter and organic soil phenol oxidase activity was found to be positively correlated with moisture content. Thus in shallow organic soils, which are sensitive to drying during periods of low rainfall, drought may inhibit soil phenol oxidase activity as a result of water limitations. The release of soluble phenolic compounds and DOC from the droughted plots was found to be lowered during the drought period and elevated outside of the drought period. It is hypothesized that these changes may be a result of the reduced ability of extracellular phenol oxidases to process recalcitrant polyphenolic material under drought conditions. A drying incubation carried out with litter and soil cores from the same site suggests that extracellular phenol oxidase activity displays an optimal moisture level. This reconciled the observed water limitation of phenol oxidase activity at the heathland experimental site with previously observed stimulation of phenol oxidase activity by water table drawdown in deeper peats. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The objective of this study was to examine chemical changes in porewaters that occur over small scales (cm) as groundwater flows through the hyporheic zone and discharges to a stream in a temperate forest of northern Wisconsin. Hyporheic-zone porewaters were sampled at discrete depths of 2, 10, 15, 61, and 183 cm at three study sites in the study basin. Chemical profiles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, CH4, and pH show dramatic changes between 61 cm sediment depth and the water-sediment interface. Unless discrete samples at small depth intervals are taken, these chemical profiles are not accounted for. Similar trends were observed at the three study locations, despite each site having very different hydraulic-flow regimes. Increases in DOC concentration by an order of magnitude from 61 to 15 cm depth with a corresponding decrease in pH and rapid decreases in the molecular weight of the DOC suggest that aliphatic compounds (likely organic acids) are being generated in the hyporheic zone. Estimated efflux rates of DOC, CO2, and CH4 to the stream are 6.2, 0.79, 0.13 moles m2 d-1, respectively, with the vast majority of these materials produced in the hyporheic zone. Very little of these materials are accounted for by sampling stream water, suggesting rapid uptake and/or volatilization.},

We measured denitrification, immobilization, and respiration in microcosms that simulated groundwater conditions in a riparian forest in Rhode Island. Measured rates were compared with rates of NO3/- removal measured in a companion study using a groundwater monitoring well network and 10-mo injection of NO3/- and a bromide tracer to groundwater in the same riparian forest. Limiting factors for denitrification were assessed, and microbial and root biomass and potential net N mineralization and nitrification were compared in aquifer material exposed to the 10 mo of NO3/- dosing and unexposed control material. While there was significant variation in water table levels, dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic C, and total C within the aquifer in the riparian forest, there was little spatial variation in denitrification or respiration rates. Rates were higher in summer than in winter and were nearly always limited by a lack of organic C. Limited evidence suggested that immobilization was not a significant sink for NO3/-. Measured groundwater denitrification rates were high enough to eliminate 27% of an incoming NO3/- concentration of 10 mg N L-1 over a riparian zone width of 60 m, with a travel time of 1600 d, and equaled 6.0 kg N ha-1 yr-1. The measured denitrification rates were much lower than rates of groundwater NO3/- removal directly measured in the companion hydrologic study at the same time (120 kg N ha-1 yr-1), suggesting that there is still considerable uncertainty about the mechanisms of NO3/- removal from groundwater in riparian forests.},

abstract={Conflicting views on the potential importance of soil water as a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in headwater streams are addressed by comparing organic chemistries of soil waters in the riparian zone with an adjacent stream at an upland site in mid-Wales during one year. DOC, which as a whole is relatively refractory, was contrasted with the labile dissolved free amino acids (DFAAs). DOC distributions in riparian soil waters showed little temporal or spatial consistency, but concentrations almost always exceeded those in the stream (mean = 9.4 and 2.1 mg l-1, respectively). This represents an average carbon input of some 2500 g C m-2 year-1 to the stream, indicating the quantitative importance of DOC in riparian soil waters to stream productivity. Total DFAA concentrations were &lt;0.3% of the DOC measured. Although their mean concentrations were also higher in soil waters (168.2 nmol l-1) than in the stream (113.9 nmol l-1), this was not a consistent trend. Most probably the DFAAs' lability resulted in their almost complete immobilization within the streambed during microporous discharge of catchment runoff through the streambed. Three major hydrological flow paths in the riparian zone were inferred by correlating dynamics of the organic chemistry, as well as inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), between sampling points. A lack of any dynamic relationship between organic concentrations in saturated through-flow of the stream bank and the stream suggested an efficient immobilization of this soil water DOC within the streambed, prior to its discharge into the stream; an immobilization particularly significant at baseflow. Correlations for both DOC and inorganic N between the stream bank unsaturated zone and the stream suggested that, at least at higher flows, this soil water input could directly influence the stream. A high degree of correlation between soil waters of the forest edge (6m from the stream) and the stream suggested that some form of macroporous transfer of soil water from further back in the riparian zone could also directly influence the stream. These results reveal the complexity of the riparian environment. It is concluded that the riparian zone can contribute substantial amounts of DOC to a stream ecosystem, and that the streambed must be a key area of chemical reactivity where much of this material is initially processed. As the delivery of DOC to the streambed will depend on the hydrology of the riparian zone, a knowledge of this is an essential prerequisite to modelling the transfer of organic material from a catchment to a stream. © 1990.},

abstract={SUMMARY.  The development of stone surface organic layers was investigated in dark and light experimental channels at two field sites. Layer formation was monitored by measuring organic carbon, chlorophyll‐a, ATP and rates of oxygen consumption, and using scanning electron microscopy.  In the darkened forest stream channel an organic layer consisting of slime, fine particles, bacteria and fungi developed and attained maximum biomass (=0.08 mg cm‐2) in about 2 months. At the second site, channels were fed by spring water low in dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOC &lt; 0.5 g m‐3) and no organic layer developed on stones in the dark. Organic layers grown in channels subject to natural light intensities and photoperiods were dominated by diatoms and/or filamentous algae at both sites.  Laboratory experiments carried out in enclosed, recirculating stream channels demonstrated the importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a prerequisite for layer formation. Also. DOM additions in the form of leaf leachates stimulated oxygen consumption by preformed layers. Uptake by microorganisms accounted for most of the reduction in water‐column DOM.  Radiotracer experiments (14C and 144Ce) showed that several common stream invertebrates could feed on ‘heterotrophic’ layers. Calculated assimilation efficiencies ranged from 18% to 74% and imply that nonautotrophic components of stone surface organic layers are likely to play a significant role in carbon transfer to the benthos, particularly in small, shaded streams.

abstract={Limited information is available to understand the chemical structure of biochar's labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fraction that will alter soil organic carbon (SOC) composition. This study utilized the high sensitivity of fluorescence excitation-emission (EEM) spectrophotometry to understand the structural changes in biochar-derived DOC as a function of (1) chemical property of feedstock and (2) pyrolysis temperature (350-800 C). Regardless of feedstock (almond shell, broiler litter, lignin, cottonseed hull, and pecan shell), low temperature (350-400 C) pyrolysis shifted EEM of hot water (80 C for 16 h) extracts toward longer emission wavelengths, higher aromaticity regions. Five component parallel factor (PARAFAC) modeling of EEM afforded: (C1) (poly)phenolic pyrolysis products and other water-soluble aromatic structures similar to fulvic-like SOC; (C2-C3) aromatic structures similar to humic-like SOC having low water solubility that decomposed above 350 C; (C4) carboxyl and other transient thermochemical conversion intermediates that decomposed above 500 C; and (C5) thermally stable DOC fraction of lignin-rich biomass (pecan shell and lignin). Relative contribution of fulvic-like component exceeded that of humic-like components, and increased as a function of pyrolysis temperature. The C4 showed disproportionately high contributions to 500 C broiler litter and cottonseed hull biochars. The carboxyl-enriched DOC of biochars pyrolyzed at 350-500 C can have diverse environmental consequences, including the mobilization of heavy metals. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The abundances, compositions, and activities of microbial communities were investigated at bog and fen sites in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatland of northwestern Minnesota. These sites contrast in the reactivity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the presence or absence of groundwater inputs. Microbial community composition was characterized using pyrosequencing and clone library construction of phylogenetic marker genes. Microbial distribution patterns were linked to pH, concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, C/N ratios, optical properties of DOM, and activities of laccase and peroxidase enzymes. Both bacterial and archaeal richness and rRNA gene abundance were>2 times higher on average in the fen than in the bog, in agreement with a higher pH, labile DOM content, and enhanced enzyme activities in the fen. Fungi were equivalent to an average of 1.4% of total prokaryotes in gene abundance assayed by quantitative PCR. Results revealed statistically distinct spatial patterns between bacterial and fungal communities. Fungal distribution did not covary with pH and DOM optical properties and was vertically stratified, with a prevalence of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota near the surface and much higher representation of Zygomycota in the subsurface. In contrast, bacterial community composition largely varied between environments, with the bog dominated by Acidobacteria (61% of total sequences), while the Firmicutes (52%) dominated in the fen. Acetoclastic Methanosarcinales showed a much higher relative abundance in the bog, in contrast to the dominance of diverse hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the fen. This is the first quantitative and compositional analysis of three microbial domains in peatlands and demonstrates that the microbial abundance, diversity, and activity parallel with the pronounced differences in environmental variables between bog and fen sites. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

abstract={A soil column experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of inoculation of bacteria on metal bioavailability, mobility and potential leachability through single chemical extraction, consequential extraction and in situ soil solution extraction technologies. Results showed that bacteria inoculated, including Azotobacter chroococcum, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus mucilaginosus, may pose both positive and negative impacts on bioavailability and mobility of heavy metals in soil, depending on the chemical nature of the metals. The activities of bacteria led to an increase of water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and a decrease of pH value, which enhanced metal mobility and bioavailability (e.g. an increase of water-soluble and HOAc-soluble Zn). On the other hand, bacteria could immobilize metals (e.g. a great reduction of water-soluble Pb) due to the adsorption by bacterial cell walls and possible sedimentation reactions with phosphate or other anions produced through bacterial metabolism. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Northern peatlands store ca. 1/3 of the world's soil organic carbon and this is attributed to low decomposition rates as a result of waterlogged, anaerobic conditions and high levels of phenolic substances. Climate change models predict both an increase in summer droughts and increased rainfall, depending on region, but information on the effect of these changes on the microbial population that mediate phenolic degradation is sparse. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGGE) was therefore used to assess the effect of simulated summer drought and increased rainfall on the diversity of phenolic degrading bacteria in a northern peatland using the gene XylE, encoding for the enzyme Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), as an indicator. Under simulated drought, a greater diversity (129.4%, P&lt;0.05) and abundance of phenolic catabolising bacterial species was found. Concurrent increased total phenol oxidase activities (83.3%) and β-glucosidase activities (157.6%, P&lt;0.01) were found with consistently lower concentrations of phenolic compounds, DOC and increased CO2 fluxes. This increased mineralisation is likely to lower carbon storage capacity and increase climate forcing. Conversely, the increased rainfall simulation suppressed diversity (62.2%, P&lt;0.05), abundance and phenol oxidase activities (103.3%, P&lt;0.001), giving increased phenolic compound (424.8%, P&lt;0.1 only) and DOC concentrations (201.3%, P&lt;0.001), along with increased anaerobic trace gas fluxes. These hugely increased aquatic carbon concentrations available for export are of serious concern due to their deleterious effect on drinking water quality. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Naturally occurring, macromolecular dissolved organic matter (NOM) is known to foul activated carbon adsorbents, reducing the ability of fixed-bed adsorbers to efficiently remove targeted synthetic organic contaminants (SOCs). An accurate description of the effects of NOM competition on SOC adsorption equilibria is required to develop dynamic models, which have application to process design and analysis. A model was developed, using an approach based on the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST), to predict trichloroethylene (TCE) adsorption by activated carbon preloaded with humic acid. The IAST model was formulated for a bisolute system in which TCE and humic acid single-solute uptakes were described by the Langmuir-Freundlich and Freundlich isotherms, respectively. The humic mixture was modeled as a single component based on previous studies that identified the low-molecular- weight hydrophobic fraction as the most reactive with regard to preloading effects. Isotherms for this fraction, isolated from whole humic acid using ultrafiltration, were measured, and molar concentrations were computed based on an average molecular weight determined using size-exclusion chromatography. The IAST model was modified to reflect the hypothesis that TCE molecules can access adsorption sites which humic molecules cannot and that no competition can occur on these sites. The model was calibrated with data for TCE uptake by carbon preloaded with the low-molecular-weight humic acid fraction and was verified by predicting TCE uptake by carbon preloaded with whole humic acid. Further improvement to the model was possible by accounting for pore blockage as a mechanism which can reduce the effective surface area available to TCE.},

abstract={Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurements and optical properties were applied to assess the photo- and bio-reactivity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from different sources, including biomass leaching, soil leaching and surface waters in a subtropical wetland ecosystem. Samples were exposed to light and/or dark incubated through controlled laboratory experiments. Changes in DOC, ultraviolet (UV-Vis) visible absorbance, and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) were performed to assess sample degradation. Degradation experiments showed that while significant amounts of DOC were consumed during bio-incubation for biomass leachates, a higher degree of bio-recalcitrance for soil leachate and particularly surface waters was displayed. Photo- and bio-humification transformations were suggested for sawgrass, mangrove, and seagrass leachates, as compared to substantial photo-degradation and very little to almost no change after bio-incubation for the other samples. During photo-degradation in most cases the EEM-PARAFAC components displayed photo-decay as compared to a few cases which featured photo-production. In contrast during bio-incubation most EEM-PARAFAC components proved to be mostly bio-refractory although some increases and decreases in abundance were also observed. Furthermore, the sequential photo- followed by bio-degradation showed, with some exceptions, a "priming effect" of light exposure on the bio-degradation of DOM, and the combination of these two processes resulted in a DOM composition more similar to that of the natural surface water for the different sub-environments. In addition, for leachate samples there was a general enrichment of one of the EEM-PARAFAC humic-like component (Ex/Em: <260(305)/416nm) during photo-degradation and an enrichment of a microbial humc-like component (Ex/Em: <260(325)/406nm and of a tryptophan-like component (Ex/Em: 300/342nm) during the bio-degradation process. This study exemplifies the effectiveness of optical property and EEM-PARAFAC in the assessment of DOM reactivity and highlights the importance of the coupling of photo- and bio-degradation processes in DOM degradation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Estuaries have been reported to be sinks for hydrophobic pollutants, and sorption has been commonly attributed to be an important mechanism responsible for the observed pollutant trapping. The sorption enhancement caused by 'salt effects' and dissolved organic matter (DOM) coatings were both measured and modeled, and the results were used to probe the extent to which equilibrium sorption could explain estuarine pollutant trapping. The polycyclic aromatic compound phenanthrene, an extracellular polymer from a soil bacterial isolate, and a low organic carbon kaolinite were used as models for the hydrophobic pollutant, DOM, and suspended sediment, respectively. Sorptive interactions between phenanthrene, extracellular polymer, and kaolinite were measured at pH 8 as a function of salinity. The experimentally determined binary distribution coefficients were combined using a three-component sorption model to calculate the overall sorption coefficient for phenanthrene, K0. Increasing the ionic strength to seawater levels increased the overall sorption coefficient by 55% as compared to the freshwater value while the presence of polymer coatings increased K0 by 9% at all salinities. The three-component model simulation of sorption in the estuary showed that only 0.1% of available phenanthrene would be sorbed to suspended sediment given reasonable estimates of the DOM and particulate concentrations. Order of magnitude analyses carried out with other combinations of estuarine DOM and sediments also fell short of levels required to explain observed estuarine pollutant trapping. These experiments and model simulations lead to the conclusion that equilibrium sorption of phenanthrene cannot explain the full extent of pollutant trapping in estuaries.},

abstract={Soil quality is defined as the capacity of the soil to perform multiple functions, and can be assessed by measuring soil chemical, physical and biological parameters. Among soil parameters, labile organic carbon is considered to have a primary role in many soil functions related to productivity and environmental resilience. Our study aimed at assessing the suitability of different labile carbon fractions, namely dissolved organic carbon (DOC), hydrophilic DOC (Hy-DOC), permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC, also referred to as Active Carbon), hot water extractable carbon (HWEC) and particulate organic matter carbon (POMC) as soil quality indicators in agricultural systems. To do so, we tested their sensitivity to two agricultural management factors (tillage and organic matter input) in 10 European long-term field experiments (LTEs), and we assessed the correlation of the different labile carbon fractions with physical, chemical and biological soil quality indicators linked to soil functions. We found that reduced tillage and high organic matter input increase concentrations of labile carbon fractions in soil compared to conventional tillage and low organic matter addition, respectively. POXC and POMC were the most sensitive fractions to both tillage and fertilization across the 10 European LTEs. In addition, POXC was the labile carbon fraction most positively correlated with soil chemical (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and cation exchange capacity), physical (water stable aggregates, water holding capacity, bulk density) and biological soil quality indicators (microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and soil respiration). We conclude that POXC represents a labile carbon fraction sensitive to soil management and that is the most informative about total soil organic matter, nutrients, soil structure, and microbial pools and activity, parameters commonly used as indicators of various soil functions, such as C sequestration, nutrient cycling, soil structure formation and soil as a habitat for biodiversity. Moreover, POXC measurement is relatively cheap, fast and easy. Therefore, we suggest measuring POXC as the labile carbon fraction in soil quality assessment schemes in addition to other valuable soil quality indicators. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Lodgepole pine needle leachates from trees killed by the mountain pine beetle epidemic in Colorado were evaluated for dissolved organic matter (DOM) character, biodegradation, treatability by coagulation and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. An average of 8.0 (±0.62) mg-DOC/g-dry weight of litter was leached from three sets of needle samples representing different levels of forest floor degradation. Fluorescence analysis included collection of excitation and emission matrices, examination of peak intensities and development of a 4-component parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis model. Peak intensity and PARAFAC analyses provided complementary results showing that fresh leachates were initially dominated by polyphenolic/protein-like components (60-70%) and humic-like fluorescence increased (40-70%) after biodegradation. Humic-like components were removed by coagulation (20-64%), while polyphenolic/protein-like components were not, which may create challenges for utilities required to meet OM removal regulations. DBP formation yields after 24 h chlorination were 20.5-26.4 μg/mg-DOC for trihalomethanes and 9.0-14.5 μg/mg-DOC for haloacetic acids for fresh leachates; increased after biodegradation to 19.2-64.2 and 7.1-30.9 μg/mg-DOC, respectively; and decreased after coagulation (fresh: 11.3-17.7;5.7-7.6 μg/mg-DOC, respectively; biodegraded: 12.0-27.3 and 2.9-7.2 μg/mg-DOC, respectively), reflective of changes in concentration of humic material. Humic-like PARAFAC components and peak intensities were positively correlated (R2 ≥ 0.45) to DBP concentrations, while polyphenolic/protein-like components were not (R2 ≥ 0.17). © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Subsurface drainage in agricultural watersheds exports a large quantity of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and concentrations frequently exceed 10 mg L-1. A laboratory column study was conducted to investigate the ability of a wood chip bioreactor to promote denitrification under mean water flow rates of 2.9, 6.6, 8.7 and 13.6 cm d-1 which are representative of flows entering subsurface drainage tiles. Columns were packed with wood chips and inoculated with a small amount of oxidized till and incubated at 10°C. Silicone sampling cells at the effluent ports were used for N2O sampling. 15Nitrate was added to dosing water at 50 mg L-1 and effluent was collected and analyzed for NO3-N, NH4-N, and dissolved organic carbon. Mean NO3-N concentrations in the effluent were 0.0, 18.5, 24.2, and 35.3 mg L-1 for the flow rates 2.9, 6.6, 8.7, and 13.6 cm d-1, respectively, which correspond to 100, 64, 52, and 30% efficiency of removal. The NO3-N removal rates per gram of wood increased with increasing flow rates. Denitrification was found to be the dominant NO3-N removal mechanism as immobilization of 15NO3-N was negligible compared with the quantity of 15NO3-N removed. Nitrous oxide production from the columns ranged from 0.003 to 0.028% of the N denitrified, indicating that complete denitrification generally occurred. Based on these observations, wood chip bioreactors may be successful at removing significant quantities of NO 3-N, and reducing NO3-N concentration from water moving to subsurface drainage at flow rates observed in central Iowa subsoil.

abstract={It has long been assumed that the peat underlying tropical peat swamp forests accumulates because the extreme conditions (water logged, nutrient poor, anaerobic and acidic-pH 2.9-3.5) impede microbial activity. Litterbag studies in a tropical Malaysian peat swamp (North Selangor peat swamp forest) showed that although the sclerophyllous, toxic leaves of endemic peat forest plants (Macaranga pruinosa, Campnosperma coriaceum, Pandanus atrocarpus, Stenochlaena palustris) were barely decomposed by bacteria and fungi (decay rates of only 0.0006-0.0016 k day-1), leaves of M. tanarius, a secondary forest species were almost completely decomposed (decay rates of 0.0047-0.005 k day-1) after 1 year. Thus it is intrinsic properties of the leaves (that are adaptations to deter herbivory in the nutrient poor environment) that impede microbial breakdown. The water of the peat swamp was very high in dissolved organic carbon (70-84 mg l-1 DOC). Laboratory studies revealed initial rapid leaching of DOC from leaves (up to 1,720 mg l -1 from 4 g of leaves in 7 days), but the DOC levels then fell rapidly. The leaching of DOC resulted in weight loss but the physical structure of the leaves remained intact. It is suggested that the DOC is used as a substrate for microbial growth hence lowering the concentration of DOC in the water and transferring energy from the leaves to other trophic levels. This would explain how nutrient poor tropical peatswamps support diverse, abundant flora and fauna despite low nutrient levels and lack of rapid litter cycling such as occurs in other types of tropical rainforests. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Organic matter pools contributing to N mineralization potential have not been adequately defined. We analyzed 61 soil samples (0-15 cm depth) representing all agroecological regions of Saskatchewan, Canada to determine the relationships between mineralization parameters [i.e., potentially mineralizable N (N0) and the rate coefficient k, measured by aerobic incubation at 35°C for 24 wk] and N fractions defined by a series of chemical and physical extraction procedures. Light-fraction (LF) organic matter, isolated by flotation on NaI solution at specific gravity 1.7, soluble organic matter measured in saturated paste extracts, and NH4-N released by two chemical procedures [digestion in 2 M KCl (100°C for 4 h) and steam distillation in phosphate-borate (PB) buffer at pH 11.2] were evaluated as indices of mineralizable N. Nitrogen released by hot KCl represented 2.5 to 16% of N0, which ranged from 71 to 631 mg kg-1. Hot KCl N was poorly correlated with N0 (R2 = 0.13, P &lt; 0.01), but it was reasonably well related to N mineralized in the first 2 wk of incubation (R2 = 0.65, P &lt; 0.001), and to dissolved organic matter (R2 = 0.58, P &lt; 0.001). The value of k, which ranged from 0.025 to 0.18 wk-1, increased as hot KCl N increased as a proportion of N0 (KCl N/N0 accounted for 64% of the variability in k). These results suggest that hot KCl may be selective for the most labile (possibly water-soluble) organic N. Phosphate-borate extracted an average of 3.5 times as much N as hot KCl, but relationships with mineralization parameters were generally similar to those found for hot KCl. Light-fraction N was the largest N pool measured (33-652 mg N kg-1). It was well correlated with N0 (R2 = 0.83, P &lt; 0.001), but not with N mineralized in the early part of the incubation or with k, indicating that LF N mineralizes slowly compared with chemically extracted N. When LF N was added to PB N, there was roughly enough N in the combined pool to account for N0.},

abstract={Mercury and organic carbon concentrations vary dynamically in streamwater at the Sleepers River Research Watershed in Vermont, USA. Total mercury (THg) concentrations ranged from 0.53 to 93.8 ng/L during a 3-year period of study. The highest mercury (Hg) concentrations occurred slightly before peak flows and were associated with the highest organic carbon (OC) concentrations. Dissolved Hg (DHg) was the dominant form in the upland catchments; particulate Hg (PHg) dominated in the lowland catchments. The concentration of hydrophobic acid (HPOA), the major component of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), explained 41-98% of the variability of DHg concentration while DOC flux explained 68-85% of the variability in DHg flux, indicating both quality and quantity of the DOC substantially influenced the transport and fate of DHg. Particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations explained 50% of the PHg variability, indicating that POC is an important transport mechanism for PHg. Despite available sources of DHg and wetlands in the upland catchments, dissolved methylmercury (DmeHg) concentrations in streamwaters were below detection limit (0.04 ng/L). PHg and particulate methylmercury (PmeHg) had a strong positive correlation (r 2 = 0.84, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting a common source; likely in-stream or near-stream POC eroded or re-suspended during spring snowmelt and summer storms. Ratios of PmeHg to THg were low and fairly constant despite an apparent higher methylmercury (meHg) production potential in the summer. Methylmercury production in soils and stream sediments was below detection during snowmelt in April and highest in stream sediments (compared to forest and wetland soils) sampled in July. Using the watershed approach, the correlation of the percent of wetland cover to TmeHg concentrations in streamwater indicates that poorly drained wetland soils are a source of meHg and the relatively high concentrations found in stream surface sediments in July indicate these zones are a meHg sink. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={In arid ecosystems, as much as 75% of solar radiation that penetrates the atmosphere hits the surface of the soil. The combination of high irradiance, high temperature, and low moisture puts constraints on the activity and organization of microbial communities. To separate the direct effects of UV absorbance on litter decomposition from the indirect effects of microbial selection, we placed mixed cohorts of senescent piñon (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) litter into triplicate microcosms assigned to four treatments: UV irradiated (0.6 mW/cm2 UV-A and UV-B for 12 h/day), with and without water additions, and non-irradiated with and without water additions. After 26 weeks, mass loss rates did not differ significantly among treatments with 90% organic matter remaining for piñon litter and 60% for juniper. The distribution and abundance of functional groups as assessed by FTIR spectra did not reveal any differences in relation to treatment, but differences were observed in the quantity and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) extracted from the samples. The amount of DOC extracted increased by 56% for piñon litter and decreased by 32% for juniper in the UV-only treatment compared to initial values. Litter treated with UV and water had the lowest concentration of DOC with a decrease of 69% for juniper litter and 28% for piñon. The largest concentration of reactive phenols was found in the UV-only treatment with a 309% increase for piñon litter and a 10% reduction for juniper when compared to initial values. The treatments receiving water in the presence or absence of UV showed a similar response for both litter types, a reduction of 20-30% in phenolic concentration. Five extracellular enzyme activities, used, as indicators of microbial activity, were higher in the treatments that received water, but activities did not show an interaction with UV irradiation. The results suggest that UV radiation alone, or in combination with microbial activity, was as effective at decomposing litter as microbial activity alone. Thus, solar radiation can be an important contributor to litter degradation in arid systems. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Experiments on the sorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soils were mainly conducted in batch approaches. Because varying setups were used in these studies, comparison of the results requires knowledge on the effects that different experimental conditions may have on the sorption of DOC. This investigation evaluated the DOC sorption of soils using differently pretreated soil samples (field-fresh (two sampling dates), air-dried, stored at 3°C and - 18°C), at different soil-to-solution ratios (1:40, 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 w/v) and different temperatures (5°C, 15°C, 25°C and 35°C). The sorption of DOC was analyzed using the initial mass (IM) approach, which regressed the initial amount of sorbate (normalized to soil mass) against the sorbed amount (normalized to soil mass). The DOC release - when a solution without DOC was added - strongly increased with temperature and soil-to-solution ratio. Among the different types of sample storage and preparation, air-drying resulted in the largest DOC release. The smallest release was from the field-fresh samples. Freezing and storage at 3°C resulted in intermediate DOC release with freezing having the greater effect. The release from air-dried samples exceeded that of field-fresh samples by a factor of four at maximum. In contrast, none of the experimental setups influenced the slope of the IM isotherms. Thus, it seems possible to compare directly the binding affinity of DOC to different soils as determined at varying experimental conditions. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The mobility and bioavailability of lead (Pb) in soils can be mitigated by its immobilization using both soluble and insoluble phosphate (P) compounds. The effectiveness of insoluble P sources on Pb immobilization depends on their rate of dissolution which can be enhanced by phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB). In this study, the effect of soluble (potassium dihydrogen phosphate) and insoluble (rock phosphate in the presence and absence of PSB) P compounds on the immobilization of Pb, and leaching of Pb and P was examined using both naturally contaminated (SR soil: NH4NO3 extractable Pb: 28.7mg/kg, pH: 5.88, organic matter: 0.7%) and Pb spiked (AH soil: NH4NO3 extractable Pb: 42.7mg/kg, pH: 5.23, organic matter: 10.9%) soils. Phosphate compounds were added at the rate of 200mg P/kg and 800mg P/kg for SR and AH soils, respectively. Soluble P treatment immobilized 80% and 57% of Pb in SR and AH soils, respectively. Insoluble rock phosphate immobilized 40% and 9% of Pb without PSB, and 60% and 17% with PSB in SR and AH soils, respectively. Lead leaching was the lowest when soils were amended with rock phosphate in the presence of PSB, which reduced Pb leaching by 36% for SR soil and 18% for AH soil compared to the control. The leaching of Pb increased when the soils were amended with soluble P because soluble P treatment increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of soil, thereby increasing Pb mobility. Soluble P treatment significantly increased P leaching and 9% of total added P was leached from low P retaining AH soil. The optimum level of P amendment is a critical issue when soluble P is used as a Pb immobilizing agent because of eutrophication resulting from excessive P leaching to surface and ground water. While the soluble P compound was effective in the immobilization of Pb, it resulted in P leaching which increased with increasing levels of P addition. However, rock phosphate amendment with PSB achieved the immobilization of Pb with a minimum effect on both Pb and P leaching. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},
