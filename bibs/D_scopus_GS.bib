abstract={Several types of vegetables were collected from two contaminated sites in Tianjin, China. The bulk soil and the rhizosphere soil samples were also collected from the same plots. Sixteen PAHs in the samples were measured. The total concentrations of PAH16 in the bulk soil from the two sites were 1.08 and 6.25 μg/g, respectively, with similar pattern. The concentrations of PAH16 and individual compounds in the rhizosphere were significantly higher than those in the bulk soil with mean values of 2.25 and 7.82 μg/g for the two sites, respectively. The contents of both total and dissolved organic matter in the rhizosphere were also higher than those in the bulk soil. Almost all PAH compounds studied were detected in both roots and aerial parts of the vegetables studied. Abundance of higher molecular weight PAHs in vegetable, however, was lower than that in soil. Concentrations of PAH16 in vegetable were higher than those reported in the literature for other areas. It appears that agricultural soils and vegetables in Tianjin, especially those from the site located immediately next to an urban district and irrigated with wastewater for several decades, are severely contaminated by PAHs. Among the eight types of vegetable studied, the highest concentration of PAHs was found in cauliflower. By average, the concentration of PAH16 in the aerial part of vegetables was 6.5 times higher as that in vegetable root, suggesting that foliar uptake is the primary transfer pathway of PAHs from environment to vegetables. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The Loess Plateau in northwest China is one of the most eroded landscapes in the world, and it is urgent that alternative practices be evaluated to control soil erosion. Our objective was to determine how three different tillage practices for monoculture of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) affected soil organic carbon (SOC) and N content after 11 years. Conventional tillage with residue removal (CT), shallow tillage with residue cover (ST), and no-tillage with residue cover (NT) were investigated. Carbon and N in various aggregate-size classes and various labile organic C fractions in the 0-15- and 15-30-cm soil layers were evaluated. The ST and NT treatments had 14.2 and 13.7% higher SOC stocks and 14.1 and 3.7% higher total N (Nt) stocks than CT in the upper 15 cm, respectively. Labile C fractions: particulate organic C (POC), permanganate oxidizable C (KMnO4-C), hot-water extractable C (HWC), microbial biomass C (MBC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) were all significantly higher in NT and ST than in CT in the upper 15 cm. KMnO4-C, POC and HWC were the most sensitive fractions to tillage changes. The portion of 0.25-2 mm aggregates, mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) of aggregates from ST and NT treatments were larger than from CT at both 0-15- and 15-30-cm soil depths. The ST and NT treatments had significantly higher SOC and Nt in the 0.25-2 mm fraction at both depths and significantly higher Nt content in the upper 15 cm. Positive significant correlations were observed between SOC, labile organic C fractions, MWD, GMD, and macroaggregate (0.25-2 mm) C within the upper 15 cm. We conclude that both variants of conservation tillage (NT and ST) increase SOC stock in the rainfed farming areas of northern China and are therefore more sustainable practices than those currently being used. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Soil organic carbon (SOC) and its labile fractions are strong determinants of chemical, physical, and biological properties, and soil quality. Thus, a 15-year experiment was established to assess how diverse soil fertility management treatments for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system affect SOC and total N (TN) concentrations in the North China Plain. The field experiment included three treatments: (1) unfertilized control (CK); (2) inorganic fertilizers (INF); and (3) farmyard manure (FYM). Concentrations of SOC, TN, and different labile SOC fractions were evaluated to 1-m depth. In comparison with INF and CK, FYM significantly increased SOC and TN concentrations in the 0-30 cm depth, and also those of dissolved organic C (DOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), hot-water extractable C (HWC), permanganate oxidizable C (KMnO 4-C), and particulate organic C (POC) in the 0-20 cm depth. Despite the higher crop yields over CK, application of INF neither increased the SOC nor the labile C fractions, suggesting that by itself INF is not a significant factor affecting SOC sequestration. Yet, POC (18.0-45.8% of SOC) and HWC (2.0-2.8%) were the most sensitive fractions affected by applications of FYM. Significantly positive correlations were observed between SOC and labile organic C fractions in the 0-20 cm depth. The data support the conclusion that, wherever feasible and practical, application of FYM is important to soil C sequestration and improving soil quality under a wheat/maize system in the North China Plain. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The tropical peat swamp forests of Indonesia and Malaysia are unusual ecosystems that are rich in endemic species of flora, fauna and microbes despite their extreme acidic, anaerobic, nutrient poor conditions. They are an important refuge for many endangered species including orang utans. Ecosystem functioning is unusual: microbial decomposition is inhibited because the leaves are sclerophyllous and toxic to deter herbivory in the nutrient poor environment, yet bacteria are abundant and active in the surface layers of the peat, where they respire DOC leached from newly fallen leaves. The bacteria are subsequently consumed by aquatic invertebrates that are eaten by fish, and bacterially respired CO2 is assimilated by algae, so bacteria are thus vital to carbon and nutrient cycling. Peat swamp forests are highly sensitive to the impacts of logging, drainage and fire, due to the interdependence of the vegetation with the peat substrate, which relies on the maintenance of adequate water, canopy cover and leaf litter inputs. Even minor disturbances can increase the likelihood of fire, which is the major cause of CO2 emissions from regional peat swamp forests and which impact ecosystems worldwide by contributing to climate change. Indo-Malayan peat swamps affect the hydrology of surrounding ecosystems due to their large water storage capacity which slows the passage of floodwaters in wet seasons and maintains stream base flows during dry seasons. These forests are of global importance yet they are inadequately protected and vanishing rapidly, particularly due to agricultural conversion to oil palm, logging, drainage and annual fires. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

abstract={Land usage is a strong determinant of soil microbial community composition and activity, which in turn determine organic matter decomposition rates and decomposition products in soils. Microbial communities in permanently flooded wetlands, such as those created by wetland restoration on Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta islands in California, function under restricted aeration conditions that result in increasing anaerobiosis with depth. It was hypothesized that the change from agricultural management to permanently flooded wetland would alter microbial community composition, increase the amount and reactivity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compounds in Delta waters; and have a predominant impact on microbial communities as compared with the effects of other environmental factors including soil type and agricultural management. Based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, active microbial communities of the restored wetlands were changed significantly from those of the agricultural fields, and wetland microbial communities varied widely with soil depth. The relative abundance of monounsaturated fatty acids decreased with increasing soil depth in both wetland and agricultural profiles, whereas branched fatty acids were relatively more abundant at all soil depths in wetlands as compared to agricultural fields. Decomposition conditions were linked to DOC quantity and quality using fatty acid functional groups to conclude that restricted aeration conditions found in the wetlands were strongly related to production of reactive carbon compounds. But current vegetation may have had an equally important role in determining DOC quality in restored wetlands. In a larger scale analysis, that included data from wetland and agricultural sites on Delta islands and data from two previous studies from the Sacramento Valley, an aeration gradient was defined as the predominant determinant of active microbial communities across soil types and land usage. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Characterization of pore water chemistry necessitates measurements of the chemical components at a high spatial resolution due to the heterogeneous nature of sediments. In this study, a novel high-resolution dialysis technique was developed for rapid sampling of dissolved reactive phosphate (DRP) and ferrous iron (Fe) in pore water at a vertical resolution of 2. mm. This technique employed a mini dialysis device (peeper) with a deployment time of 2. days in sediments for equilibration. Operational procedures following retrieval of the peeper include in situ freezing of the pore water samples through spraying commercial carbon dioxide snow, frozen storage of the pore water samples, and quick analysis of chemicals in pore water samples using 384-well microplate photometric methods. The sample consumption for each parameter can be minimized to 6 μL, which allowed simultaneous determination of DRP and ferrous iron in a peeper device. Laboratory tests showed that the technique was robust enough for the in situ measurements. Field deployment was subsequently performed in three sites of a shallow, eutrophic bay in Lake Taihu of China. Simultaneous determination of DRP and ferrous Fe in all the sites demonstrated a similar behavior of both chemicals in the pore water profiles, verifying the control of P mobilization by Fe in sediments. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Understanding the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) in response to changing environment and management practices is crucial for minimizing the climatic impacts of rice agriculture. This study examined the effects of rice straw incorporation on total SOC, active SOC fractions, and carbon pool management index (CPMI) in a subtropical paddy field in China. The straw collected after harvesting the early and late paddy was incorporated immediately into the top 10cm soil at a rate of 3.3Mgha-1 and the top 40cm soil samples in the triplicate treatment, control and reference plots were analyzed for the concentrations of total SOC and four other active SOC fractions at the end of the early and late seasons. The concentrations of total soil organic carbon (SOC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in the straw application plots than in the controls by 7.1-128.6% for both the early and late paddy season. In general, significant and positive correlations were observed between SOC, DOC, LFOC, MBC and labile organic carbon (LOC) in the treatment and control plots for both early and late paddy (r=0.60-0.96, P&lt;0.05). Moreover, there were significant and positive correlations of total SOC and active SOC fractions with both soil water content (r=0.69-0.94, P&lt;0.01) as well as total soil nitrogen content (r=0.69-0.99, P&lt;0.05). Straw incorporation significantly increased CPMI and other active soil organic carbon pools in the early paddy field (P&lt;0.05), but had no significant effects on CPMI in the late paddy field. It is therefore better to incorporate straw residues in the aerobic condition during the early paddy season in order for rice to benefit from an increased CPMI. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={It is crucial to advance the understanding of the soil carbon dioxide (CO2) flux and environmental factors for a better comprehension of carbon dynamics in subtropical ecosystems. Red soil, one of the typical agricultural soils in subtropical China, plays important roles in the global carbon budget due to their large potential to sequester C and replenish atmospheric C through soil CO2 flux. We examined the relationship between soil CO2 flux and environmental determinants in four different land use types of subtropical red soil-paddy (P), orchard (O), woodland (W) and upland (U) using static closed chamber method. Objectives were to evaluate the relationship of soil temperature, water-filled pore space (WFPS), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with the soil CO2 flux. Soil CO2 fluxes were measured on each site about every 14 days between 09:00 and 11:00 a.m. during 14-July 2004 to 25-April 2007 at the experimental station of Heshengqiao at Xianning, Hubei, China. Soil CO2 fluxes revealed seasonal fluctuations, with the tendency that maximum values occurred in summer, minimum in winter and intermediate values in spring and autumn except for paddy soil when it was submerged. Further, significant differences in soil CO2 fluxes were observed among the four soils, following the order of P &gt; O &gt; U ∼ W. Average soil CO2 fluxes were estimated as 901 ± 114, 727 ± 55, 554 ± 22 and 533 ± 27 (±S.D.) g CO2 m-2 year-1 in paddy, orchard, upland and woodland soils, respectively. Variations in soil CO2 flux were related to soil temperature, WFPS, and dissolved organic carbon with a combined R2 of 0.49-0.75. Soil temperature was an important variable controlling 26-59% of soil CO2 flux variability. The interaction of soil temperature and WFPS could explain 31-60% of soil CO2 flux variations for all the land use types. We conclude that soil CO2 flux from red soil is under environmental controls, soil temperature being the main variable, which interact with WFPS and DOC to control the supply of readily mineralizable substrates. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Labile fractions of organic matter can respond rapidly to changes in C supply and are considered to be important indicators of soil quality. However, much less is known on the impact of different land use systems and depth on labile organic matter fractions. The objective of this study was to estimate land use effects on a distribution of labile fraction organic C through soil profiles in the Sanjiang Plain of northeast China. Four land-use types were selected: Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland, upland forest, two farmlands (cultivated 9 and 15 yr, respectively) of soils previously under Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland, and abandoned cultivated soil. Soil total organic C (TOC), dissolved organic C, microbial organic C, and hot water-extractable C were measured. The results showed that the intact Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland soil had significantly higher labile fraction organic C contents in the topsoil when compared with upland forest, abandoned cultivated, and cultivated soils. However, there were no significant subsoil differences at all sites. The effects of land use on labile fraction organic C occurred mainly in the topsoil (0-20 cm). The labile fraction organic C contents decreased significantly with increasing soil depth in the intact Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland. However, the upland forest, abandoned cultivated, and cultivated soils showed a considerably smaller decrease in labile fraction organic C contents with increasing soil depth. The proportion of dissolved organic C, hot water-extractable C, and microbial biomass C to TOC increased to a maximum at a depth of about 20 to 30 cm, and then decreased with increasing soil depth in the Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland but not the other land use types. © Soil Science Society of America.},

abstract={A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using biosolids and Lolium perenne for the phytostabilization of copper mine tailings and to evaluate the patterns of metal accumulation and translocation in plants. Biosolids were applied either on the surface or mixed with the tailings at rates of 0, 6, and 12% w/w. All pots were seeded with L. perenne and after six months, the plants were harvested and separated into roots and shoots for metal concentrations analyses as well as some physiological characteristics of the plants. In order to correlate the metal content in plant tissues with some chemical properties, the pore-water of the substrates was analyzed for metals, pH and dissolved organic carbon. Results showed that biosolids application increased the dry biomass production of L. perenne and the shoot concentrations of N and chlorophyll. On the other hand, biosolids increased the concentration of Cu and Zn in the pore-water and in plant tissues. Despite this, there were no evident symptoms of phytotoxicity and the concentration of metals was within the normal ranges described for plants and below the maximum tolerable level for animals. In addition, plant tissue analysis showed that the application of biosolids could significantly reduce Mo uptake and shoot accumulation in plants. The metals were taken up by plants in the following order: Cu > Zn > Mo > Cd. The distribution patterns of metals in plants showed that metals were mainly accumulated in the roots and only a small amount of them were transported to the shoots. These results suggest that mixed application of biosolids (6%) and the use of L. perenne could be appropriate for use in programs of phytostabilization of copper mine tailings. However, these results should be tested under field conditions in order to confirm their efficacy under semi-arid Mediterranean climate conditions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Biochar derived from wheat straw was added to pig manure in amounts equivalent to 5%, 10%, or 15% (w/w, wet weight). The ratios of NH4+/NO3- and of UV light absorption at a wavelength of 254 nm (SUV254) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) indicated that compost with 10-15% biochar became more mature and more humified within 42 days of composting, and the content of DOC and the concentration of NH4+ in such compost decreased by 37.5-62.0% and 4.0-20.9%, respectively, compared to the corresponding levels in the control. Addition of biochar lowered the pH and increased electrical conductivity by 7.0-37.5% compared to the control and also increased the concentrations of water-soluble nutrients including PO43- (5.6-7.4%), K+ (14.2-58.6%), and Ca2+ (0-12.5%). It is therefore recommended that straw biochar be added to pig manure at 10-15% by weight. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Results showed that bacteria inoculated, including Azotobacter chroococcum, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus mucilaginosus, may pose both positive and negative impacts on bioavailability and mobility of heavy metals in soil, depending on the chemical nature of the metals. The activities of bacteria led to an increase of water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and a decrease of pH value, which enhanced metal mobility and bioavailability (e.g. an increase of water-soluble and HOAc-soluble Zn). On the other hand, bacteria could immobilize metals (e.g. a great reduction of water-soluble Pb) due to the adsorption by bacterial cell walls and possible sedimentation reactions with phosphate or other anions produced through bacterial metabolism. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={It has long been assumed that the peat underlying tropical peat swamp forests accumulates because the extreme conditions (water logged, nutrient poor, anaerobic and acidic-pH 2.9-3.5) impede microbial activity. Litterbag studies in a tropical Malaysian peat swamp (North Selangor peat swamp forest) showed that although the sclerophyllous, toxic leaves of endemic peat forest plants (Macaranga pruinosa, Campnosperma coriaceum, Pandanus atrocarpus, Stenochlaena palustris) were barely decomposed by bacteria and fungi (decay rates of only 0.0006-0.0016 k day-1), leaves of M. tanarius, a secondary forest species were almost completely decomposed (decay rates of 0.0047-0.005 k day-1) after 1 year. Thus it is intrinsic properties of the leaves (that are adaptations to deter herbivory in the nutrient poor environment) that impede microbial breakdown. The water of the peat swamp was very high in dissolved organic carbon (70-84 mg l-1 DOC). Laboratory studies revealed initial rapid leaching of DOC from leaves (up to 1,720 mg l -1 from 4 g of leaves in 7 days), but the DOC levels then fell rapidly. The leaching of DOC resulted in weight loss but the physical structure of the leaves remained intact. It is suggested that the DOC is used as a substrate for microbial growth hence lowering the concentration of DOC in the water and transferring energy from the leaves to other trophic levels. This would explain how nutrient poor tropical peatswamps support diverse, abundant flora and fauna despite low nutrient levels and lack of rapid litter cycling such as occurs in other types of tropical rainforests. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},
