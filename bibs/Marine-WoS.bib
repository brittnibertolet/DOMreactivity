Abstract = {{A new approach for parameterizing dissolved organic matter ( DOM)
   ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra is presented. Two distinct
   spectral slope regions ( 275-295 nm and 350-400 nm) within
   log-transformed absorption spectra were used to compare DOM from
   contrasting water types, ranging from wetlands (Great Dismal Swamp and
   Suwannee River) to photobleached oceanic water ( Atlantic Ocean). On the
   basis of DOM size-fractionation studies ( ultrafiltration and gel
   filtration chromatography), the slope of the 275-295- nm region and the
   ratio of these slopes (S-R; 275-295- nm slope : 350-400- nm slope) were
   related to DOM molecular weight ( MW) and to photochemically induced
   shifts in MW. Dark aerobic microbial alteration of chromophoric DOM (
   CDOM) resulted in spectral slope changes opposite of those caused by
   photochemistry. Along an axial transect in the Delaware Estuary, large
   variations in S-R were measured, probably due to mixing,
   photodegradation, and microbial alteration of CDOM as terrestrially
   derived DOM transited through the estuary. Further, SR varied by over a
   factor of 13 between DOM-rich wetland waters and Sargasso Sea surface
   waters. Currently, there is no consensus on a wavelength range for
   log-transformed absorption spectra. We propose that the 275-295- nm
   slope be routinely reported in future DOM studies, as it can be measured
   with high precision, it facilitates comparison among dissimilar water
   types including CDOM-rich wetland and CDOM-poor marine waters, and it
   appears to be a good proxy for DOM MW.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex and poorly understood
   mixture of organic polymers that plays an influential role in aquatic
   ecosystems. In this study we have successfully characterised the
   fluorescent fraction of DOM in the catchment of a Danish estuary using
   fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy and parallel factor
   analysis (PARAFAC). PARAFAC aids the characterisation of fluorescent DOM
   by decomposing the fluorescence matrices into different independent
   fluorescent components. The results reveal that at least five different
   fluorescent DOM fractions present (in significant amounts) in the
   catchment and that the relative composition is dependent on the source
   (e.g. agricultural runoff, forest soil, aquatic production). Four
   different allochthonous fluorescent groups and one autochthonous
   fluorescent group were identified. The ability to trace the different
   fractions of the DOM pool using this relatively cheap and fast technique
   represents a significant advance within the fields of aquatic ecology
   and chemistry, and will prove to be useful for catchment management. (C)

Abstract = {{Each year rivers transport approximately 0.25 x 10(15) g of dissolved (<
   0.5 mu m) organic carbon (DOG) and 0.15 x 10(15) g of particulate (> 0.5
   mu m) organic carbon (POC) from continents to the ocean. Global
   discharge of riverine DOC is sufficient alone to sustain turnover of the
   entire pool of organic carbon dissolved in seawater. Similarly, the
   input of terrestrial POC by rivers is adequate to supply all the organic
   carbon buried in marine sediments. Because riverine organic matter
   consists of highly degraded, nitrogen-poor remains of terrestrial
   organisms, it might be expected to suffer minimal respiration in the
   ocean. One of the biggest mysteries in the global carbon cycle,
   therefore, is that only a small fraction of the organic matter dissolved
   in seawater and preserved in marine sediments appears to be
   land-derived. Either our global budgets and distribution estimates are
   greatly in error, or both dissolved and particulate organic matter of
   terrestrial origin suffer rapid and remarkably extensive
   remineralization at sea. Although many uncertainties remain, recent
   studies provide growing evidence for destruction of both dissolved and
   particulate terrestrial organic matter in the ocean. The mechanisms by
   which these huge masses of organic materials might be so rapidly
   oxidized following discharge are largely unknown. This report focuses on
   the transport and transformations of land-derived organic matter in the
   ocean, highlighting recent research on the patterns and processes
   involved. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We used a method that combines microautoradiography with hybridization
   of fluorescent rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to whole cells
   (MICRO-FISH) to test the hypothesis that the relative contributions of
   various phylogenetic groups to the utilization of dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) depend solely on their relative abundance in the bacterial
   community. We found that utilization of even simple low-molecular-weight
   DOM components by bacteria differed across the major phylogenetic groups
   and often did not correlate with the relative abundance of these
   bacterial groups in estuarine and coastal environments. The
   Cytophaga-Flavobacter cluster was overrepresented in the portion of the
   assemblage consuming chitin, N-acetylglucosamine, and protein but was
   generally underrepresented in the assemblage consuming amino acids. The
   amino acid-consuming assemblage was usually dominated by the alpha
   subclass of the class Proteobacteria, although the representation of
   alpha-proteobacteria in the protein-consuming assemblages was about that
   expected from their relative abundance in the entire bacterial
   community. In our experiments, no phylogenetic group dominated the
   consumption of all DOM, suggesting that the participation of a diverse
   assemblage of bacteria is essential for the complete degradation of
   complex DOM in the oceans. These results also suggest that the role of
   aerobic heterotrophic bacteria in carbon cycling would be more
   accurately described by using three groups instead of the single
   bacterial compartment currently used in biogeochemical models.}},

Abstract = {{LARGE, rapidly sinking organic aggregates are an important component of
   the carbon flux from the ocean's surface to its depths. Marine snow, the
   main type of large (>0.5 mm) aggregate, is heavily colonized by bacteria
   in surface waters1, yet the carbon demand of the attached bacteria is so
   small that months to years are required to consume the aggregates'
   carbon2-5. This has led to the conclusion that marine aggregates are
   resistant to degradation by attached bacteria, and thus act as
   refractory carriers of carbon to the deep ocean. Here we report that
   aggregates play host to intense activities of hydrolytic enzymes
   (presumably due to cell surface bound and released enzymes of the
   attached bacteria), which render the aggregates soluble. Particulate
   amino acids were hydrolysed rapidly (turnover time 0.2-2.1 days), with
   very little of the hydrolysate being taken up by the attached bacteria.
   Our results support the hypothesis6,7 that such `uncoupled' hydrolysis
   is a biochemical mechanism for large-scale transfer of organic matter
   from sinking particles to the dissolved phase, and may supply the slowly
   degradable dissolved organic matter for downward export postulated by
   recent models8-10.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial utilization of high-molecular-weight (HMW; >1 kDa) and

   separate HMW and LMW DOC. More than 80\% of the DOC in Amazon River
   samples was recovered in the HMW fraction, whereas most marine DOC (up
   to 70\%) was of LMW. Bacterial growth efficiencies were consistently
   higher in the LMW fractions (16-66\%) than in the HMW fractions
   (8-39\%), indicating compositional differences in the two size
   fractions. In all experiments, measured rates of bacterial growth and
   respiration in HMW incubations were higher than those in LMW
   incubations. Carbon-normalized bacterial DOC utilization rates were
   1.4-4-fold greater in the HMW fractions than in the LMW fractions, and a
   greater proportion (0.7-22.5\%) of HMW DOC was utilized per day than LMW
   DOC (0.5-6.6\%). All bacterial growth and respiration measurements
   indicated that HMW DOC was utilized to a greater extent than LMW DOC in
   all environments investigated. The traditional model of DOM degradation,
   stating that LMW compounds are most bioreactive, does not appear to
   apply to the bulk of natural DOM. Rather, the data and results from
   independent studies suggest a new conceptual model whereby the
   bioreactivity of organic matter decreases along a continuum of size
   (from large to small) and diagenetic state (from fresh to old). This
   size-reactivity continuum model suggests that the bulk of HMW DOM is
   more bioreactive and less diagenetically altered than the bulk of LMW
   DOM.}},

Abstract = {{The isolation, characterization and study of the properties of aquatic
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) still represent a challenge because of
   the heterogeneity, complexity and low concentration of organic material
   in natural waters. Based on its ability to interact with contaminants
   and thus to modify their transport and bioavailability, DOM is of
   interest for environmental purposes. The objective of this work was to
   better characterize DOM in the Gironde Estuary (southwestern France).
   The estuary represents an exchange zone between the continent and the
   Atlantic Ocean and conditions the transfer of organic and inorganic
   substances from the continental to the oceanic environment. Several
   samples were collected along the estuary during three cruises in 2002
   and 2006. They were analysed using excitation-emission matrix (EEM)
   spectroscopy, a sensitive technique that allows direct analysis of water
   samples. Fluorescent DOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) did not
   behave conservatively in this estuarine system, i.e. the organic
   material did not undergo simple dilution from the upstream to the
   downstream part of the estuary. A seasonal variability in DOC content
   was pointed out, whereas few seasonal variations in DOM fluorescence
   were observed. DOM sources and processing in the estuary were further
   evaluated by determining two fluorescence indices - the humification
   index (HIX) and the index of recent autochthonous contribution (BIX). By
   applying these indices, the relative degree of humification (HIX) and
   autotrophic productivity (BIX) could be assessed. Based on the
   fluorescence and DOC results, the estuary was divided into three zones
   depending on salinity (S) and characterized by specific DOM: (i) A
   turbid zone of low salinity (S < 5) and high suspended particulate
   matter concentration with increase in the intensities of the alpha' and
   alpha fluorophores, characteristic of humic-like compounds. (ii) A
   mid-estuarine zone (5 < S < 25) characterized by low autortrophic
   productivity and containing strongly degraded organic material, as shown
   by the low values of BIX and high values of HIX. (iii) A higher salinity
   area (S > 25) characterized by increased autortrophic productivity and a
   marked marine influence, and associated with high and low values of BIX
   and HIX, respectively. The HIX and BIX indices were shown as useful
   tools for readily defining and classifying DOM characteristics in
   estuarine waters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polysaccharide-specific staining techniques reveal the existence and
   high abundance of a class of large, discrete, transparent particles in
   seawater and diatom cultures formed from dissolved exopolymers exuded by
   phytoplankton and bacteria. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP),
   ranged from 28 to 5000 particles ml-1 and from 3 to 100s mum in longest
   dimension at five coastal stations off California. A high percentage of
   seemingly free-living bacteria (28-68\%) were attached to these
   transparent sheets and films, suggesting that they may alter the
   distributions and microenvironments of marine microbes in nature.
   Preliminary coagulation experiments demonstrated that TEP are major
   agents in the aggregation of diatoms and in the formation of marine
   snow. The existence of microbial exudates acting as large, discrete
   particles, rather than as dissolved molecules or as coating on other
   particles, suggests that the transformation of dissolved organic matter
   into particulate form in the sea can occur via a rapid abiotic pathway
   as well as through conventional microbial uptake. The existence of these
   particles has far reaching implications for food web structure,
   microbial processes, carbon cycling and particulate flux in the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic systems originates from a
   range of sources. Some is allochthonous, transported from the
   surrounding landscape to the water body, and is derived from and
   influenced by the geology, land use and hydrology of its origin. Some is
   created in situ through microbial activity, which may provide an
   independent source of organic matter, or a recycling mechanism for that
   which has been transported into the water body. The relative
   contribution of each source depends upon the location and environmental
   conditions within and without the water body. Human activity is also a
   source of DOM, much of which is believed to be labile, which can enter
   the aquatic system through direct point discharges, diffuse leaching and
   aerial dispersal. Fluorescence spectroscopy can provide an excellent
   too] to source DOM fractions, and to monitor and understand DOM
   transformations in aquatic systems, as much DOM has an intrinsic
   fluorescence. In particular, recent advances in optical technology,
   enabling rapid investigation of shorter wavelengths, have enabled more
   detailed characterization of organic material and its reactions in
   water. In this article, we review the use of fluorescence spectroscopic
   techniques to measure the intrinsic fluorescence of organic matter and

Abstract = {{Sorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is considered to be a major
   process in the preservation of organic matter (OM) in marine sediments.
   Evidence for this hypothesis includes the close relationship between
   sediment surface area (SA) and organic carbon (OC) concentrations and
   the strongly reduced biological degradability after DOM has sorbed to
   mineral surfaces. The aim of this study was to discuss the possibility
   of a similar process in the soil environment. We accomplished this by
   gathering information from the literature, and by an evaluation of our
   own studies on DOM sorption and accumulation of OM in soil. We found
   that in soil a close association of OM with the mineral matrix exists.
   Both the concentration of soil OM associated with the mineral matrix,
   and the sorption of DOM are related to reactive mineral phases such as
   Al and Fe oxyhydroxides. Sorption of DOM derived from the oxidative
   decomposition of lignocellulose to Al and Fe oxyhydroxides involves
   strong complexation bondings between surface metals and acidic organic
   ligands, particularly with those associated with aromatic structures.
   The strength of the sorption relates to the surface area but more
   importantly to the surface properties of the sorbing mineral phase. The
   sorption of a large part of DOM is hardly reversible under conditions
   similar to those during sorption (hysteresis). Because sorption of the
   more labile polysaccharide-derived DOM on mineral surfaces is weaker,
   adsorptive and desorptive processes strongly favour the accumulation of
   the more recalcitrant lignin-derived DOM. In addition, we found the soil
   OM in an alluvial B horizon and in the clay fraction of a topsoil
   strongly resembling lignin-derived DOM from the overlying forest floors.
   Hence, it seems likely that sorption of DOM contributes considerably to
   the accumulation and preservation of OM in soil. However, this does not
   result in a significant relationship between OC concentration and SA.
   Reasons for that finding may be the ``masking{''} of mineral surfaces by
   adsorbed OM, the clustering of OM patches at highly reactive sites of
   metal hydroxides, and/or the absence of a relationship between SA and
   the concentration of surface-active Fe and Al oxyhydroxides in some soil
   types. Overall, we conclude that sorptive preservation of OM in soil is
   affected by the chemical structure of the sorbing DOM and the surface
   properties of the mineral matrix. Localisation and conformation of
   sorbed OM remains unclear and therefore should be subject of further
   research. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A large pool of organic carbon resides in the world's oceans in the form
   of dissolved organic matter (DOM)(1,2). DOM is operationally defined as
   the fraction of organic matter that passes through a filter with a given
   pore size (which can range from less than 0.1 mu m to 0.46 mu m). This
   fraction has a longer oceanic residence time-and is generally less
   biodegradable-than particulate organic matter (POM)(1-4). Processes
   transforming DOM into POM are therefore crucial for our understanding of
   the cycling of organic material in the oceans(1-4). The aggregation of
   marine colloids, which constitute 10-40\% of DOM(2,3,5), is thought to
   be an important step in the transformation of DOM into POM(3). it has
   been suggested that colloids, as well as transparent exopolymer
   particles and large aggregates ('marine snow') can be viewed as polymer
   gels(6-8). Whether free DOM polymers can indeed spontaneously assemble
   to form polymer gels has, however, not yet been shown, Here we present
   experimental observations that demonstrate that marine polymer gels can
   assemble from free DOM polymers, and that their formation mechanism,
   physical characteristics and mineralization can be understood in terms
   of polymer gel theory(9-11). The principles and methods of polymer gel
   physics thus have the potential to provide profound new insights into
   the processes controlling-the exchange between the DOM and POM pools and
   the cycling of marine organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{PLANKTONIC bacteria are a fundamental component of the organic carbon
   cycle in aquatic systems(1). Organic carbon consumption by planktonic
   bacteria is the sum of bacterial production (BP) and bacterial
   respiration (BR), IL is now estimated that. 30-60\% of phytoplankton
   production (the amount of inorganic carbon fixed by phytoplankton
   photosynthesis, corrected far phytoplankton respiration) in marine and
   freshwater systems is processed by bacterial(1-3). These estimates of
   carbon flow through bacteria are conservative, however, because losses
   due to bacterial respiration are seldom directly measured(4,5). We
   report here that bacterial respiration is generally high, and tends to
   exceed phytoplankton net production in unproductive systems (less than
   70 to 120 mu g carbon per litre per day). A large proportion of the
   world's aquatic systems have phytoplankton productivities below this
   value(6). Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) is the result of BP and
   BR{[}BGE = BP/(BR + BP)]. Comparisons of our models of bacterial
   respiration with published models of bacterial secondary production(1,7)
   show that bacterial growth efficiency must range fi om less than 10\% to
   25\% in most freshwater and marine systems, well below the values
   commonly assumed in many current ecological models(1,2,8,9). The
   imbalance between bacterial respiration and phytoplankton production

Abstract = {{Terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) impacts the optical
   properties of coastal seawater and affects carbon cycling on a global

   degradation of estuarine dissolved organic matter from the Satilla
   River, an estuary in the southeastern United States that is dominated by
   vascular plant-derived organic matter. During photodegradation,
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loss (amounting to 31\% of the initial
   DOC) was much less extensive than colored dissolved organic matter
   (CDOM) or fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) loss (50\% and
   56\% of the initial CDOM and FDOM), and analysis of kinetics suggested a
   reservoir of DOC that was resistant to photodegradation. In contrast,
   CDOM photodegradation closely followed first-order kinetics over two
   hall-lives with no indication of a nondegradable component. FDOM loss
   was slightly biased toward fluorophores considered representative of
   terrestrial humic substances. Additional changes in optical properties
   included increases in spectral slope and shifts in fluorescence
   excitation/emission maxima that were generally consistent with previous
   observations from field studies of photobleached DOM. Biological
   degradation of photobleached DOM was more rapid than that of unbleached
   material, and this net positive effect was evident even for extensively
   photodegraded material. Bacterial degradation caused shifts in the
   opposite direction from photochemical degradation for both spectral
   slope and excitation/emission maxima and thus dampened but did not
   eliminate changes in optical properties caused by photobleaching.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed published rates of extracellular release (ER) of organic

   regression model based on 225 observations, PP explained 69\% of the
   variance in ER. From this model we estimate the average percent
   extracellular release (PER) to be 13\% of total fixation. The slope of
   this relationship does not support the hypothesis that the PER declines
   with increasing productivity. Differences exist between marine and
   freshwater systems. In lakes, ER increases nonlinearly with
   productivity, resulting in very low PER in very eutrophic systems. In
   coastal marine and estuarine systems, ER increases linearly with
   productivity and the PER does not vary systematically. ER is not
   primarily related to phytoplankton biomass as predicted by passive
   diffusion models. Instead, ER appears to be constrained by the total
   availability of photosynthates. By comparing our model to an existing
   model of bacterial production and assuming a 50\% growth efficiency, we
   estimate that ER amounts to less than half the C required for bacterial

Abstract = {{Most of the oceanic reservoir of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is of

   natural assemblages of marine bacteria rapidly (in < 48 hours) utilized
   labile compounds (glucose, glutamate) and produced refractory DOM that
   persisted for more than a year. Only 10 to 15\% of the bacterially
   derived DOM was identified as hydrolyzable amino acids and sugars, a
   feature consistent with marine DOM. These results suggest that microbial

   further degradation and thereby preserving fixed carbon in the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major conundrums in oceanography for the past 20 y has been
   that, although the total flux of dissolved organic carbon (OC; DOC)
   discharged annually to the global ocean can account for the turnover
   time of all oceanic DOC (ca. 4,000-6,000 y), chemical biomarker and
   stable isotopic data indicate that there is very little terrestrially
   derived OC (TerrOC) in the global ocean. Similarly, it has been
   estimated that only 30\% of the TerrOC buried in marine sediments is of
   terrestrial origin in muddy deltaic regions with high sedimentation
   rates. If vascular plant material-assumed to be highly resistant to
   decay-makes up much of the DOC and particulate OC of riverine OC (along
   with soil OC), why do we not see more TerrOC in coastal and oceanic
   waters and sediments? An explanation for this ``missing{''} TerrOC in
   the ocean is critical in our understanding of the global carbon cycle.
   Here, I consider the origin of vascular plants, the major component of
   TerrOC, and how their appearance affected the overall cycling of OC on
   land. I also examine the role vascular plant material plays in soil OC,
   inland aquatic ecosystems, and the ocean, and how our understanding of
   TerrOC and ``priming{''} processes in these natural systems has gained
   considerable interests in the terrestrial literature, but has largely
   been ignored in the aquatic sciences. Finally, I close by postulating
   that priming is in fact an important process that needs to be
   incorporated into global carbon models in the context of climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Biological oceanographers generally distinguish between two contrasting
   trophic pathways in the pelagic environment, i.e. the herbivorous and
   the microbial food webs. The former goes from large phytoplankton and
   zooplankton to fish, whereas the latter comprises small eukaryotic algae
   and cyanobacteria as well as heterotrophic bacteria and protozoa. The
   present paper describes a continuum of trophic pathways, between systems
   dominated by the herbivorous food web and those dominated by the
   microbial loop (i.e. almost closed system of heterotrophic bacteria and
   zooflagellate grazers, the latter releasing dissolved organic matter
   used as substrate by the bacteria). It is proposed that the continuum
   goes from the herbivorous web (or chain) to a `'multivorous food web'',
   to the microbial web, and finally the microbial loop. Characteristics of
   the various pathways may be summarized as a series of interconnected
   ratios. It is hypothesized that systems dominated by the herbivorous
   food web or the microbial loop are of transient nature and thus
   inherently unstable, whereas the multivorous and microbial food webs
   have higher stability and are thus longer lasting. This view is
   supported by a review of properties of several systems, that include
   herbivorous webs of the spring phytoplankton bloom and in upwelling
   areas, the multivorous web in the `'high nutrient low chlorophyll''
   region of the North Pacific Ocean, a microbial web at a retreating ice
   edge off Antarctica, and the microbial loop in oligotrophic waters where
   the biomass of bacteria significantly exceeds that of phytoplankton.}},

Abstract = {{The algal osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is recognised as
   the major precursor of marine dimethylsulfide (DMS), a volatile sulfur
   compound that affects atmospheric chemistry and global climate. Recent
   studies, using S-35-DMSP tracer techniques, suggest that DMSP may play
   additional very important roles in the microbial ecology and
   biogeochemistry of the surface ocean. DMSP may serve as an intracellular
   osmolyte in bacteria that take up phytoplankton-derived DMSP from
   seawater. In addition, DMSP appears to support from 1 to 13\% of the
   bacterial carbon demand in surface waters, making it one of the most
   significant single substrates for bacterioplankton so far identified.
   Furthermore, the sulfur from DMSP is efficiently incorporated into
   bacterial proteins (mostly into methionine) and DMSP appears to be a
   major source of sulfur for marine bacterioplankton. Assimilatory
   metabolism of DMSP is via methanethiol (MeSH) chat is produced by a
   demethylation/demethiolation pathway which dominates DMSP degradation in
   situ. Based on the linkage between assimilatory metabolism of DMSP and
   bacterial growth, we offer a hypothesis whereby DMSP availability to
   bacteria controls the production of DMS by the competing DMSP lyase
   pathway. Also linked with the assimilatory metabolism of DMSP is the
   production of excess MeSH which, if not assimilated into protein, reacts
   to form dissolved non-volatile compounds. These include sulfate and
   DOM-metal-MeSH complexes, both of which represent major short-term
   end-products of DMSP degradation. Because production rates of MeSH in
   seawater are high (3-90 nM d(-1)), reaction of MeSH with trace metals
   could affect metal availability and chemistry in seawater. Overall,
   results of recent studies provide evidence that DMSP plays important
   roles in the carbon, sulfur and perhaps metal and DOM cycles in marine
   microbial communities. These findings, coupled with the fact that the
   small fraction of DMSP converted to DMS may influence atmospheric
   chemistry and climate dynamics, draws attention to DMSP as a molecule of
   central importance to marine biogeochemical and ecological processes.

Abstract = {{Congo River water was filtered and then irradiated for 57 d in a solar
   simulator, resulting in extensive photodegradation of dissolved organic
   matter (DOM). Whole-water (i.e., unfractionated) DOM was analyzed pre-
   and post-irradiation using ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), revealing the following three
   pools of DOM classified based upon their photoreactivity: (1)
   photo-resistant, (2) photo-labile, and (3) photo-produced.
   Photo-resistant DOM was heterogeneous, with most molecular classes
   represented, although only a small number of aromatics and no condensed
   aromatics were identified. The photo-produced pool was dominated by
   aliphatic compounds, although it included a small number of aromatics,
   including condensed aromatics. Aromatic compounds were the most
   photoreactive, with. 90\% being lost upon irradiation. Photochemistry
   also resulted in a significant drop in the number of molecules
   identified and a decrease in their structural diversity. The FT-ICR MS
   signatures of two classes of refractory organic matter, black carbon and
   carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM), were present in the sample
   prior to irradiation, indicating that the Congo River could be a
   significant exporter of recalcitrant DOM to the ocean. All black
   carbon-like molecules identified in the initial sample were lost during
   irradiation. Molecular signatures consistent with CRAM were also highly
   photo-labile, demonstrating that environmental solar irradiation levels
   are capable of removing these refractory compounds from aquatic systems.
   Irradiation also shifted the molecular signature of terrestrial DOM
   toward that of marine DOM, thereby complicating the task of tracking
   terrestrial DOM in the ocean.}},

   at 300 nm and initial fluorescence (360/460 nm) in all waters tested.
   Photochemical production was also linearly related to loss
   (photobleaching) of absorbance and fluorescence during irradiation,
   irrespective of irradiation time and prior photobleaching history of the
   sample. These results were attributed to absorption of light by humic
   substances in the waters, as determined by experiments where purified
   humic and fulvic extracts were added to open-ocean water. The
   wavelengths in the solar spectrum responsible for photoproduction of LMW
   carbonly compounds and bleaching of dissolved organic matter light
   absorbance are in the UV-B region (280-320 nm). These results, plus
   results from time-course irradiations, suggest that photoproduction of
   carbonyl compounds from humic substances is closely related to
   photobleaching of absorbance. Based on our photoproduction rates of LMW
   carbonyl compounds, we estimate that the half-life of humic-rich
   riverine dissolved organic C in the oceanic mixed layer is 5-15 yr.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments employing radiotracer methodology were conducted
   to determine the assimilation efficiencies from ingested natural seston,
   the influx rates from the dissolved phase and the efflux rates of 6
   trace elements (Ag, Am, Cd, Co, Se and Zn) in the mussel Mytilus edulis.
   A kinetic model was then employed to predict trace element concentration
   in mussel tissues in 2 locations for which mussel and environmental data
   are well described: South San Francisco Bay (California, USA) and Long
   Island Sound (New York, USA). Assimilation efficiencies from natural
   seston ranged from 5 to 18\% for Ag, 0.6 to 1\% for Am, 8 to 20\% for
   Cd, 12 to 16\% for Co, 28 to 34\% for Se, and 32 to 41\% for Zn.
   Differences in chlorophyll a concentration in ingested natural seston
   did not have significant impact on the assimilation of Am, Co, Se and
   Zn. The influx rate of elements from the dissolved phase increased with
   the dissolved concentration, conforming to Freundlich adsorption
   isotherms. The calculated dissolved uptake rate constant was greatest
   for Ag, followed by Zn > Am approximate to Cd > Co > Se. The estimated
   absorption efficiency from the dissolved phase was 1.53\% for Ag, 0.34\%
   for Am, 0.31\% for Cd, 0.11\% for Co, 0.03\% for Se and 0.89\% for Zn.
   Salinity had an inverse effect on the influx rate from the dissolved
   phase and dissolved organic carbon concentration had no significant
   effect on trace element uptake. The calculated efflux rate constants for
   all elements ranged from 1.0 to 3.0\% d(-1). The route of trace element
   uptake (food vs dissolved) and the duration of exposure to dissolved
   trace elements (12 h vs 6 d) did not significantly influence trace
   element efflux rates. A model which used the experimentally determined
   influx and efflux rates for each of the trace elements, following
   exposure from ingested food and from water, predicted concentrations of
   Ag, Cd, Se and Zn in mussels that were directly comparable to actual
   tissue concentrations independently measured in the 2 reference sites in
   national monitoring programs. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the
   total suspended solids load, which can affect mussel feeding activity,
   assimilation, and trace element concentration in the dissolved and
   particulate phases, can significantly influence metal bioaccumulation
   for particle-reactive elements such as Ag and Am. For all metals,
   concentrations in mussels are proportionately related to total metal
   load in the water column and their assimilation efficiency from ingested
   particles. Further, the model predicted that over 96\% of Se in mussels
   is obtained from ingested food, under conditions typical of coastal
   waters. For Ag, Am, Cd, Co and Zn, the relative contribution from the
   dissolved phase decreases significantly with increasing trace element
   partition coefficients for suspended particles and the assimilation
   efficiency in mussels of ingested trace elements; values range between
   33 and 67\% for Ag, 5 and 17\% for Am, 47 and 82\% for Cd, 4 and 30\%
   for Co, and 17 and 51\% for Zn.}},

Abstract = {{We examined bacterial dynamics in batch cultures of two axenic marine
   diatoms (Thalassiosira rotula and Skeletonema costatum). The axenic
   diatoms were inoculated with natural bacterial assemblages and monitored
   by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenolindole (DAPI) counts, denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE) with subsequent analysis of excised, sequenced
   16S rRNA gene fragments, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
   with group-specific 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probes. Our results show
   that algal growth exhibited pronounced differences in axenic treatments
   and when bacteria were present. Bacterial abundance and community
   structure greatly depended on species, growth and physiological status
   of even closely related algae. Free-living and phytoplankton-associated
   bacteria were very different from each other and were dominated by
   distinct phylogenetic groups. The diatom-associated bacteria mainly
   belonged to the Flavobacteria-Sphingobacteria group of the Bacteroidetes
   phylum whereas free-living bacteria, which were rather similar in both
   cultures, comprised mainly of members of the Roseobacter group of
   alpha-Proteobacteria. Presence and disappearance of specific bacteria
   during algal growth indicated pronounced differences in environmental
   conditions over time and selection of bacteria highly adapted to the
   changing conditions. Tight interactions between marine bacteria and
   diatoms appear to be important for the decomposition of organic matter
   and nutrient cycling in the sea.}},

Abstract = {{The Arctic Ocean is, on a volume basis, the ocean with the highest
   terrestrial input in terms of freshwater and organic matter. The
   drainage areas of the Arctic contain more than half of the organic
   carbon stored globally in soils and are extremely sensitive to climate
   change. These changes may considerably influence the huge continental
   flux of water and organic and inorganic constituents to the Arctic
   Ocean. Because of the immediate global concerns we here review the
   current knowledge about the biogeochemistry of the Arctic river and
   shelf ecosystem. Organic matter concentrations in the Arctic rivers are
   among the highest reported in world's rivers. Dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) reaches concentrations of up to 1000 muM C. The total amount of
   DOC discharged by rivers into the Arctic Ocean is 18 - 26 x 10(12) g C
   year(-1) and similar to that of the Amazon. The discharge of particulate
   organic carbon is much lower with 4 - 6 X 10(12) g C year(-1). Nitrogen
   and phosphorus are principally discharged as organic compounds. The
   concentrations of inorganic nutrients are among the lowest worldwide
   (inorganic nitrogen: 0 - 20 muM; phosphate: 0 - 0.8 muM), with the
   exception of silicate in some rivers (0.5 - 110 muM). Freshly produced
   organic matter is labile and its turnover rates are high in the Arctic
   Ocean. Riverine organic matter, in contrast, is soil-derived and
   refractory. It seems to behave biogeochemically stable in the estuaries
   and shelves and therefore does not substantially support the
   productivity of the Arctic Ocean. Suspended organic matter from the
   rivers principally settles in the estuaries and on the shelves, hence
   the terrigenous signature in the sediment decreases with distance from
   the coast. However, a fraction of terrigenous suspended matter escapes
   the shelves and is present in considerable amounts even in sediments of
   the central Arctic Ocean. Terrigenous dissolved organic matter, on the
   other hand, behaves primarily conservatively in the Arctic Ocean. There
   are practically no removal mechanisms in the estuaries and shelves. The
   molecular composition of dissolved organic matter can largely be
   explained as a mixture of refractory marine and terrigenous compounds.
   Therefore, the Arctic river discharge plays an important role as a
   contemporary sink in the global carbon cycle. The few available data on
   the biogeochemistry of the Russian rivers indicate that the proportion
   of taiga and tundra in the drainage areas has no considerable influence
   on the concentration and chemical composition of dissolved organic
   matter, with the exception of lignin-derived phenols, which can be used
   as chemotaxonomic tracers. It can therefore be speculated that changes
   in vegetation due to climate warming may not considerably influence the
   composition of dissolved organic matter discharged to the Arctic Ocean.
   The discharge of inorganic nutrients, however, may already have
   increased in the last decades, as indicated by long-term increases in
   winter water discharge and the seasonality of nutrient concentrations.
   For a reliable assessment of future changes long-term and seasonal data
   of nutrient and organic matter discharge, as well as more detailed
   biogeochemical information is urgently needed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The chemical structure of refractory marine dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) is still largely unknown. Electrospray ionization Fourier
   transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR-MS) was
   used to resolve the complex mixtures of DOM and provide valuable
   information on elemental compositions on a molecular scale. We
   characterized and compared DOM from two sharply contrasting aquatic
   environments, algal-derived DOM from the Weddell Sea (Antarctica) and
   terrigenous DOM from pore water of a tropical mangrove area in northern
   Brazil. Several thousand molecular formulas in the mass range of 300-600
   Da were identified and reproduced in element ratio plots. On the basis
   of molecular elemental composition and double-bond equivalents (DBE) we
   calculated an average composition for marine DOM. O/C ratios in the
   marine samples were lower (0.36 +/- 0.01) than in the mangrove
   pore-water sample (0.42). A small proportion of chemical formulas with
   higher molecular mass in the marine samples were characterized by very
   low O/C and H/C ratios probably reflecting amphiphilic properties. The
   average number of unsaturations in the marine samples was surprisingly
   high (DBE = 9.9; mangrove pore water: DBE = 9.4) most likely due to a
   significant contribution of carbonyl carbon. There was no significant
   difference in elemental composition between surface and deep-water DOM
   in the Weddell Sea. Although there were some molecules with unique
   marine elemental composition, there was a conspicuous degree of
   similarity between the terrigenous and algal-derived end members.
   Approximately one third of the molecular formulas were present in all
   marine as well as in the mangrove samples. We infer that different forms
   of microbial degradation ultimately lead to similar structural features
   that are intrinsically refractory, independent of the source of the
   organic matter and the environmental conditions where degradation took
   place. Copyright (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.}},

   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) uptake and total organic carbon (TOC)
   production in all phytoplankton except Emiliania, which synthesizes
   carbonate-containing coccoliths. Rates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   production during phytoplankton growth ranged from 5 to 13 mu M DOC

Abstract = {{The distributions of fluorescent components in dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) from Ise Bay, Japan, were determined by excitation emission matrix
   (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis
   (PARAFAC). Three terrestrial humic-like, one marine humic-like, and
   three non-humic-like fluorescent components were identified by PARAFAC,
   and the environmental dynamics of individual fluorescent components in
   the bay area were evaluated. The observed linear relationships between
   salinity and abundance of two of the three humic-like components in the
   bay area indicate a terrestrial origin and conservative mixing behavior
   of these components. On the other hand, nonconservative mixing for the
   other terrestrial and the marine humic-like components was observed,
   indicating that the sources of these were other than solely riverine
   inputs. Thus, in addition to riverine sources, this terrestrial
   humic-like component may receive inputs from biogeochemical reworking of
   terrestrial DOM and/or particulate organic matter, while the most likely
   sources for the marine humic-like component are estuarine biological
   activity and/or microbial reworking of plankton-derived DOM. From the
   spatial distributions in the bay area as well as their relationships
   with salinity, two of the non-humic-like components were suggested to be
   of autochthonous estuarine origin and likely represent biologically
   labile components. Microbial degradation processes were suggested to be
   important factors driving the dynamics of another non-humic-like
   component. This study exemplifies the potential applicability of
   EEM-PARAFAC in studies of fluorescent DOM dynamics in estuaries.}},

Abstract = {{Source, transformation, and preservation mechanisms of dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) remain elemental questions in contemporary marine and
   aquatic sciences and represent a missing link in models of global
   elemental cycles. Although the chemical character of DOM is central to
   its fate in the global carbon cycle, DOM characterizations in long-term
   ecological research programs are rarely performed. We analyzed the
   variability in the quality of 134 DOM samples collected from 12 Long
   Term Ecological Research stations by quantification of organic carbon
   and nitrogen concentration in addition to analysis of UV-visible
   absorbance and fluorescence spectra. The fluorescence spectra were
   further characterized by parallel factor analysis. There was a large
   range in both concentration and quality of the DOM, with the dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) concentration ranging from less than 1 mgC/L to
   over 30 mgC/L. The ranges of specific UV absorbance and fluorescence
   parameters suggested significant variations in DOM composition within a
   specific study area, on both spatial and temporal scales. There was no
   correlation between DOC concentration and any DOM quality parameter,
   illustrating that comparing across biomes, large variations in DOM
   quality are not necessarily associated with corresponding large ranges
   in DOC concentrations. The data presented here emphasize that optical
   properties of DOM can be highly variable and controlled by different
   physical (e. g., hydrology), chemical (e. g., photoreactivity/redox
   conditions), and biological (e. g., primary productivity) processes, and
   as such can have important ecological consequences. This study
   demonstrates that relatively simple DOM absorbance and/or fluorescence
   measurements can be incorporated into long-term ecological research and
   monitoring programs, resulting in advanced understanding of organic
   matter dynamics in aquatic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Diatom blooms are frequently terminated by mass aggregation of cells
   into large, rapidly sinking aggregates. It has been hypothesized that
   transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), abundant particles formed from
   the polysaccharides exuded by living cells, may be essential for this
   mass flocculation processes. We investigated the abundance of TEP and
   their role in the aggregation of diatoms in laboratory cultures and
   during a natural diatom bloom off California. TEP and dissolved
   carbohydrates accumulated appreciably over the growth cycle of
   Chaetoceros gracilis in the laboratory. The flocculation of C. gracilis
   in a laboratory flocculator was dominated by TEP, not cells, and large
   flocs, consisting predominantly of particulate polysaccharides, formed
   at a rate more than an order of magnitude higher than predicted by
   coagulation theory for cells alone. The frequency of interparticle
   attachment was three orders of magnitude higher for TEP than for cells.
   The pattern of flocculation of a natural diatom bloom was similar to
   that of laboratory cultures. Prior to bloom flocculation the abundance
   and total quantity of TEP and the concentration of particulate
   carbohydrates increased, while dissolved carbohydrate concentrations
   decreased. During the flocculation stage TEP aggregated into fewer, but
   much larger particles and concentrations of dissolved carbohydrates
   decreased further. The percentage of diatom cells which were attached to
   TEP increased during the flocculation period from 3 to 90\% and TEP
   formed the matrix of all the natural diatom aggregates observed. During
   the late flocculation stage the quantity of TEP and TEP aggregates did
   not increase further and concentrations of diatoms decreased, presumably
   because large flocs sank out.
   Our findings indicate that TEP should be included in models of particle
   aggregation in the ocean. The abundance, large size and high sticking
   coefficient of TEP make them essential to the aggregation of diatom
   blooms. The extracellular release of polysaccharides by growing cells
   may be an adaptation for aggregation. The abiotic formation of
   particulate organic matter (TEP) from dissolved organic matter (DOC) may
   help to explain the extremely high turnover rates of DOC observed during
   blooms.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), also referred to as
   gelbstoff, gilvin, or yellow matter, has long been known to be an
   important component of the optical properties of coastal and estuarine
   environments. However, an understanding of the processes regulating its
   global distribution and variability, its relationship to the total pool
   of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and its influence on light
   availability remain largely unexplored. Satellite imagery from the
   Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) is used to characterize
   the global distribution of light absorption due to colored detrital and
   dissolved materials (CDM). The quantity CDM is considered as it is not
   yet possible to differentiate CDOM and detrital particulate absorption
   from ocean color spectra on a routine basis. Nonetheless, analysis of an
   extensive field data set indicates that detrital particulates make only
   a small contribution to CDM. A comparison of coincident field
   observations of CDM with SeaWiFS retrievals shows good agreement,
   indicating that the present procedures perform well. To first order, the
   basin-scale CDM distribution reflects patterns of wind-driven vertical
   circulation of the gyres modulated by a meridional trend of increasing
   CDM toward higher latitudes. The global CDM distribution appears
   regulated by a coupling of biological, photochemical, and physical
   oceanographic processes all acting on a local scale, and greater than
   50\% of blue light absorption is controlled by CDM. Significant
   differences in both CDM concentration and its contribution to blue light
   absorption are found spatially among the major ocean basins and
   temporally on variety of timescales. Significant impacts of riverine
   discharges can be discerned, although their effects are largely
   localized. Basin-scale distributions of CDM and DOC are largely
   unrelated, indicating that CDM is a small and highly variable fraction
   of the global DOC pool. This first view of the global CDM distribution
   opens many new doors for the quantification of global marine
   photoprocesses using satellite ocean color data.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in spectroscopic techniques have led to an increase in the use
   of optical properties (absorbance and fluorescence) to assess dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) composition and infer sources and processing.
   However, little information is available to assess the impact of
   biological and photolytic processing on the optical properties of
   original DOM source materials. Over a 3.5 month laboratory study, we
   measured changes in commonly used optical properties and indices in DOM
   leached from peat soil, plants, and algae following biological and
   photochemical degradation to determine whether they provide unique
   signatures that can be linked to original DOM source. Changes in
   individual optical parameters varied by source material and process,
   with biodegradation and photodegradation often causing values to shift
   in opposite directions. Although values for different source materials
   frequently overlapped, multivariate statistical analyses showed that
   unique optical signatures could be linked to original DOM source
   material, with 17 optical properties determined by discriminant analysis
   to be significant (p < 0.05) in distinguishing between DOM source and
   environmental processing. These results demonstrate that inferring
   source material from optical properties is possible when parameters are
   evaluated in combination even after extensive biological and
   photochemical alteration.}},

Abstract = {{Riverine organic matter supports of the order of one-fifth of estuarine
   metabolism(1). Coastal ecosystems are therefore sensitive to alteration
   of both the quantity and lability of terrigenous dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) delivered by rivers. The lability of DOM is thought to vary
   with age, with younger, relatively unaltered organic matter being more
   easily metabolized by aquatic heterotrophs than older, heavily modified
   material(2-4). This view is developed exclusively from work in
   watersheds where terrestrial plant and soil sources dominate streamwater
   DOM. Here we characterize streamwater DOM from 11 coastal watersheds on
   the Gulf of Alaska that vary widely in glacier coverage (0-64 per cent).
   In contrast to non-glacial rivers, we find that the bioavailability of
   DOM to marine microorganisms is significantly correlated with increasing
   C-14 age. Moreover, the most heavily glaciated watersheds are the source
   of the oldest (similar to 4 kyr C-14 age) and most labile (66 per cent
   bioavailable) DOM. These glacial watersheds have extreme runoff rates,
   in part because they are subject to some of the highest rates of glacier
   volume loss on Earth(5). We estimate the cumulative flux of dissolved
   organic carbon derived from glaciers contributing runoff to the Gulf of
   Alaska at 0.13 +/- 0.01 Tg yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12) g), of which similar to
   0.10 Tg is highly labile. This indicates that glacial runoff is a
   quantitatively important source of labile reduced carbon to marine
   ecosystems. Moreover, because glaciers and ice sheets represent the
   second largest reservoir of water in the global hydrologic system, our
   findings indicate that climatically driven changes in glacier volume
   could alter the age, quantity and reactivity of DOM entering coastal
   oceans.}},

Abstract = {{Aldose, amino acid, and elemental compositions were determined for
   flux-weighted samples of coarse (>63 mum) and fine (<63 mum) particulate
   organic material and ultrafiltered (>1,000 Daltons) dissolved organic
   matter collected at three sites along the Brazilian Amazon River and six
   of its major tributaries. Concentrations of total organic C (TOC) were
   relatively uniform (550 +/- 100 muM) at all sites, with DOC comprising
   the major (50-100\%) component. An average of 77\% of the total DOC was
   isolated by ultrafiltration.
   The greatest compositional differences observed in the Amazon River
   system were among the coarse, fine, and dissolved organic fractions. All
   coarse particulate fractions were nitrogen-poor (atomic C:N = 21) and
   exhibited stable carbon isotope, aldose, and amino acid compositions
   similar to those of angiosperm tree leaves. Coarse particulate organic
   materials, although the least degraded of the three fractions, had lost
   appreciable carbohydrate and had immobilized excess nitrogen of apparent
   bacterial origin. Fine particulate materials were more nitrogen-rich
   (C:N = 9) than coarse counterparts and had lower total aldose yields and
   glucose percentages. Fine particles gave greater total yields of amino
   acids, characterized by high ratios of basic vs. acidic components.
   Coexisting dissolved organic materials recovered by ultrafiltration were
   nitrogen-poor (C:N = 27-52) and yielded the lowest amounts of aldoses,
   among which deoxy sugars were concentrated. Dissolved fractions gave
   extremely low yields of amino acids in mixtures that were enriched in
   nonprotein components and in acidic vs. basic molecules. These yield and
   composition patterns are consistent with a `'regional chromatography''
   model in which highly degraded leaf material is solubilized and then
   partitioned between soil minerals and water during transport to the
   river, resulting in suspended fine particulate organic materials of soil
   origin that are nitrogen-rich and coexisting dissolved organic
   substances that are nitrogen-poor.}},

Title = {{THE UPTAKE OF INORGANIC NUTRIENTS BY HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA}},

Abstract = {{It is now well known that heterotrophic bacteria account for a large
   portion of total uptake of both phosphate (60\% median) and ammonium
   (30\% median) in freshwaters and marine environments. Less clear are the
   factors controlling relative uptake by bacteria, and the consequences of
   this uptake on the plankton community and biogeochemical processes,
   e.g., new production. Some of the variation in reported inorganic
   nutrient uptake by bacteria is undoubtedly due to methodological
   problems, but even so, uptake would be expected to vary because of
   variation in several parameters, perhaps the most interesting being
   dissolved organic matter. Uptake of ammonium by bacteria is very low
   whereas uptake of dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) is high in eutrophic
   estuaries (the Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay). The concentrations and
   turnover of DFAA are insufficient, however, in oligotrophic oceans where
   bacteria turn to ammonium and nitrate, although the latter only as a
   last resort. I argue here that high uptake of dissolved organic carbon,
   which has been questioned, is necessary to balance the measured uptake
   of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in seawater culture experiments.
   What is problematic is that this DIN uptake exceeds bacterial biomass
   production. One possibility is that bacteria excrete dissolved organic
   nitrogen (DON). A recent study offers some support for this hypothesis.
   Lysis by viruses would also release DON.
   While ammonium uptake by heterotrophic bacteria has been hypothesized to
   affect phytoplankton community structure, other impacts on the
   phytoplankton and biomass production (both total and new) are less clear
   and need further work. Also, even though bacteria account for a very
   large fraction of phosphate uptake, how this helps to structure the
   plankton community has not been examined. What is clear is that the
   interactions between bacterial and phytoplankton uptake of inorganic
   nutrients are more complicated than simple competition.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence-based observations provide useful, sensitive information
   concerning the nature and distribution of colored dissolved organic
   matter (CDOM) in coastal and freshwater environments. The
   excitation-emission matrix (EEM) technique has become widely used for
   evaluating sources and sinks of CDOM. Water scattering peaks, however,
   can create problems for quantitative analysis and display of the EEMs,
   especially for samples with low CDOM concentrations. Here we report a
   new method for eliminating Rayleigh and Raman scatter peaks from EEMs
   during post-processing of the data in MATLAB(R). An algorithm was
   developed to excise scatter peaks (i.e. peak emission +/-10 - 15 nm at
   each excitation wavelength) from the scan data and replace the excised
   values using three-dimensional interpolation of the remaining data
   (Delaunay triangulation method). The interpolated surface was
   constrained to pass through the non-excised values so that only data in
   excised portions were replaced. Tests of the algorithm in non-scatter
   regions indicate expected deviations of 0-4\% for interpolated regions
   of DOM fluorescence peaks (i.e. difference between measured and
   interpolated intensity after removal/interpolation), which is within
   machine error for the primary observations. This new scattering
   correction method is shown to provide much improved results in the
   quantitative analysis of EEMs compared to the conventional
   blank-subtraction procedure. The method is used to process EEMs and
   fluorescence quantum yields for water samples obtained along a salinity
   transect in a river located on the coast of the southeastern United
   States. Results of this analysis demonstrate observed shifts in EEM peak
   positions along most of the transect cannot be accounted for by a simple
   model that computes EEMs as a function of salinity assuming that the
   dominant driver of EEM spectral change is mixing between riverine and
   marine waters within the estuary. Other results show that fluorescence
   apparent quantum yields (AQYs) increased with increasing salinity and pH
   in the estuary and that the highest quantum yields are observed on
   excitation by 350-380-nm light. Modeling results and the observed EEM
   spectral changes indicate that photoreactions had an important effect on
   the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) optical properties in
   the estuary. The increase in fluorescence quantum yields with increasing
   salinity and pH in the estuary likely were caused by reactions involving
   magnesium or hydroxide ions that reduced fluorescence quenching by
   chelated iron and possibly other paramagnetic ions. The results of the
   study indicate that EEM analysis with careful scatter correction can
   provide a powerful tool for evaluating pathways for carbon cycling in
   estuaries. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Mass spectrometry has recently played a key role in the understanding of
   natural organic matter (NOM) by providing molecular-level details about
   its composition. NOM, a complex assemblage of organic molecules present
   in natural waters and soils/sediments, has the ability to bind and
   transport anthropogenic materials. An improved understanding of its
   composition is crucial in order to understand how pollutants interact
   with NOM and how NOM cycles through global carbon cycles. In the past,
   low-resolution (> 3000) mass analyzers have offered some insights into
   the structure of NOM, but emerging ultrahigh resolution (> 200000)
   techniques such as electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled to Fourier
   transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) have
   significantly advanced our knowledge of NOM chemistry. Here, a review of
   the recent literature on the advancements of NOM characterization and
   the applications of mass spectrometry to this central task is presented.
   Various methods for the analysis and display of the extremely complex
   mass spectra, such as the van Krevelen diagram and Kendrick mass defect
   analysis, are discussed. We also review tandem mass spectrometry
   techniques employed to gain structural information about NOM components.
   Finally, we show how ESI-FT-ICR-MS has been applied to examine specific
   issues that are important to the NOM scientific community, such as NOM
   reactivity, transport and fate, degradation, and existence of
   components, which are indicators of NOM origin. In general, ultrahigh
   resolution provided by FT-ICR-MS is essential for the complete
   separation of the thousands of peaks present in the complex NOM mixture
   and will clearly lead to additional future advancements in the areas of
   aquatic, soil, and analytical chemistry. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley

Abstract = {{DISSOLVED organic material in marine and freshwater ecosystems
   constitutes one of the Earth's largest actively cycled reservoirs for
   organic matter(1). The bacterially mediated turnover of chemically
   identifiable, low-molecular-mass components of this pool has been
   studied in detail for nearly three decades, but these compounds
   constitute less than 20\% of the total reservoir(2). In contrast, little
   is known about the fate of the larger, biologically more refractory
   molecules-including humic substances-which make up the bulk of dissolved
   organic matter. Here we report results from bacterial bioassays and
   photochemical studies indicating that exposure to sunlight causes
   dissolved organic matter to release nitrogen-rich compounds that are
   biologically available, thus enhancing the bacterial degradation of
   humic substances. We demonstrate that ammonium is among the nitrogenous
   compounds released and is produced most efficiently by ultraviolet
   wavelengths. Photochemical release of ammonium from dissolved organic
   matter has important implications for nitrogen availability in many
   aquatic ecosystems, including nitrogen-limited high-latitude
   environments and coastal oceans, where inputs of terrestrial humic

Abstract = {{Bacterial growth and the chemical composition of dissolved organic

   similar to 30\% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was used by
   bacteria, indicating the highly reactive nature of this fresh DOM. Over
   half of the DOC consumption was accounted for as losses of combined
   neutral sugars and amino acids. The initial composition of the DOM was
   characterized by high neutral sugar (14\% DOG) and amino acid (7.4\%
   DOG) yields and the dominance of glucose (similar to 75 mol\%) and
   glutamic acid (similar to 25 mol\%). During microbial degradation the
   neutral sugar and amino acid yields decreased, and the molecular
   composition of the DOM became more uniform. The relatively constant
   abundance of D amino acids and the dramatic changes in the neutral sugar
   and amino acid compositions indicated that bacteria were important in
   shaping the chemical composition of marine DOM by selectively removing

Abstract = {{Eight field campaigns in the eutrophic, shallow, Lake Taihu in the
   summers from 2005 to 2007, and a phytoplankton degradation experiment of
   33 days, were carried out to determine the contribution of phytoplankton
   degradation to CDOM. Significant and positive correlations were found
   between the CDOM absorption coefficient at 355 nm {[}a(CDOM)(355)],
   normalized fluorescence emission (QSU) at 450 nm from excitation at 355
   nm {[}F-n(355)], and the chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration for all
   eight field campaigns, which indicates that the decomposition and
   degradation of phytoplankton is an important source of CDOM. In the
   degradation experiment, the CDOM absorption coefficient increased as
   phytoplankton broke down during the first 12 days, showing the
   production of CDOM from phytoplankton. After 12 days, a(CDOM)(355) had
   increased from the initial value 0.41 +/- 0.03 m(-1) to 1.37 +/- 0.03
   m(-1) (a 234\% increase), and the Chla concentration decreased from the
   initial value of 349.1 +/- 11.2 mu g/L to 30.4 +/- 13.2 mu g/L (a 91.3\%
   decrease). The mean daily production rate of CDOM from phytoplankton was
   0.08 m(-1) for a(CDOM) (355). Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) was
   used to assess CDOM composition from EEM spectra, and four components
   were identified: a terrestrial-like humic component, two marine-like
   humic components, and a protein-like component. The rapid increase in
   marine-like humic fluorophores (C3 and C4) during the degradation
   experiment suggests that in situ production of CDOM plays an important
   role in the dynamics of CDOM. The field campaigns and experimental data
   in the present study show that phytoplankton can be one of the important
   CDOM producers in eutrophic shallow lakes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Organic carbon dissolved in sea water is an important component of the
   global carbon cycle(1). Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   in the ocean's surface mixed layer are at least twice those in the deep
   sea(2,3), because of the production of soluble carbon compounds by
   marine algae in the euphotic zone(4,5). But very little is known about
   the chemical composition of DOC, and the connection between
   photosynthetic production and DOC accumulation is not well
   understood(6,7). Here we report the chemical characterization of
   macromolecular DOC at several sites in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
   Neutral sugars, acetate and lipids show similar distributions,
   suggesting that these constituents are linked together in a common
   macromolecular structure. Chemical linkage patterns between the
   oligosaccharide portions of dissolved organic matter subjected to
   ultrafiltration are highly specific, with little variation between ocean
   basins. We show that laboratory culture experiments on the decomposition
   of algal exudate produce macromolecular organic matter with similar
   compositions and linkage characteristics. We propose that a significant
   fraction of DOC in sea surface water consists of structurally related
   and biosynthetically derived acyl oligosaccharides that persist after
   more labile organic matter has been degraded.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, electrospray ionization coupled to Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) is utilized to
   molecularly characterize DOM as it is transported along a river to
   estuary to ocean transect of the lower Chesapeake Bay system. The
   ultrahigh resolving power (greater than 500,000) and mass accuracy of
   FTICR-MS allow for the resolution of the thousands of components in a
   single DOM sample, and can therefore elucidate the molecular-level
   changes that occur during DOM transformation from a terrestrial location
   to the marine environment. An important feature of FTICR-MS is that its
   sensitivity allows for direct analysis of low salinity samples without
   employing the traditional concentration approaches involving C-18
   extraction or ultrafiltration. To evaluate the advantages of using
   direct analysis, a C-18 extract of riverine water is compared to its
   whole, unfractionated water, and it was determined that the C-18
   extraction is selective in that it eliminates two major series of
   compounds. One group is aliphatic amines/amides that are not adsorbed to
   the C-18 disk because they exist as positive ions prior to extraction.
   The second group is tannin-like compounds with higher oxygen contents
   and a more polar quality that also allow them not to be adsorbed to the
   C-18 disk. This direct approach could not be used for brackish/saline
   waters, so the C-18 method is resorted to for those samples. Along the
   subject transect, a significant difference is observed in the molecular
   composition of DOM, as determined from assigned molecular formulas. The
   DOM tends to become more aliphatic and contain lower abundances of
   oxygen-rich molecules as one progresses from inshore to the offshore. A
   considerable amount of molecular formula overlap does exist between
   samples from sites along the transect. This can be explained as either
   the presence of refractory material that persists throughout the
   transect, due to its resistance to degradation, or that the assigned
   molecular formulas are the same but the chemical structures are
   different. ESI-FTICR-MS is a powerful technique for the investigation of
   DOM and has the ability to detect compositional variations along the
   river to ocean transect. Visualization tools such as two dimensional and
   three dimensional van Krevelen diagrams greatly assist in highlighting
   the shift from the more aromatic, terrestrial DOM to the more aliphatic,
   marine DOM. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Seawater cultures were used to study seasonal and diel variations in
   bacterial growth and nutrient availability. In both the Baltic Sea and
   the Northeast Mediterranean, the least available component for bacterial
   growth was phosphorus. In the Baltic Sea, carbon was available in excess
   for bacterial growth on all sampling occasions. Compared to the
   controls, additions of nonlimiting concentrations of inorganic nitrogen
   and phosphorus increased the yield of bacteria compared to the control
   with 156\% and the degradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by 64\%
   (as determined by high temperature catalytic oxidation), Analogous,
   bacterial growth yield increased along with an accumulation of inorganic
   nutrients in diel experiments with an intact foodweb (microcosm). The
   concentration of utilizable carbon (UC) was determined from bacterial
   consumption of DOC in seawater cultures during non-limiting nutrient
   conditions. Utilizable phosphorus (UP) and utilizable nitrogen (UN) were
   calculated by converting the bacterial biomass in the cultures into
   phosphorus and nitrogen equivalents. In the Baltic the average
   concentrations of UC, UN and UP were found to be 23 muM C, 0.6 muM N and
   0.03 muM P respectively. Heterotrophic bacteria preferentially utilized
   inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus to support growth on a short time
   scale (days). Bacterial carbon content decreased as a result of nutrient
   additions from 51 +/- 7 to 32 +/- 5 fg C cell-1. Growth efficiencies
   varied from 11 to 54\% in untreated cultures compared to 14 to 58\% in

Abstract = {{The enigma of aerobic vs, anaerobic decomposition in marine sediments
   was addressed by means of a thin-layer incubation technique. Two
   different C-14-labeled plant materials, aged diatoms (Skeletonema
   costatum) and fresh barley hay, were each mixed into intertidal sediment
   and spread in a 1.5-mm layer on the bottom of oxic and anoxic chambers.
   After a 27-d incubation, conditions in all chambers were switched from
   aerobic to anaerobic and vice versa for 11 d. Rates of (CO2)-C-14
   evolution in diatom chambers showed that aerobic carbon mineralization
   was similar to 10 times faster than anaerobic both before and after the
   switch. Low rates of {[}C-14]DOC release suggested that the limiting
   step of anaerobic decay was the initial hydrolytic and fermentative
   enzymatic attack on the predecomposed diatoms. Initial carbon
   mineralization of barley hay was not affected by the presence or absence
   of oxygen. Leaching of DOC from the fresh barley hay supplied anaerobic
   respirers with labile substrates. When leaching ceased and after the
   aerobic-anaerobic switch, the rate of anaerobic mineralization was
   reduced. Mineralization of leachable and easily hydrolyzable compounds
   from fresh plant detritus is equally fast under aerobic and anaerobic
   conditions. When structural components dominate the particulate remains,
   anaerobic processes are hampered by inefficient and slow bacterial
   hydrolysis of structurally complex macromolecules.}},

Abstract = {{The sources and distribution of organic matter (OM) in surface waters
   and sediments from Winyah Bay (South Carolina, USA) were investigated
   using a variety of analytical techniques, including elemental, stable
   isotope and organic biomarker analyses. Several locations along the
   estuary salinity gradient were sampled during four different periods of
   contrasting river discharge and tidal ranee. The dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) concentrations of surface waters ranged from 7 mg l(-1) in
   the lower bay stations closest to the ocean to 20 mg l(-1) in the river
   and upper bay samples. There was a general linear relationship between
   DOC concentrations and salinity in three of the four sampling periods.
   In contrast, particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations were
   significantly lower (0.1-3 mg l(-1)) and showed no relationship with
   salinity. The high molecular weight dissolved OM (HMW DOM) isolated from
   selected water samples collected along the bay displayed atomic carbon:
   nitrogen ratios ({[}C/N]a) and stable carbon isotopic compositions of
   organic carbon (delta(13)C(OC)) that ranged from 10 to 30 and from -28
   to -25parts per thousand, respectively. Combined, such compositions
   indicate that in most HMW DOM samples, the majority of the OM originates
   from terrigenous sources, with smaller contributions from riverine and
   estuarine phytoplankton. In contrast, the {[}C/N]a ratios of particulate
   OM (POM) samples varied significantly among the collection periods,
   ranging from low values of similar to5 to high values of >20. Overall,
   the trends in {[}C/N]a ratios indicated that algal sources of POM were
   most important during the early and late summer, whereas terrigenous
   sources dominated in the winter and early spring.
   In Winyah Bay bottom sediments, the concentrations of the
   mineral-associated OM were positively correlated with sediment surface
   area. The {[}C/N]a ratios and delta(13)C(OC) compositions of the bulk
   sedimentary OM ranged from 5 to 45 and from -28 to -23parts per
   thousand, respectively. These compositions were consistent with
   predominant contributions of terrigenous sources and lesser (but
   significant) inputs of freshwater, estuarine and marine phytoplankton.
   The highest terrigenous contents were found in sediments from the river
   and upper bay sites, with smaller contributions to the lower parts of
   the estuary. The yields of lignin-derived CuO oxidation products from
   Winyah Bay sediments indicated that the terrigenous OM in these samples
   was composed of variable mixtures of relatively fresh vascular plant
   detritus and moderately altered soil OM. Based on the lignin phenol
   compositions, most of this material appeared to be derived from
   angiosperm and gymnosperm vascular plant sources similar to those found
   in the upland coastal forests in this region. A few samples displayed
   lignin compositions that suggested a more significant contribution from
   marsh C-3 grasses. However, there was no evidence of inputs of Spartina
   alterniflora (a C-4 grass) remains from the salt marshes that surround
   the lower sections of Winyah Bay. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{THERE is evidence that the potentially harmful solar ultraviolet-B
   (UV-B, 280-320 mm) radiation penetrates much deeper into the ocean's
   water column than previously thought1,2. UV-B radiation is also
   responsible for photochemical degradation of refractory macromolecules
   into biologically labile organic compounds3,4. It thus seems reasonable
   to assume that UV-B radiation might influence the cycling of organic
   matter in the sea, which is believed to be largely mediated by
   bacterioplankton5. Here we report that bacterioplankton activity in the
   surface layers of the oceans is suppressed by solar radiation by about
   40\% in the top 5 m of the water column in nearshore waters, whereas in
   oligotrophic open oceans suppression might be detectable to a depth of
   >10 m. Bacterioplankton from near-surface (0.5 m depth) waters of a
   highly stratified water column were as sensitive to surface UV-B
   radiation as subpycnocline bacteria, indicating no adaptative mechanisms
   against surface solar radiation in near-surface bacterioplankton
   consortia. Surface solar radiation levels also photochemically degrade
   bacterial extracellular enzymes. Thus elevated UV-B radiation due to the
   destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer might lead to reduced
   bacterial activity and accompanying increased concentration of labile
   dissolved organic matter in the surface layers of the ocean as bacterial
   uptake of this is retarded.}},

Abstract = {{A cross-system comparison of organic carbon origin and behaviour in nine
   European estuaries is presented. The study sites display a very large
   range of hydrological and environmental conditions. The watershed of the
   respective estuaries were characterized by plotting the total organic
   carbon (TOC) in the rivers versus the inhabitants/discharge ratio, This
   allows to distinguish four types of watershed with regard to
   anthropogenic forcing and organic carbon levels: polluted by sewage
   inputs (Scheldt and to a much lesser extent, Ems, Sado and Thames),
   decontaminated (Elbe and Rhine), pristine (Gironde and Douro) and
   eutrophized (Loire and Scheldt).
   In the estuarine zone, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) almost always
   decreased linearly with increasing salinity. Exceptions were: the
   Scheldt, where a net consumption of sewage-derived DOC was observed, the
   Gironde, where a net production of DOC occurred in the maximum turbidity
   zone (MTZ) and the Sado and Ems, where DOC was supplied from large
   intertidal areas. By contrast, a large fraction of the riverine
   particulate organic carbon (POC) was mineralized in all the estuaries,
   except the Douro, where residence time of waters is only a few days. A
   fraction of POC appeared however refractory and accumulated in the MTZs,
   where terrestrial soil-derived material dominates (Elbe, Ems, Loire,
   Gironde and Sado). In the marine regions of most estuaries,
   autochthonous POC was present during spring and summer.
   The analysis of all river and estuarine data allows estimation of the
   loss of continental POC occurring in each estuary. It decreases in the
   following order: Scheldt much greater than Thames > Ems = Sado = Loire >
   Gironde > Elbe > Rhine > Douro, which almost corresponds to the
   anthropogenic pressure in the respective watersheds. Two major variables
   appear to control the intensity of this mineralization: the origin of
   the POC, the lability increasing with pollution, and the residence time
   of particles in the estuarine zone. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   bacterial growth and DOC utilization using seawater culture methodology
   in combination with measurements of bacterial abundance, cell volume,
   and DOC. Bulk DOC concentrations were determined by high temperature
   combustion (HTC) analysis, which proved to be a sensitive method for
   detecting small changes in natural concentration of DOG. Measurable
   bacterial growth and DOC utilization only occurred in unamended cultures
   when initial DDC concentrations were greater than observed in the mixed
   layer at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series station. In unamended cultures
   exhibiting growth, approximately 6 to 7\% of the bulk pool was available
   and considered a labile component. This material was utilized with an
   average bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) of 14 +/- 6\%. Nutrient
   enrichment experiments were also conducted with NH4, PO4, glucose,

   experiments bacterial growth rates, bacterial carbon production, and BGE
   increased with the addition of organic carbon supplements. There were no
   enhancements of bacterial production or DOC utilization above the

   examine dissolved organic matter from 109 Swedish lakes using
   ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopy to
   investigate the constraints on its persistence in the environment. We
   find that degradation processes preferentially remove oxidized, aromatic
   compounds, whereas reduced, aliphatic and N-containing compounds are
   either resistant to degradation or tightly cycled and thus persist in
   aquatic systems. The patterns we observe for individual molecules are
   consistent with our measurements of emergent bulk characteristics of
   organic matter at wide geographic and temporal scales, as reflected by
   optical properties. We conclude that intrinsic molecular properties are
   an important control of overall organic matter reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{The present study demonstrates that the spectral slope coefficient of
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) between 275 nm and 295 nm
   (S275-295) can be used as a tracer of the percent terrigenous dissolved
   organic carbon (\%tDOC) in river-influenced ocean margins, where rivers
   exert an important control on carbon dynamics and CO2 fluxes. Absorption
   coefficients of CDOM and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) and dissolved lignin were measured on a seasonal basis in the
   Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers and in surface waters of the northern
   Gulf of Mexico (NGoM). A strong, linear relationship between lignin
   concentrations and CDOM absorption coefficients indicated lignin is an
   important chromophore in this environment. The dual nature of lignin as
   an important chromophore in CDOM and as a terrigenous component of DOC
   facilitated development of the tracer. The applicability of the tracer
   relies on the existence of a strong, nonlinear relationship between
   S275-295 and the DOC-normalized lignin yield in rivers and along the
   freshwater-marine continuum in the NGoM. Physical mixing and the effects
   of photodegradation on S275-295 and dissolved lignin were largely
   responsible for maintaining this relationship, suggesting the tracer is
   applicable to surface waters of most river-influenced ocean margins. The
   spectral slope coefficient (S275-295) provides new capabilities to trace
   tDOC on synoptic scales of relevance to ocean margins and represents an
   important tool for improving ocean carbon budgets.}},

Abstract = {{The photochemical reactivity of dissolved lignin and photobleaching of
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) were examined in riverine and open-ocean
   water samples. Approximately 75\% of the total dissolved lignin in
   Mississippi River water was lost during 28 d of incubation in sunlight,
   mostly due to photooxidation. The remaining fraction of dissolved lignin
   was much less susceptible to photooxidation. About 90\% of the dissolved
   lignin in river water was present as high-molecular-weight (HMW; >1,000
   Dalton) DOM. However, after exposure to sunlight, about 80\% of the
   remaining lignin was present as low-molecular-weight (LMW; <1,000
   Dalton) DOM. An absolute increase in concentration of LMW lignin
   provided direct evidence for the phototransformation of macromolecular
   DOM to smaller molecules. The composition of riverine dissolved lignin
   also changed dramatically during photooxidation. The abundance of
   syringyl relative to vanillyl phenols decreased twofold, while
   concentrations of vanillic acid relative to vanillin, (Ad/Al)v,
   increased fourfold. The increase in (Ad/Al)v was found exclusively in
   the photooxidized LMW DOM. The photochemically altered composition of
   riverine dissolved lignin was consistent with the composition of oceanic
   dissolved lignin. The dissolved lignin in HMW DOM from the equatorial
   Pacific Ocean was highly resistant to photooxidation. These findings
   suggest that photochemical reactions play a prominent role in
   determining the composition and reactivity of terrigenous DOM in the
   ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Recent literature indicates that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may
   accumulate in productive surface waters. Such accumulation will allow
   export of DOC to the aphotic zone by diffusion and downwelling. As an
   alternative to models based on low degradability, we here propose a
   mechanism where bacterial carbon consumption is restricted due to food
   web mechanisms controlling both growth and biomass of the bacteria:
   growth rate is kept low by bacteria-phytoplankton competition for
   mineral nutrients, and biomass is kept low by bacterial predators. With
   such a mechanism, otherwise degradable material may accumulate and
   become subject both to chemical transformation and vertical transport.
   The steady-states of a model describing the interactions between
   heterotrophic bacteria, phytoplankton, and bacterivorous protozoa is
   used to explore how the balance between DOC production and consumption
   shifts along a gradient from oligotrophy to eutrophy.}},

Abstract = {{Photo-oxidation of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) to inorganic carbon
   (DIG) in five oligotrophic south Swedish lakes of different humic
   content (3.9-19 mg DOC liter(-1), 0-140 mg Pt liter(-1), Secchi depth
   7.6-1.5 m) was investigated. Sterile-filtered (0.2 mu m) water was
   incubated in UV-transparent quartz tubes and in tubes covered with
   aluminum foil. Samples were incubated at different depths (0, 0.20,
   0.65, and 2.00 m) from sunrise to sunset (0400 to 2200 hours) in July.
   Inorganic C was measured before and after incubation. Total plankton
   respiration in unfiltered lake-water (production of DIG) was also
   measured. At the surface, photo-oxidative DIC production was 86-410 mg C
   m(-3) d(-1), while plankton community respiration was 101-274 mg C m(-3)
   d(-1). Photo-oxidation integrated over depth was 44-171 mg C m(-2)
   d(-1), while respiration was 201-547 mg C m(-2) d(-1) to a depth of 2 m
   and 398-850 mg C m(-2) d(-1) over the depth of the epilimnion.
   Depth-integrated photo-oxidation was independent of water color or DOC
   concentration in the lakes. Photooxidation was detected deeper than the
   penetration of UV-B radiation, indicating that longer wavelengths (UV-A
   and possibly PAR) are also active. DIC production was linearly related
   to loss of fluorescence (excitation 355 nm, emission 455 nm) in
   light-incubated samples. Our study shows that photo-oxidation of DOC may
   be an important process causing the regularly observed supersaturation
   of DIC in lakes.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular level characterizations of dissolved lignin were conducted in
   Mississippi River plume waters to study the impact of various removal
   mechanisms (photooxidation, microbial degradation, and flocculation) on
   dissolved organic material (DOM) concentrations and compositions. Prior
   to analysis, dissolved (<0.2-mu m pore size) samples were size
   fractionated by ultrafiltration into high molecular weight (HMW; >1
   kDalton) and low molecular weight (LMW; <1 kDalton) components. At
   salinities <25 psu, flocculation and microbial degradation were the
   primary factors affecting lignin concentrations. At salinities >25 psu,
   photooxidation was a dominant factor influencing lignin compositions and
   concentrations. Diagnostic indicators of photooxidation include a sharp
   decrease in the percentage of lignin in the HMW size fraction, changes
   in ratios of syringyl to vanillyl phenols, and increases in LMW acid:
   aldehyde ratios for both vanillyl and syringyl phenols. A 10-day
   incubation experiment with plume water indicated rates of microbial
   degradation of dissolved lignin that were similar to30\% of
   photooxidation rates in surface waters. These results highlight the
   importance of microbial as well as photochemical processes in the
   cycling of terrigenous DOM in coastal waters. Neither flocculation nor
   microbial degradation significantly altered lignin composition,
   suggesting that composition is primarily determined by source and
   photochemical transformation. Overall, high removal rates indicate the
   potential importance of terrigenous DOM as a carbon and nutrient source
   in the coastal ocean. Strong correlations between absorption
   coefficients at 350 nm and dissolved lignin demonstrate the potential
   for using absorption to trace terrigenous DOM in coastal environments
   with significant riverine input.}},

Abstract = {{Batch cultures of Chaetoceros affinis grown under nitrogen- (N:P = 5)

   higher rates of photosynthetic extracellular release (PER),
   respectively, than C. affinis grown under balanced nutrient conditions
   (N:P = 16). Inoculations of natural bacterial assemblages to PER derived
   from phytoplankton grown under these different nutrient regimes
   exhibited highest potential bacterial growth yields (similar to 46 \%)
   on PER derived from balanced growth. Analysis of the dissolved monomeric
   (MCHO) and polymeric (PCHO) carbohydrate pool and of the dissolved free
   amino acid (DFAA) fraction of the PER indicated significantly higher
   specific release rates of these components for phytoplankton grown under
   P limitation. Based on the fluctuation of the MCHO, PCHO and DFAA pool
   in the batch cultures and on bacterial extracellular enzymatic activity
   (EEA) and bacterial growth yield we have evidence that under P-limited
   conditions bacteria are not taking up the available carbon efficiently.
   Bacteria growing on PER derived from N-limited conditions exhibited high
   bacterial alpha- and beta-glucosidase activity, while under P limitation
   low EEA was detectable. Extrapolating our results to the severely
   P-limited summer conditions of the Northern Adriatic Sea, we might
   conclude that P limitation provokes elevated PER in exponentially
   growing phytoplankton which is not utilized efficiently by the natural
   bacterial consortia. This would allow the PER to coagulate and
   eventually form mucilage.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Mississippi river
   plume were investigated during four cruises to the region in 1990-1993.
   During each cruise, large-volume water samples were collected from a
   broad salinity gradient (0-36 psu) for the determination of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and the isolation of DOM by
   tangential-now ultrafiltration. The fraction of DOC recovered by
   ultrafiltration ranged from 49\% in the river to 22\% in the Gulf of
   Mexico. The ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) was further characterized for the
   concentrations and compositions of combined neutral sugars and
   lignin-derived phenols. Concentrations of DOC ranged from 359 muM in the
   river during the summer to 65 muM in surface waters of the Gulf of
   Mexico during the winter. Mixing curves indicated minor losses of DOC at
   low salinities and a major source of DOC at mid salinities. Combined
   neutral sugars had elevated concentrations at mid salinities where
   plankton biomass and rates of autotrophic and heterotrophic processes
   were maximal, indicating that elevated concentrations of sugars and DOC
   were freshly-derived from plankton. In contrast, concentrations of
   lignin phenols ill UDOM were depicted at low salinities, indicating
   losses due to flocculation of terrestrially-derived humic substances.
   The selective removal of syringyl phenols from dissolved lignin was
   observed in UDOM from higher salinity (> 25 psu) waters, providing the
   first molecular evidence of the removal of terrigenous DOM from the
   coastal ocean due to photooxidation. Together, these molecular
   biomarkers indicated much greater dynamic behavior of DOM than was
   apparent from bulk DOC analyses, and they demonstrated that biological
   as well as physico-chemical processes were important in controlling the
   concentrations and compositions of DOM in coastal waters. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Pseudo-nitzschia is a globally distributed diatom genus, some species of
   which produce domoic acid (DA), the neurotoxin that causes amnesic
   shellfish poisoning. This toxin killed at least three humans in 1987,
   launching numerous studies concerning the identification, distribution,
   ecology and physiology of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. Since previous reviews
   in 1998, knowledge has been gained about the fate of DA, including its
   accumulation by marine animals and its degradation by light and
   bacteria. Molecular techniques and more precise microscopy have enabled
   the description of new Pseudo-nitzschia species, 15 since 2002,
   including ones that are cryptic and pseudo-cryptic. An increasing number
   of the 37 identified species, including oceanic and coastal species,
   have been studied in laboratory culture. The sexual reproduction of 14
   species has been documented. Fourteen species have now been shown to be
   toxigenic, although some strains are not always toxic under the testing
   conditions. The biotic and abiotic factors that modify DA production are
   reviewed, with a focus on how new discoveries have changed our original
   hypotheses about control mechanisms. Recent studies confirm that
   silicate and phosphate limitation trigger DA production. However, stress
   by low concentrations of iron or high concentrations of copper are newly
   discovered triggers, suggesting a trace-metal chelation role for DA.
   Organic sources of nitrogen (urea and glutamine), as well as changes in
   pH, CO2, salinity and bacterial concentration, also enhance DA
   production. Laboratory and field studies sometimes give divergent
   results for conditions that are conducive to toxin production. Gaps in
   knowledge include further information about the whole genome of
   Pseudo-nitzschia (including sexual stages), mechanisms of DA production
   and decline, presence or absence of a resting stage, heterotrophic
   ability, impact of viruses and fungi, and a more complete description of
   the ecological and physiological roles of DA.}},

Abstract = {{The potential importance of the viral lysis of phytoplankton for
   nutrient and carbon cycling has been acknowledged, but no quantitative
   assessments of this phenomenon exist. Radiotracer experiments examined
   the release and bioavailability of C, N, P, Fe, and Se following viral
   lysis of the ``brown tide{''} chrysophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens.
   Photochemical effects on the dissolved-particulate partitioning and
   biological uptake of virally released elements were also investigated.
   Viral lysis of A. anophagefferens released 50\% mon C and Se than
   uninfected control cells to the dissolved phase, while N, P, and Fe
   remained in the particulate phase. There was a significant inverse
   correlation between A. anophagefferens and bacterial densities, as well
   as an increase in particulate organic nitrogen levels in cultures during
   viral lysis. These observations indicate that released dissolved organic
   matter supported bacterial growth and may be a pathway by which various
   elements are diverted in microbial food webs. Dissolved nutrients
   released by viral lysis were accumulated to varying degrees by natural
   assemblages of marine bacteria and cultured diatoms, and vitally
   regenerated N and P relieved diatom nutrient limitation. During a 4-wk
   incubation, 80\% of C and P within cell lysis debris was released to the
   dissolved phase, likely due to bacterial activity. Photochemical
   degradation of cell lysis debris enhanced dissolved levels of Se (100\%)
   and Fe (50\%) and reduced total dissolved C by 15\%. Photochemistry
   doubled the bioavailability of virally released Se to diatoms, while
   decreasing the bioavailability of C to bacteria threefold. The viral
   lysis of an A. anophagefferens bloom in the field could release 40 mu M
   dissolved organic carbon and rapidly transfer other released elements to
   bacteria. Such occurrences may significantly affect water column
   chemistry, species composition, and succession within marine plankton
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between photochemical and biological processes in the
   degradation of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated
   with seawater from a coastal southeastern U.S. salt marsh. Seawater
   supplemented with humic substances was exposed to alternating cycles of
   sunlight (equivalent to 8 h of midday sun) and dark incubations with
   natural bacterial populations (1-2 weeks in length). Photochemical
   degradation of the DOM was monitored during sunlight exposure by direct
   measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and carbon monoxide
   (CO) formation in 0.2-mu m filtered seawater. Bacterial degradation was
   monitored during dark incubations by tritiated leucine uptake and
   changes in bacterial numbers in bacterivore-free incubations and by
   direct measurements of DOM loss. The alternating cycles of sunlight and
   microbial activity resulted in more complete degradation of bulk DOM and
   marine humic substances than was found for nonirradiated controls (i.e.
   with microbial activity alone) by a factor of up to 3-fold. Increased
   decomposition was due both to direct losses of carbon gas photoproducts
   (DIC and CO in a 15:1 ratio) and to enhanced microbial degradation of
   photodegraded DOM, with approximately equal contributions from each
   pathway. Mass balance calculations indicated that low-molecular-weight
   carbon photoproducts, currently considered to be the compounds
   responsible for stimulating bacterial activity following
   photodegradation of DOM, were insufficient to account for the enhanced
   bacterial production observed. Thus, higher molecular weight, chemically
   uncharacterized fractions of DOM may also be modified to more
   biologically available forms during exposure to natural sunlight.}},

Abstract = {{Using tangential-flow ultrafiltration and solid-state P-31 nuclear
   magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the dominant compound classes of
   marine high-molecular weight (1-100-nm size fraction) dissolved organic
   phosphorus (DOP) have been characterized in 16 samples from the Pacific
   Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the North Sea. NMR spectra of
   ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter (UDOM) from all sites and depths
   reveal that P esters (75\%) and phosphonates (25\%) are the major
   components of ultrafiltered DOP (UDOP). P esters and phosphonates are
   present in unchanging proportions throughout the ocean. The homogeneity
   of UDOP from different oceanic regions suggests that processes leading
   to this chemical composition are ubiquitous. Ultrafiltered particulate
   organic matter (UPOM; 0.1-60-mum size fraction) samples from the Pacific
   Ocean and the North Sea were also analyzed using P-31 NMR. In these
   samples, P esters are the only P compound class measured. Differences in
   the observed chemical compound classes of UDOM versus UPOM may result
   from (1) less-reactive phosphonates accumulating relative to P esters as
   particulate organic matter (POM) decomposes to DOM or (2) phosphonates
   originating from another source. C:N:P ratios of UDOM are significantly
   higher than Redfield ratios for POM. In general, C:P and N:P ratios of
   UDOM double between surface waters and the deep ocean. Increasing C:P

Abstract = {{Proteorhodopsins are light-dependent proton pumps that are predicted to
   have an important role in the ecology of the oceans by supplying energy
   for microbial metabolism(1,2). Proteorhodopsin genes were first
   discovered through the cloning and sequencing of large genomic DNA
   fragments from seawater(1). They were later shown to be widely
   distributed, phylogenetically diverse, and active in the oceans(3-7).
   Proteorhodopsin genes have not been found in cultured bacteria, and on
   the basis of environmental sequence data, it has not yet been possible
   to reconstruct the genomes of uncultured bacterial strains that have
   proteorhodopsin genes. Although the metabolic effect of proteorhodopsins
   is uncertain, they are thought to function in cells for which the
   primary mode of metabolism is the heterotrophic assimilation of
   dissolved organic carbon. Here we report that SAR11 strain HTCC1062
   ('Pelagibacter ubique')(8), the first cultivated member of the
   extraordinarily abundant SAR11 clade, expresses a proteorhodopsin gene
   when cultured in autoclaved seawater and in its natural environment, the
   ocean. The Pelagibacter proteorhodopsin functions as a light-dependent
   proton pump. The gene is expressed by cells grown in either diurnal
   light or in darkness, and there is no difference between the growth
   rates or cell yields of cultures grown in light or darkness.}},

Abstract = {{The photo- and bioreactive components of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   from three different environments were determined during long-term
   decomposition experiments. Terrigenous DOM was collected from a
   black-water system, plankton DOM was harvested from phytoplankton
   cultures, and lake water served as a DOM source with both terrigenous
   and plankton components. Photomineralization accounted for the removal
   of 46 and 7\% of terrigenous and lake-dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   respectively, while no loss in DOC was observed when plankton DOM was
   exposed to irradiation. Biomineralization accounted for the removal of
   27\% each of terrigenous and lake DOC and 74\% of plankton DOC.
   Phototransformations of terrigenous and lake DOM resulted in 7\% and 2\%
   increases in biodegradable DOC, respectively, while no increase in
   biodegradable DOC was observed for irradiated plankton DOM. In two
   different experimental approaches, terrigenous DOM was exposed to
   sequential and alternating bio- and photodegradation, respectively, to
   determine the fractions of DOC that were bioreactive and photoreactive.
   About 15\% of terrigenous DOC was susceptible to both biomineralization
   and photomineralization. These results demonstrate that biological and
   photochemical processes compete in the mineralization of DOC.
   Photomineralization of bioreactive DOC is likely an important factor
   determining the net effect of irradiation on the bioreactivity of DOM.}},

Abstract = {{A series of laboratory experiments was performed to measure dissolved

   production by phytoplankton was also measured. Experiments were
   performed in artificial seawater to provide a low DOC background against
   which changes in DOC concentration could be measured directly. We found
   that DOC production during grazing was high, i.e. 16-37\% of algal C
   content was released as DOC during an ingestion event. Bacterial growth
   rates were stimulated by grazer activity, most likely due to increased
   availability of labile DOG; breakage of fecal pellets by copepods may
   also have yielded DOG. In contrast, DOC production by phytoplankton was
   low, ranging from 3 to 7\% of algal C content per day. Generalizing from
   these rates, a simple budget shows that grazer DOC production should be
   4-6 times greater than phytoplankton DOC production in any region of the
   ocean where grazing is the dominant phytoplankton loss process. Both
   phytoplankton and grazer species influenced the carbohydrate composition
   of the DOC produced. Dissolved carbohydrates averaged 30 and 22\% of
   total DOC in phytoplankton-only and grazer-containing treatments,
   respectively, and most variability in carbohydrate content was due to
   variations in polysaccharide levels. We conclude that planktonic grazers
   are potentially a major source of DOC in the marine environment.}},

Abstract = {{Marine colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (also gilvin or yellow
   substance) absorbs light at an exponentially decreasing rate as a
   function of wavelength. From 410 nm to about 640 nm, particulate
   phytoplankton degradation products including pheopigments, detritus, and
   bacteria have absorption curves that are similar in shape to that of
   CDOM. In coastal areas and areas downstream from upwelling regions,
   these constituents of seawater often absorb much more light than do
   living phytoplankton, leading to errors in satellite-derived chlorophyll
   estimates as high as 133\%. Proposed NASA sensors for the 1990s will
   have spectral channels as low as 412 nm, permitting the development of
   algorithms that can separate the absorption effects of CDOM and other
   phytoplankton degradation products from those due to biologically viable
   pigments. A reflectance model has been developed to estimate chlorophyll
   a concentrations in the presence of CDOM, pheopigments, detritus, and
   bacteria. Nomograms and lookup tables have been generated to describe
   the effects of different mixtures of chlorophyll a and these degradation
   products on the R(412):R(443) and R(443):R(565) remote-sensing
   reflectance or irradiance reflectance ratios. These are used to simulate
   the accuracy of potential ocean color satellite algorithms, assuming
   that atmospheric effects have been removed. For the California Current
   upwelling and offshore regions, with chlorophyll a less-than-or-equal-to
   1.3 mg m-3, the average error for chlorophyll a retrievals derived from
   irradiance reflectance data for degradation product-rich areas was
   reduced from +/- 61\% to +/- 23\% by application of an algorithm using
   two reflectance ratios (R(412):R(443) and R(443):R(565)) rather than the
   commonly used algorithm applying a single reflectance ratio
   (R(443):R(565)).}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration and composition in riverine
   and stream systems are known to vary with hydrological and productivity
   cycles over the annual and interannual time scales. Rivers are commonly
   perceived as homogeneous with respect to DOM concentration and
   composition, particularly under steady flow conditions over short time
   periods. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of short term
   variability (<1 day) on DOM dynamics. This study examined whether
   diurnal processes measurably altered DOM concentration and composition
   in the hypereutrophic San Joaquin River (California) during a relatively
   quiescent period. We evaluated the efficacy of using optical in situ
   measurements to reveal changes in DOM which may not be evident from bulk
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurement alone. The in situ optical
   measurements described in this study clearly showed for the first time
   diurnal variations in DOM measurements, which have previously been
   related to both composition and concentration, even though diurnal
   changes were not well reflected in bulk DOC concentrations. An apparent
   asynchronous trend of DOM absorbance and chlorophyll-a in comparison to
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence and spectral
   slope S290-350 suggests that no one specific CDOM spectrophotometric
   measurement explains absolutely DOM diurnal variation in this system;
   the measurement of multiple optical parameters is therefore recommended.
   The observed diurnal changes in DOM composition, measured by in situ
   optical instrumentation likely reflect both photochemical and
   biologically-mediated processes. The results of this study highlight
   that short-term variability in DOM composition may complicate trends for
   studies aiming to distinguish different DOM sources in riverine systems
   and emphasizes the importance of sampling specific study sites to be
   compared at the same time of day. The utilization of in situ optical
   technology allows short-term variability in DOM dynamics to be monitored
   and serves to increase our understanding of its processing and
   fundamental role in the aquatic environment. Copyright (C) 2007 John

Abstract = {{A fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is able to fluoresce. This
   ability has been used in the present study to investigate the
   characteristics and distribution of different DOM fractions. A unique
   global dataset revealed seven different fluorescent fractions of DOM:
   two humic-like, four amino acid-like and one chemically uncharacterized.
   The spectral characteristics of the amino acid-like fractions resemble
   those of pure tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. The fluorescence
   intensities of these amino acid-like fractions are highest in the
   surface waters, rapidly decreasing with depth and at a constant low
   level in the bathypelagic layer. Such profiles indicate that amino
   acid-like DOM is linked to surface water production. From calibration
   curves we estimated the mean surface water concentrations of tryptophan
   and tyrosine to be 12.5 and similar to 15.9 nmol L-1, respectively,
   while mean deep water concentrations are 5.1 and similar to 6.5 nmol
   L-1. The fluorescence intensities of the humic-like DOM fractions were
   low in the surface layer, rapidly increasing in the mesopelagic layer
   and at constant high level in the bathypelagic layer. The low
   fluorescence intensities observed in the surface layer indicate the
   quantitative importance of photochemical degradation as a sink of the
   humic-like compounds. In the dark ocean (below 200 m), significant
   linear relationships between humic-like DOM fluorescence and microbial
   activity (apparent oxygen utilization. NO3- and PO43-) were found. These
   observations imply a link to dark ocean microbial remineralization and
   indicate that the major source of humic-like compounds is microbial
   turnover of organic matter. The results of the present study show that
   the distribution of the humic-like DOM fractions is a balance between
   supply from continental run off, net microbial production and
   photochemical removal in surface waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Pages = {{600-610}},
Abstract = {{Adsorption of trace metals (Ag, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn) to new
   (virgin) and aged (beached) plastic production pellets suspended in
   river water (pH similar to 6.5) has been studied under laboratory
   conditions. Over a 7-day period, reaction kinetics largely conformed to
   a pseudo-first-order reversible mechanism with forward rate constants
   that were typically at least an order of magnitude greater for beached
   pellets than virgin pellets. Adsorption isotherms were defined by a
   linear model in many cases, with maximum distribution coefficients of
   similar to 6 mL g(-1) for virgin pellets (Hg and Pb) and of the order of
   10(2) mL g(-1) for beached pellets (Ag and Pb). However, more
   significant fits to the data were obtained using Freundlich or Langmuir
   models with adsorption constants that were orders of magnitude greater
   for beached pellets than virgin pellets and, regarding the former, that
   were greatest for Ag, Hg and Pb. Increasing pH of river water resulted
   in an increase in adsorption of Ag, Cd, Co, Ni, Pb and Zn, a reduction
   in adsorption of Cr and no clear trend for Cu or Hg, and adsorption was
   always greater to beached pellets than virgin pellets. The ability of
   pellets to adsorb metals was attributed to the modification of the
   surface through the attachment of organic matter during the experiments
   and, with regard to beached pellets, their long-term pre-modification
   through photooxidation and attrition of charged material. Interactions
   at the pellet surface likely involve metal cations, oxyanions
   (HCrO4-/CrO42-) and organic complexes.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal and spatial variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   quantity and chemical composition were investigated in the Yukon River
   basin of Alaska, United States, and northwestern Canada. Dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC), chromophoric DOM (CDOM), and dissolved lignin
   phenols were measured across a range of source waters and the seasonal
   hydrograph. Strong relationships were determined between CDOM and both
   DOC and lignin phenols, highlighting the potential for deriving detailed
   spatial and temporal distributions of DOM composition from CDOM
   monitoring. Maximum concentrations of measured parameters were observed
   during the spring flush, when DOM had a remarkably high content of
   aromatic vascular plant material derived from surface soil and litter
   layers. A larger portion of riverine DOM was attributed to vascular
   plant sources than previously believed by utilizing representative
   vegetation leachates and a soil pore water as end-members. In
   combination with recent studies highlighting export of young, labile DOM
   during the spring flush in northern high-latitude river systems, our
   results suggest riverine DOM is less degraded and more labile than
   previously thought with clear ramifications for its biomineralization or
   photo-oxidation in marine environments.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that viruses play an influential role within
   the marine microbial food web. To understand this role, it is important
   to determine rates and mechanisms of virus removal and degradation, We
   used plaque assays to examine the decay of infectivity in lab-grown
   viruses seeded into natural seawater. The rates of loss of infectivity
   of native viruses from Santa Monica Bay and of nonnative viruses from
   the North Sea in the coastal seawater of Santa Monica Bay were
   determined. Viruses were seeded into fresh seawater that had been
   pretreated in various ways: filtration with a 0.2-mu m-pore-size filter
   to remove organisms, heat to denature enzymes, and dissolved organic
   matter enrichment to reconstitute enzyme activity, Seawater samples were
   then incubated in full sunlight, in the dark, or under glass to allow
   partitioning of causative agents of virus decay, Solar radiation always
   resulted in increased rates of loss of virus infectivity, Virus isolates
   which are native to Santa Monica Bay consistently degraded more slowly
   in full sunlight in untreated seawater (decay ranged from 4.1 to 7.2\%
   h(-1)) than nonnative marine bacteriophages which were isolated from the
   North Sea (decay ranged from 6.6 to 11.1\% h(-1)). All phages
   demonstrated susceptibility to degradation by heat-labile substances, as
   heat treatment reduced the decay rates to about 0.5 to 2.0\% h(-1) in
   the dark, Filtration reduced decay rates by various amounts, averaging
   20\%. Heat-labile, high-molecular-weight dissolved material (>30 kDa,
   probably enzymes) appeared responsible for about 1/5 of the maximal
   decay, Solar radiation was responsible for about 1/3 to 2/3 of the
   maximal decay of nonnative viruses and about 1/4 to 1/3 of that of the
   native viruses, suggesting evolutionary adaptation to local light
   levels. Our results suggest that sunlight is an important contributing
   factor to virus decay but also point to the significance of particles
   and dissolved substances in seawater.}},

Abstract = {{The assimilation and mineralization of dissolved organic carbon ( DOC)
   by marine bacterioplankton is a major process in the ocean carbon
   cycle(1). However, little information exists on the specific metabolic
   functions of participating bacteria and on whether individual taxa
   specialize on particular components of the marine DOC pool(2). Here we
   use experimental metagenomics to show that coastal communities are
   populated by taxa capable of metabolizing a wide variety of organic
   carbon compounds. Genomic DNA captured from bacterial community subsets
   metabolizing a single model component of the DOC pool ( either
   dimethylsulphoniopropionate or vanillate) showed substantial overlap in
   gene composition as well as a diversity of carbon- processing
   capabilities beyond the selected phenotypes. Our direct measure of niche
   breadth for bacterial functional assemblages indicates that, in
   accordance with ecological theory, heterogeneity in the composition and
   supply of organic carbon to coastal oceans may favour generalist
   bacteria. In the important interplay between microbial community
   structure and biogeochemical cycling, coastal heterotrophic communities
   may be controlled less by transient changes in the carbon reservoir that
   they process and more by factors such as trophic interactions and
   physical conditions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{114}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Photochemical degradation of Congo River dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   was investigated to examine the fate of terrigenous DOM derived from
   tropical ecosystems. Tropical riverine DOM receives greater exposure to
   solar radiation, particularly in large river plumes discharging directly
   into the open ocean. Initial Congo River DOM exhibited dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) concentration and compositional characteristics typical of
   organic rich blackwater systems. During a 57 day irradiation experiment,
   Congo River DOM was shown to be highly photoreactive with a decrease in
   DOC, chromophoric DOM (CDOM), lignin phenol concentrations (Sigma(8))
   and carbon-normalized yields (Lambda(8)), equivalent to losses of
   similar to 45, 85-95, >95 and >95\% of initial values, respectively, and
   a +3.1 parts per thousand enrichment of the delta C-13-DOC signature.
   The loss of Lambda(8) and enrichment of delta C-13-DOC during
   irradiation was strongly correlated (r = 0.99, p < 0.01) indicating
   tight coupling between these biomarkers. Furthermore, the loss of CDOM
   absorbance was correlated to the loss of Lambda(8) (e.g., a(355) versus
   Lambda(8); r = 0.98, p < 0.01) and delta C-13-DOC (e.g., a(355) versus
   delta C-13; r = 0.97, p < 0.01), highlighting the potential of CDOM
   absorbance measurements for delineating the photochemical degradation of
   lignin and thus terrigenous DOM. It is apparent that these commonly used
   measurements for examination of terrigenous DOM in the oceans have a
   higher rate of photochemical decay than the bulk DOC pool. Further
   process-based studies are required to determine the selective removal
   rates of these biomarkers for advancement of our understanding of the
   fate of this material in the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) form from polysaccharides
   released by many phytoplankton species, but this process by which
   dissolved organic matter becomes particulate is poorly understood. Here,
   the abiotic formation of TEP from precursors <0.2 mu m and the minimum
   molecular weight (MW) of TEP-precursors were studied. In most samples
   TEP formed from material <0.2 mu m (polycarbonate membrane filters,
   Poretics) when exposed to laminar shear in Couette flocculators. This
   result was unexpected as no TEP formed from material <0.45 mu m (polycap
   capsules, Whatman) due to surface coagulation onto bubbles (Zhou et al.
   1998; Limnol Oceanogr 43:1860-1871). Some TEP-precursors were able to
   pass through dialysis bags with a nominal pore size of 8 kDa (natural
   cellulose, Spektrum), although their MW is presumably 2 orders of
   magnitude larger, suggesting that TEP-precursors can be fibrillar. It is
   suggested that freshly released precursors are fibrillar and that these
   fibrillar precursors form larger colloids and eventually TEP within
   hours to days after their release.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the factors controlling viral abundance, 22
   lakes in Quebec were surveyed. We measured viral and bacterial
   abundance, bacterial production, chlorophyll a, total phosphorus and DOC

   these data were compared to models based on literature data, which to
   date have been collected largely from marine sites. Positive empirical
   relationships were found between viral abundance and (1) chlorophyll a
   concentrations, (2) bacterial abundances, (3) bacterial production, and
   (4) total phosphorus concentration. There was little to no trend in the
   virus-to-bacteria ratio with increasing trophy. Analysis of covariance
   revealed significant differences between relations in marine and
   freshwater systems. The virus-to-bacteria ratio was significantly higher
   in freshwater (mode = 22.5) than marine environments (mode = 2.5), and
   there were significantly more bacteria per unit chlorophyll in our
   freshwater samples. We suggest that this difference is related to the
   increased dependence of freshwater bacteria on allochthonous material
   relative to marine systems, as well as the increased relative importance
   of photosynthetic cyanobacteria in lakes.}},

   fractions, humic DOC and nonhumic DOC, using an XAD-8 resin to
   selectively adsorb the humic substances.  Results of microcosm studies
   revealed that the humic fraction of DOC was used by natural bacterial
   assemblages from the lake and marsh as a C and energy source, as
   indicated both by increases in bacterial biovolume and rates of
   bacterial incorporation of {[}H-3]thymidine.  Humic substances supported
   fourfold less bacterial secondary production per unit of initial C,
   however, than did nonhumic substances from the same environment. 
   Bacterial utilization of humic compounds accounted for a significant
   fraction of the total bacterial production on DOC, measured as increases
   in bacterial biovolume; humic substances supported an average of 22\% of
   total growth on DOC from the lake and 53\% of the total growth on DOC
   from the marsh.  The relative bioavailability of both the humic and

Abstract = {{A general, size-based simulation model is developed to investigate the
   dynamics of carbon and nitrogen flows in plankton communities. In the
   model, community structure and transfer processes are all
   size-dependent, and all model parameters are determined by body size,
   using empirically determined relationships calculated from published
   data. Major flows include carbon fixation, release of photosynthetically
   produced dissolved organic carbon (PDOC), nitrogen uptake, respiration,
   excretion, predation, senescence and sinking. Because the model is based
   on general ecological principles and not on a specific ecosystem or data
   set, it can be used to simulate interactions within plankton communities
   of any ecosystem. The structure of the model can easily be altered to
   incorporate fewer or more size classes, or different size ranges of
   organisms. The program adjusts interactions between different components
   to allow for changes in the number of size classes, and new parameters
   are estimated, based on mean organism size. A standard simulation is
   described, which serves as the basis for comparing output from a
   sensitivity analysis. The model is robust with respect to most
   parameters. Important factors which affect model output include
   estimates of various rate parameters (which may be altered by
   environmental effects), shapes of initial biomass distributions (seeding
   effects), and wet mass to carbon conversion functions. The model is a
   useful tool to assist in analysing and interpreting carbon and nitrogen
   flows in planktonic ecosystems.}},

Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{The Southern Ocean exerts a strong impact on marine biogeochemical
   cycles and global air-sea CO(2) fluxes. Over the coming century, large
   increases in surface ocean CO(2) levels, combined with increased upper
   water column temperatures and stratification, are expected to diminish
   Southern Ocean CO(2) uptake. These effects could be significantly
   modulated by concomitant CO(2)-dependent changes in the region's
   biological carbon pump. Here we show that CO(2) concentrations affect
   the physiology, growth and species composition of phytoplankton
   assemblages in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Field results from in situ
   sampling and ship-board incubation experiments demonstrate that
   inorganic carbon uptake, steady-state productivity and diatom species
   composition are sensitive to CO(2) concentrations ranging from 100 to
   800 ppm. Elevated CO(2) led to a measurable increase in phytoplankton
   productivity, promoting the growth of larger chain-forming diatoms. Our
   results suggest that CO(2) concentrations can influence biological
   carbon cycling in the Southern Ocean, thereby creating potential climate
   feedbacks.}},

Abstract = {{The discharge of the Orinoco River significantly affects the optical
   properties of the water in the Caribbean Sea by increasing primary
   productivity and introducing large amounts of colored dissolved organic
   matter (CDOM) to the region. The optical characteristics of the CDOM in
   the Orinoco River plume were investigated during two cruises to the
   eastern Caribbean using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. We
   found that high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and
   abundance of CDOM in the eastern Caribbean were related to the Orinoco
   River plume. We did not observe changes in optical properties of CDOM in
   waters with salinities lower than 30. Self-shading from sunlight and the
   preponderance of riverine material at these low salinities can explain
   the observed behavior. Changes in the optical properties of the CDOM
   were observed in stations with salinities higher than 30 and were
   related to mixing between riverine and marine end-members, and to
   photodegradation. Light penetration and, consequently, the position of
   the chlorophyll maxima in areas close to the Gulf of Paria were
   controlled by the concentration of CDOM. Of the two main fluorophores
   found in this study, only the humic fluorophore appeared to be related
   to the absorption of light by CDOM in the visible spectrum. A secondary
   fluorophore, with excitation and emission in the UV, appeared to be
   resistant to photodegradation and did not show any relationship with
   absorbance in the visible range. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{IRON availability limits phytoplankton growth in large areas of the
   world's oceans(1-3) and may influence the strength of the biological
   carbon pump(4-5). Very little is known of the iron requirements of
   oceanic heterotrophic bacteria, which constitute up to 50\% of the total
   particulate organic carbon in open ocean waters(6,7) and are important
   in carbon cycling as remineralizers of dissolved organic matter and
   hence producers of CO2 (ref. 8). Here we report that oceanic bacteria
   contain more iron per biomass than phytoplankton. Tn the subarctic
   Pacific, they constitute a large fraction of biogenic iron and account
   for 20-45\% of biological iron uptake, Bacterial iron quotas in the
   field are similar to those of iran-deficient laboratory cultures, which
   exhibit reduced electron transport, slow growth, and low carbon growth
   efficiency. Heterotrophic bacteria therefore play a major role in the
   biogeochemical cycling of iron. In situ iron limitation of heterotrophic
   metabolism may have profound effects on carbon Bur in the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{The release of ammonium from the photochemical degradation of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) has been proposed by earlier studies as a
   potentially important remineralisation pathway for refractory organic
   nitrogen. In this study the photochemical production of ammonium from
   Baltic Sea DOM was assessed in the laboratory. Filtered samples from the
   Bothnian Bay, the Gulf of Finland and the Arkona Sea were exposed to UVA
   light at environmentally relevant levels, and the developments in
   ammonium concentrations, light absorption, fluorescence and molecular
   size distribution were followed. The exposures resulted in a decrease in
   DOM absorption and loss of the larger sized fraction of DOM. Analysis of
   the fluorescence properties of DOM using parallel factor analysis
   (PARAFAC) identified 6 independent components. Five components decreased
   in intensity as a result of the UVA exposures. One component was
   produced as a result of the exposures and represents labile
   photoproducts derived from terrestrial DOM. The characteristics of DOM
   in samples from the Bothnian Bay and Gulf of Finland were similar and
   dominated by terrestrially derived material. The DOM from the Arkona Sea
   was more autochthonous in character. Photoammonification differed
   depending on the composition of DOM. Calculated photoammonification
   rates in surface waters varied between 121 and 382 mu mol NH4+ L-1
   d(-1). Estimated areal daily production rates ranged between 37 and 237
   mu mol NH4+ m(-2) d(-1), which are comparable to atmospheric deposition
   rates and suggest that photochemical remineralisation of organic
   nitrogen may be a significant source of bioavailable nitrogen to surface
   waters during summer months with high irradiance and low inorganic
   nitrogen concentrations. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of viral lysis and heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF)
   grazing on bacterial mortality were estimated in a eutrophic lake (Lake
   Plusssee in northern Germany) which was separated by a steep temperature
   and oxygen gradient into a warm and oxic epilimnion and a cold and
   anoxic hypolimnion. Two transmission electron microscopy-based methods
   (whole-cell examination and thin sections) were used to determine the
   frequency of, visibly infected cells, and a model was used to estimate
   bacterial mortality due to viral lysis. Examination of thin sections
   also shelved that between 20.2:! and 29.2\% (average, 26.1\%) of the
   bacterial cells were empty (ghosts) and thus could not contribute to
   viral production. The most important finding was that the mechanism fur
   regulating bacterial production shifted with depth from grazing control
   in the epilimnion to control due to viral lysis in the hypolimnion. We
   estimated that in the epilimnion viral lysis accounted on average for
   8.4 to 41.8\% of the summed mortality (calculated by determining the sum
   of the mortalities due to lysis and grazing), compared to 51.3 to 91.0\%
   of the summed mortality in the metalimnion and 88.5 to 94.2\% of the
   summed mortality in the hypolimnion. Estimates of summed mortality
   values indicated that bacterial production was controlled completely or
   almost completely in the epilimnion (summed mortality, 66.6 to 128.5\%)
   and the hypolimnion (summed mortality, 43.4 to 103.3\%), whereas in the
   metalimnion viral lysis and HNF grazing were not sufficient to control
   bacterial production (summed mortality, 22.4 to 56.7\%). The estimated
   contribution of organic matter released by viral lysis of cells into the
   pool of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was low; however, since cell
   lysis products are very likely labile compared to the bulk DOM, they
   might stimulate bacterial production. The high mortality of
   bacterioplankton due to viral lysis in anoxic water indicates that a
   significant portion of bacterial production in the metalimnion and
   hypolimnion is cycled in the bacterium-virus-DOM loop. This finding has
   major implications for the fate and cycling of organic nutrients in
   lakes.}},

Abstract = {{Iron coordination and redox reactions in synthetic and coastal seawater
   were investigated at nanomolar concentrations using Fe-59 radiometry and
   ion-pair solvent extraction of iron chelated by sulfoxine
   (8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonate) and BPDS (bathophenanthroline
   disulfonate). Using sulfoxine. we determined the rate at which the
   monomeric Fe(III) hydroxide species present in seawater of pH 8 are
   complexed by the microbial siderophore deferriferrioxamine B and the
   synthetic chelator EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). Forward rate
   constants of 2 X 10(6)M-1 s-1 and 20 M-1 s-1, respectively, were
   obtained. The kinetics of these reactions have not been measured
   previously at pH values near that of seawater. Conditional equilibrium
   constants measured for the Fe(III)-EDTA system are consistent with
   published stability constants for EDTA complexes and for Fe(III)
   hydrolytic equilibria minus the neutral Fe(OH)3-degrees species,
   suggesting it is not quantitatively significant near pH 8. Commercial
   humic acid was found to have sufficient affinity for iron to compete
   with Fe(III) hydrolysis in seawater, and limited evidence was obtained
   for an interaction with dissolved organic matter in coastal seawater.
   In our investigations of redox reactions using BPDS to trap Fe(II)
   produced in the medium, we observed enhanced photoreduction of Fe(III)
   by humic acid as well as reduction induced by solutes released from
   phytoplankton in seawater of pH 8. Although the method is sensitive
   enough to work al near-oceanic levels of iron, the difficulty in
   distinguishing Fe(II) generated by Fe(III)-BPDS interactions from Fe(II)
   produced by other means limits its utility. This analytical ambiguity
   may be generalizable to other methods which measure ferrous iron in
   seawater using Fe(II)-specific ligands.}},

Abstract = {{Fluids from the Ultramafic-hosted Lost City hydrothermal field were
   analyzed for total dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic acids.
   Formate (36-158 mu mol/kg) and acetate (1-35 mu mol/kg) concentrations
   are higher than ill other fluids from unsedimented hydrothermal vents,
   and are a higher ratio of the total dissolved organic carbon than has
   been found in most marine geothermal systems. Isotopic evidence is
   consistent with all abiotic formation mechanism for formate, perhaps
   during serpentinization processes in the sub-surface. Further Support
   comes from previous Studies where the abiological formation of low
   molecular weight organic acids has been shown to be thermodynamically
   favorable during hydrothermal alteration of olivine, and laboratory
   studies in which the reduction of carbon dioxide to formate has been
   confirmed. As the second most prevalent carbon species after methane,
   formate may be an important substrate to microbial communities in an
   environment where dissolved inorganic carbon is limited. Acetate is
   found in locations where Sulfate reduction is believed to be important
   and is likely to be a microbial by-product, formed either directly by
   autotrophic metabolic activity or indirectly during the fermentative
   degradation of larger organic molecules. Given the common Occurrence of
   exposed Ultramafic rocks and active serpentinization within the worlds
   ocean basins, the abiotic formation of formate may be all important
   process supporting life in these high pH environments and may have
   critical implications to understanding the organic precursors from which
   life evolved. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   406, 989-992] stromatolite mat exhibited a distinct layering of
   alternating ``green{''} cyanobacteria-rich layers (Layers 1 and 3) and
   ``white{''} layers (Layers 2 and 4), and the natural abundance of EPS
   varied significantly depending on the mat layer. The highest EPS
   abundance occurred in Layer 2. The production of new EPS, as estimated
   by the incorporation of 14 C-bicarbonate into EPS, occurred in all
   layers examined, with the highest production in Layer I and during
   periods of photosynthesis (i.e., daylight hours). A large pool (i.e., up
   to 49\%) of the total C-14- bicarbonate uptake was released as low
   molecular-weight (MW) dissolved organic carbon (DOC). This DOC was
   rapidly mineralized to CO2 by heterotrophic bacteria. EPS degradation,
   as determined by the conversion of C-14-EPS to (CO2)-C-14, was slowest
   in Layer 2. Results of slurry experiments, examining O-2 uptake
   following additions of organic substrates, including EPS, supported this
   degradation trend and further demonstrated selective utilization by
   heterotrophs of specific monomers, such as acetate, ethanol, and uronic
   acids. Results indicated that natural EPS may be rapidly transformed
   post-secretion by heterotrophic degradation, specifically by
   sulfate-reducing bacteria, to a more-refractory remnant polymer that is
   relatively slow to accumulate. A mass balance analysis suggested that a
   layer-specific pattern in EPS and low-MW DOC turnover may contribute to
   major carbonate precipitation events within stromatolites. Our findings
   represent the first estimate of EPS turnover in stromatolites and

Abstract = {{High-altitude lakes are exposed to high fluence rates of solar
   ultraviolet radiation (UVR; 290-400 nm) and contain low concentrations
   of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). While in most lowland lakes, DOC can
   be used to predict UV transparency with sufficient accuracy, current
   models fail to estimate UVR in clear alpine lakes. In these lakes,
   phytoplankton may contribute significantly to the UV attenuation either
   as particles or as a source of chromophoric dissolved organic matter
   (CDOM) with distinctive properties. We investigated a series of 26 lakes
   in the Alps and Pyrenees, situated at elevations ranging from 422 to
   2,799 m above sea level and having DOC concentrations ranging from 0.2
   to 3.5 mg L-1. CDOM, as measured by the absorptivity of filtered lake
   water, explained most of the variability in the attenuation of
   underwater UVR among lakes (r(2) = 0.94, P < 0.001). However,
   within-lake variation in the UV attenuation revealed a significant
   contribution from phytoplankton in deeper waters (UV attenuation
   increasing with chlorophyll a concentration; r(2) = 0.97, P = 0.002),
   only apparent when DOC concentrations were low (similar to 0.3 mg L-1).
   The DOG-specific absorptivity (a(g){*}) was also important for
   characterizing the optical conditions in this series of lakes.
   Epilimnetic values of a(g){*} were significantly lower in lakes located
   at high elevations (with low allochthonous CDOM inputs from the
   catchment), compared to lakes surrounded by trees and meadows. Moreover,
   a(g){*} was generally lower in surface waters than in deeper water
   layers, suggesting the influence of photobleaching on UV transparency.
   The slope S of the exponential regression between CDOM absorptivity and
   wavelength did not show clear patterns, such as found in marine systems,
   and often presented lower values in the epilimnetic waters (in
   association with lower a(g){*}). Collectively, our results suggest that
   in transparent alpine lakes, the dynamics of the CDOM pool and
   phytoplankton production will have a strong effect on temporal changes
   in UV underwater attenuation.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular-level characterization of natural organic matter (NOM) has
   been elusive due to the inherent complexity of natural organic mixtures
   and to the fact that individual components are often polar and
   macromolecular. Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a ``soft{''} ionization
   technique that ionizes polar compounds from aqueous solution prior to
   injection into a mass spectrometer. The highest resolution and mass
   accuracy of compounds within NOM have been achieved when ESI is combined
   with an ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometer such as the Fourier
   transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). With
   this technique, individual molecules within a variety of natural organic
   mixtures can be detected and their elemental composition can be
   determined. At low mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio, the resolution is high
   enough to assign exact molecular formulas allowing specific components
   of these mixtures to be identified. In addition to molecular
   identification, we can now use ESI FT-ICR MS to examine molecular-level
   changes in different organic mixtures as a function of relevant
   geo-processes, such as microbial alterations and photochemistry. Here we
   present the results from the application of ESI FT-ICR MS to two
   geochemical questions: (1) the effect of photoirradiation on the
   molecular composition of fulvic acids and (2) the role of protozoan
   grazers in the modification of DOM in aquatic systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Title = {{Organic carbon partitioning during spring phytoplankton blooms in the

Journal = {{LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{375-386}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this study we evaluate the partitioning of organic carbon between the
   particulate and dissolved pools during spring phytoplankton blooms in
   the Ross Sea, Antarctica, and the Sargasso Sea. As part of a
   multidisciplinary project in the Ross Sea polynya we investigated the
   dynamics of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool and the role it
   played in the carbon cycle during the 1994 spring phytoplankton bloom.
   Phytoplankton biomass during the bloom was dominated by an Antarctic
   Phaeocystis sp. We determined primary productivity (PP; via
   H(14)CO(3)(-) incubations), particulate organic carbon (POC), bacterial
   productivity (BP; via {[}(3)H]thymidine incorporation), and DOC during
   two occupations of 76 degrees 30'S from 175 degrees W to 168 degrees E.
   Results from this bloom are compared to blooms observed in the Sargasso
   Sea in the vicinity of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study station
   (BATS). We present data that demonstrate clear differences in the
   production, biolability, and accumulation of DOC between the two ocean
   regions. Despite four- to fivefold greater PP in the Ross Sea, almost an
   order of magnitude less DOC (mmol m(-2)) accumulated during the Ross Sea
   bloom compared to the Sargasso Sea blooms. In the Ross Sea 89\% (similar
   to 1 mol C m-2) of the total organic carbon (TOC) that accumulated
   during the bloom was partitioned as POC, with the remaining 11\%
   (similar to 0.1 mol C m(-2)) partitioned as DOC. In contrast, a mean of
   86\% (0.75-1.0 mol m(-2)) of TOC accumulated as DOC during the 1992,
   1993, and 1995 blooms in the Sargasso Sea, with as little as 14\%
   (0.08-0.29 mol C m(-2)) accumulating as POC. Although a relatively small
   portion of the fixed carbon was produced as DOC in the Ross Sea, the
   bacterial carbon demand indicated that a qualitatively more labile
   carbon was produced in the Ross Sea compared to the Sargasso Sea. There
   are fundamental differences in organic carbon partitioning between the
   two systems that may be controlled by plankton community structure and
   food-web dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Carbohydrates are major components of marine organic matter, but few
   molecular-level carbohydrate analyses in seawater have been undertaken
   owing to the low concentrations of individual compounds. This paper
   presents novel data on aldose compositions and concentrations in various
   size fractions of particulate and dissolved organic matter from the
   equatorial Pacific. Samples of high-molecular-weight (HMW >1 kDa)
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) and suspended particulate organic matter
   (POM, >0.1 mu m) were collected by tangential-flow ultrafiltration.
   Aldose content of low-molecular-weight (LMW) DOM was calculated as the
   difference between aldose content in unfiltered samples and HMW DOM +
   POM. Size-fractionated and unfiltered samples were hydrolyzed with
   sulfuric acid, and aldoses were separated and detected by
   high-performance anion-exchange chromatography and pulsed amperometric
   detection. A detailed description of the method is provided. The
   concentrations of fucose, rhamnose, arabinose, glucose, galactose,
   xylose, and mannose were determined. In general, the predominant sugars
   were glucose and galactose. The HMW DOM fraction was slightly enriched
   in deoxysugars and galactose. The average depth-integrated size
   distribution of aldoses indicated that 68\% of aldoses were LMW DOM,
   28\% were HMW DOM, and 4\% were POM. Concentrations and yields
   (normalized to organic carbon) of aldoses in POM and HMW DOM decreased
   with depth, indicating selective degradation of aldoses. The molecular
   compositions of the degraded components of POM and HMW DOM were similar
   to surface compositions but the mole \% glucose increased with depth,
   implying that glucose was preferentially preserved in a refractory
   structure. The fraction with the highest aldose yield was POM, followed
   by HMW DOM and LMW DOM. In surface waters from both stations, the
   largest fractions of dissolved aldoses were found in HMW DOM, whereas in
   subsurface waters most dissolved aldoses were found in LMW DOM. Yields
   and concentrations of aldoses indicated a size-related diagenetic
   sequence where POM represents the most reactive material and LMW DOM the
   most refractory material. Aldoses represented 1.7-3.6\% of DOC and
   10-20\% of total carbohydrates, indicating that a large fraction of the
   carbohydrate pool is still uncharacterized at the molecular level,
   Aldoses could be identified in all, presumably refractory, deep-water
   samples, and most of the aldoses in deep water were LMW, indicating that
   a factor other than molecular composition was important in determining
   biological availability of the aldoses.}},

Abstract = {{High-latitude northern rivers export globally significant quantities of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to the Arctic Ocean. Climate change, and
   its associated impacts on hydrology and potential mobilization of
   ancient organic matter from permafrost, is likely to modify the flux,
   composition, and thus biogeochemical cycling and fate of exported DOC in
   the Arctic. This study examined DOC concentration and the composition of
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) across the hydrograph in Siberia's Kolyma
   River, with a particular focus on the spring freshet period when the
   majority of the annual DOC load is exported. The composition of DOM
   within the Kolyma basin was characterized using absorbance-derived
   measurements (absorbance coefficient a(330), specific UV absorbance
   (SUVA(254)), and spectral slope ratio S-R) and fluorescence spectroscopy
   (fluorescence index and excitation-emission matrices (EEMs)), including
   parallel factor analyses of EEMs. Increased surface runoff during the
   spring freshet led to DOM optical properties indicative of terrestrial
   soil inputs with high humic-like fluorescence, SUVA(254), and low S-R
   and fluorescence index (FI). Under-ice waters, in contrast, displayed
   opposing trends in optical properties representing less aromatic, lower
   molecular weight DOM. We demonstrate that substantial losses of DOC can
   occur via biological (similar to 30\% over 28 days) and photochemical
   pathways (>29\% over 14 days), particularly in samples collected during
   the spring freshet. The emerging view is therefore that of a more
   dynamic and labile carbon pool than previously thought, where DOM
   composition plays a fundamental role in controlling the fate and removal
   of DOC at a pan-Arctic scale.}},

   (pore water), and <0.01-0.58 ng/g dry weight (sediment). The levels of
   total hexachlorocyclohexane (HCHs) in sediments varied from <0.01 to
   0.14 ng/g dry weight, and those of total DDTs were in the range of
   <0.01-0.06 ng/g dry weight. The micropollutants were present in higher
   levels in pore water than in surface water, due possibly to higher
   concentrations of dissolved organic carbon or colloids with which the
   hydrophobic pollutants are strongly associated. Such a concentration
   gradient implies a potential Aux of pollutants From sediment pore water
   to overlying water. The levels of pollutants in sediments are one to
   several orders of magnitude lower than those found in 1993, suggesting
   their decreased inputs in recent years in the form of fresh and less
   contaminated material and possible degradation over a period of time.
   Further work is needed to quantify the levels of these contaminants in
   suspended particulate matter, which are currently below the limits of
   detection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a master variable in aquatic systems.
   Modern fluorescence techniques couple measurements of excitation
   emission matrix (EEM) spectra and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to
   determine fluorescent DOM (FDOM) components and DOM quality. However,
   the molecular signatures associated with PARAFAC components are poorly
   defined. In the current study we characterized river water samples from
   boreal Quebec, Canada, using EEM/PARAFAC analysis and ultrahigh
   resolution mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Spearmans correlation of
   FTICR-MS peak and PARAFAC component relative intensities determined the
   molecular families associated with 6 PARAFAC components. Molecular
   families associated with PARAFAC components numbered from 39 to 572
   FTICR-MS derived elemental formulas. Detailed molecular properties for
   each of the classical humic- and protein-like FDOM components are
   presented. FTICR-MS formulas assigned to PARAFAC components represented
   39\% of the total number of formulas identified and 59\% of total
   FTICR-MS peak intensities, and included significant numbers compounds
   that are highly unlikely to fluoresce. Thus, fluorescence measurements
   offer insight into the biogeochemical cycling of a large proportion of
   the DOM pool, including a broad suite of unseen molecules that
   apparently follow the same gradients as FDOM in the environment.}},

Title = {{Source and transport of terrigenous organic matter in the upper Yukon
   River: Evidence from isotope (delta C-13, Delta C-14, and delta N-15)
   composition of dissolved, colloidal, and particulate phases}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Natural organic matter was collected from the upper Yukon River and size
   fractionated into the <1 kDa low-molecular-weight dissolved (LMW-DOC),
   colloidal (COC, 1 kDa to 0.45 mu m) and particulate organic carbon (POC,
   > 0.45 mu m) phases for characterization of elemental (C and N) and
   isotopic (C-13, C-14 and N-15) composition to examine their sources and
   transport. Concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) decreased from
   3010 mu M in mid-May to 608 mu M in September, accompanying an increase
   in river water delta O-18 from the snowmelt to summer and early fall.
   COC was the predominant OC species, comprising, on average, 63 +/- 8\%
   of the TOC, with 23 +/- 5\% partitioned in the LMW-DOC and 14 +/- 5\% in
   the POC fraction. Annual riverine export flux to the ocean was 2.02 +/-
   10(12) g-C for TOC, 7.66 x 10(10) g-N for total organic nitrogen (TON),
   and 3.53 x 10(12) g-C for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC),
   respectively. The C/N molar ratios were distinctly different between
   colloidal organic matter (COM, 46 +/- 3) and particulate organic matter
   (POM, 15 +/- 1.4). Similar delta C-13 values were found for LMW-DOM
   (-27.9 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand), COM (-27.4 +/- 0.2 parts per
   thousand), and POM (-26.2 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand), although there
   was a general increase with increasing size, suggesting a common
   terrigenous organic source. In contrast, distinct D 14 C values were
   found for LMW-DOC (-155 to +91 parts per thousand), COC (40 to 140 parts
   per thousand), and POC (-467 to -253 parts per thousand) with a
   decreasing trend from snowmelt to ice-open season, suggesting that
   turnover pathways and transport mechanisms vary with organic matter size
   fractions. The high abundance of COC and its contemporary C-14 ages
   points to a predominant source from modern terrestrial primary
   production, likely from the leaching/decomposition of fresh plant litter
   in the upper soil horizon. The predominately old POC (average 3698 +/-
   902 years B. P.), in contrast, was largely derived from riverbank
   erosion and melting of permafrost. These results imply that ice-opening
   Yukon River flows are dominated by snowmelt (low delta O-18) with high
   DOC (high Delta C-14) but low DIC and Si(OH)(4) concentrations, whereas
   late summer flows contain more products of permafrost or ice melt and
   rain (high delta O-18), with low DOC (low Delta C-14) but high DIC and
   Si(OH)(4) concentrations. A warming climate with a deeper permafrost
   active layer in the Yukon River watershed would enhance the mobilization
   and export of old terrestrial OC, but largely in the particulate form
   into the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between bacterial 16S rRNA gene composition and carbon
   metabolism was analyzed during an intense dinoflagellate bloom off the
   Southern California coast during the spring of 1997. Bacterial numbers
   and rate processes, chlorophyll a, and the dissolved and particulate
   organic matter pools were measured during the bloom to provide a
   framework within which to assess bacterial community composition. Free
   bacteria were numerically dominant, generally comprising >90\% of the
   total, and were responsible for >70\% of bacterial production. Attached
   bacteria had higher cell-specific growth rates than free bacteria (range
   = 0.5 to 15.1 and 0.7 to 2.5 d(-1), respectively) and had hydrolytic
   ectoenzyme activities at times more than an order of magnitude higher on
   a per cell basis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of
   bacterial community composition indicated that: (1) the free and
   attached communities were distinct, and (2) marked shifts in bacterial
   community structure occurred concomitant with the peaks in attached
   enzyme activities, specific growth rates and DOC concentration. Of the
   24 16S rDNA clones analyzed, 7 were related to the Cytophaga-like
   bacteria (CLB), 6 to the alpha -subclass and 5 to the gamma -subclass of
   the Proteobacteria; 3 were related to oxygenic phototrophs, 2 were
   heteroduplexes and 1 was a possible chimera. While the alpha- and gamma
   -Proteobacteria predominated in the <1.0 <mu>m fraction, CLB were
   identified in both the free and attached fractions as well as among
   bacteria cultured from the same water, without overlap among these
   groups. The observation that distinct Cytophaga group sequences were
   present in the free versus attached fractions is counter to the current
   understanding that these organisms occupy a principally
   `particle-specialist' niche. Our results suggest that some CLB are also
   important in the decomposition of polymeric organic matter in the
   dissolved phase with implications for the accumulation of dissolved
   organic matter and pathways of carbon flow during phytoplankton blooms.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of photochemical transformations on the bioavailability of
   marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated in surface and
   deep water from the Gulf of Mexico. Seawater samples were collected from
   eight depths (15-1,000 m), passed through 0.2-mu m pore-size filters,
   and exposed to sunlight in quartz bottles in a flowing seawater deck
   incubator for 5-9 h. Following sunlight exposure, samples were
   inoculated (1:10) with unfiltered seawater from 15-m depth, and
   bacterial growth rates were estimated from rates of H-3-leucine
   incorporation in dark incubations. Exposure of surface-water DOM to
   sunlight resulted in a 75\% reduction in bacterial production, whereas
   exposure of deep-water DOM resulted in a 40\% enhancement in bacterial
   production. Photomineralization of bioreactive DOM likely contributed to
   the reduction of bacterial growth in surface water, but the
   photoproduction of biorefractory DOM also appeared to contribute to
   reduced bacterial growth. Enhanced bacterial growth in irradiated deep
   water was consistent with previous studies demonstrating the
   photoproduction of bioavailable substrates from deep-water DOM.
   Phototransformations of DOM appeared to be multifaceted and to play a

Pages = {{995-1005}},
Abstract = {{The traditional view of the planktonic food web describes consumption of
   inorganic nutrients by photoautotrophic phytoplankton, which in turn
   supports zooplankton and ultimately higher trophic levels. Pathways
   centred on bacteria provide mechanisms for nutrient recycling. This
   structure lies at the foundation of most models used to explore
   biogeochemical cycling, functioning of the biological pump, and the
   impact of climate change on these processes. We suggest an alternative
   new paradigm, which sees the bulk of the base of this food web supported
   by protist plankton communities that are mixotrophic - combining
   phototrophy and phagotrophy within a single cell. The photoautotrophic
   eukaryotic plankton and their heterotrophic microzooplankton grazers
   dominate only during the developmental phases of ecosystems (e. g.
   spring bloom in temperate systems). With their flexible nutrition,
   mixotrophic protists dominate in more-mature systems (e. g. temperate
   summer, established eutrophic systems and oligotrophic systems); the
   more-stable water columns suggested under climate change may also be
   expected to favour these mixotrophs. We explore how such a predominantly
   mixotrophic structure affects microbial trophic dynamics and the
   biological pump. The mixotroph-dominated structure differs fundamentally
   in its flow of energy and nutrients, with a shortened and potentially
   more efficient chain from nutrient regeneration to primary production.
   Furthermore, mixotrophy enables a direct conduit for the support of
   primary production from bacterial production. We show how the exclusion
   of an explicit mixotrophic component in studies of the pelagic microbial
   communities leads to a failure to capture the true dynamics of the
   carbon flow. In order to prevent a misinterpretation of the full
   implications of climate change upon biogeochemical cycling and the
   functioning of the biological pump, we recommend inclusion of
   multi-nutrient mixotroph models within ecosystem studies.}},

Abstract = {{The vast majority of organic matter in the world ocean is found in the
   dissolved pool. However, no evidence has been demonstrated for direct
   uptake of bulk dissolved organic matter (DOM) by organisms other than
   bacteria and some invertebrate larvae. The total organic carbon (TOC) is
   10-30\% higher in coral reefs than in adjacent open waters. The
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) accounts for >90\% of the TOC. Using a
   new in situ technique for clean sampling of the seawater inhaled and
   exhaled by benthic suspension feeders, we measured directly the removal
   of DOC in the symbiont-bearing reef sponge Theonella swinhoei. The
   sponge removed up to 26\% (mean +/- SD: 12\% +/- 8\%) of the TOC
   (dissolved and particulate) from the water it filtered during a single
   passage through its filtration system. Most of the carbon gained by the
   sponge was from the dissolved pool (10 +/- 7 mumol C L-1), an order of
   magnitude greater than the carbon gained from the total living cells
   (phytoplankton and bacteria) the sponge removed (2 +/- 1 mumol C L-1).
   In T. swinhoei, over two-thirds of the sponge biomass consists of
   symbiotic bacteria, which likely play an important role in DOC uptake.
   Our findings indicate that the role of DOC in metazoan nutrition and the
   role of metazoans in DOC cycling may have been grossly underestimated.}},

Abstract = {{We construct a global atmospheric budget for acetaldehyde using a 3-D
   model of atmospheric chemistry (GEOS-Chem), and use an ensemble of
   observations to evaluate present understanding of its sources and sinks.
   Hydrocarbon oxidation provides the largest acetaldehyde source in the
   model (128 Tg a(-1), a factor of 4 greater than the previous estimate),
   with alkanes, alkenes, and ethanol the main precursors. There is also a
   minor source from isoprene oxidation. We use an updated chemical
   mechanism for GEOSChem, and photochemical acetaldehyde yields are
   consistent with the Master Chemical Mechanism. We present a new approach
   to quantifying the acetaldehyde air-sea flux based on the global
   distribution of light absorption due to colored dissolved organic matter
   (CDOM) derived from satellite ocean color observations. The resulting
   net ocean emission is 57 Tg a(-1), the second largest global source of
   acetaldehyde. A key uncertainty is the acetaldehyde turnover time in the
   ocean mixed layer, with quantitative model evaluation over the ocean
   complicated by known measurement artifacts in clean air. Simulated
   concentrations in surface air over the ocean generally agree well with
   aircraft measurements, though the model tends to overestimate the
   vertical gradient. PAN: NOx ratios are well-simulated in the marine
   boundary layer, providing some support for the modeled ocean source. We
   introduce the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature
   (MEGANv2.1) for acetaldehyde and ethanol and use it to quantify their
   net flux from living terrestrial plants. Including emissions from
   decaying plants the total direct acetaldehyde source from the land
   biosphere is 23 Tg a(-1). Other terrestrial acetaldehyde sources include
   biomass burning (3 Tg a(-1)) and anthropogenic emissions (2 Tg a(-1)).
   Simulated concentrations in the continental boundary layer are generally
   unbiased and capture the spatial gradients seen in observations over
   North America, Europe, and tropical South America. However, the model
   underestimates acetaldehyde levels in urban outflow, suggesting a
   missing source in polluted air. Ubiquitous high measured concentrations
   in the free troposphere are not captured by the model, and based on
   present understanding are not consistent with concurrent measurements of
   PAN and NOx: we find no compelling evidence for a widespread missing
   acetaldehyde source in the free troposphere. We estimate the current US
   source of ethanol and acetaldehyde (primary + secondary) at 1.3 Tg a(-1)
   and 7.8 Tg a(-1), approximately 60\% and 480\% of the corresponding
   increases expected for a national transition from gasoline to ethanol
   fuel.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon mineralization of fresh and aged diatoms (Skeletonema costatum)
   and barley hay (Hordeum vulgare) was followed for 23 to 35 d in sandy
   and silty sediment. By the use of a thin-layer flow-through technique.
   it was possible to expose the sediment selectively for oxygen, nitrate
   or sulfate as electron accepters in the terminal oxidation of organic
   carbon. Decomposition took place in two basic stages. Mineralization of
   the rapidly leachable fraction of the fresh materials occurred rapidly
   and with the same constant rate regardless of the electron acceptor
   available, indicating that the dissolved organic carbon released
   initially was labile and readily available for all heterotrophic
   respirers. In the case of diatoms, decay of the remaining, more
   refractory, particulate fraction of fresh and aged diatoms were
   strikingly similar, although both were degraded 5 to 10 times faster
   under oxic than anoxic conditions. Most of the particulate remains of
   diatoms after leaching apparently belong to one fraction, which
   maintains the same degradability even after prolonged aging. With
   respect to hay, the late divergence in rates of aerobic and anaerobic
   decay (a factor of 4 to 5 for aged hay only after 20 d) indicated that
   the larger hay particles (<500 <mu>m) became exhausted in labile organic
   matter much slower through time than fine-particulate diatoms (similar
   to 20 mum). Anaerobic carbon mineralization rates of diatoms and hay
   particulates with sulfate and nitrate as electron accepters were similar
   or up to two times faster with sulfate. The generally low levels of
   dissolved organic carbon in all incubations after the initial leaching
   phase suggest that the limiting step of decomposition under both aerobic
   and anaerobic decay is the initial hydrolytic attack on the complex
   particulate remains. Based on a volumetric model, we show that the
   exposure of anoxic subsurface sediment containing partly degraded
   organic material to oxygen via irrigated worm burrows or by reworking
   may significantly enhance total sediment carbon oxidation. The
   enhancement in the irrigation case increases linearly with density (up
   to 80\%) and is higher than the density-independent enhancement (100\%)
   in the reworking case when abundance is above a lower limit of similar
   to 400 individuals/m(2). Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of virus infection and lysis of a marine Vibrio sp, on C, N,
   and P turnover and the growth efficiency of noninfected bacterioplankton
   were studied in a series of dilution cultures. The cultures were
   enriched with various sources of organic matter and N and P. The growth
   of the Vibrio host and the growth of the natural bacterioplankton were
   measured by immunofluorescence and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
   staining methods, respectively. Lysis products resulting from infection
   of the Vibrio sp, caused an increase in metabolic activity and cell
   production by the noninfected bacterioplankton. In P-limited cultures,
   the addition of viruses increased the uptake of dissolved organic carbon
   by 72\% and the potential alkaline phosphatase activity by 89\% compared
   with control cultures without viruses. Our data suggest that input of
   available phosphorus through virus-induced Vibrio lysates occurred,
   which caused an increase in the bacterial nutrient uptake, The growth
   efficiency of noninfected bacteria was reduced in the presence of
   viruses compared with the control without viruses (growth efficiencies,
   0.08 +/- 0.03 and 0.24 +/- 0.02, respectively). We suggest that the
   decrease in growth efficiency may be explained by an increase in
   bacterial energy demand associated with extracellular degradation of
   polymeric organic nitrogen and phosphorus in cell lysates.}},

Abstract = {{Correlations between the biomass of phytoplankton and the biomass of
   bacteria and, between the biomass of bacteria and the biomass of
   protozoans suggest that there is coupling between these compartments of
   the ``microbial loop.{''} To investigate this coupling on the species
   level, bacteria and protozoans from untreated lake water inocula were
   allowed to grow on detritus of the green alga Ankistrodesmus falcatus or
   the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria limnetica in continuous-flow systems for
   1 month. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the 16S and
   18S rRNA genes was used. to monitor the development of the bacterial
   community structure and the eukaryotic community structure,
   respectively. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of the DGGE profiles
   revealed the changes in the microbial community structure. This analysis
   showed that significantly different bacterial communities developed on
   the green algal detritus and on the cyanobacterial detritus. Although
   similar results were obtained for the eukaryotic communities,the
   differences were not significant. Hence, our findings indicate that the
   origin of detritus can affect the structure of at least the bacterial
   community. A phylogenetic analysis of 20 18S ribosomal DNA clones that
   were isolated from the continuous cultures revealed that many sequences
   were related to the sequences of bacterivorous protozoans (members:of
   the Ciliophora, Rhizopoda, Amoeba, and Kinetoplastida). One clone
   grouped in a recently established clade whose previously described
   members are all parasites. The affiliations of about 20\% of the clones
   could not be determined.}},

   In addition to this inorganic component, at least tens of thousands of
   organic molecules - collectively known as dissolved organic matter -
   exist in picomole amounts in each litre of sea water. Dissolved organic
   matter is important for aquatic food webs and, integrated over the
   entire volume of the world's oceans, contains roughly as much carbon as
   all living biota on land and in the ocean combined. Yet, the cycling of
   dissolved organic matter in the ocean is not well understood. Recent
   progress in analytical chemistry has allowed the characterization of
   dissolved organic matter at the molecular level in unprecedented detail,
   revealing that a significant proportion has been thermally altered,
   either in deep sediments or through combustion on land with later
   delivery to the sea. Thermal alteration may explain, at least in part,
   the resistance of oceanic dissolved organic matter to microbial
   decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{The composition and biodegradability of streamwater dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) varies with source material and degree of transformation.
   We combined PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence excitation-emission
   spectroscopy and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC)
   incubations to investigate seasonal changes in the lability of DOM along
   a soil-stream continuum in three soil types: bog, forested wetland and
   upland forest. The percent BDOC ranged from 7 to 38\% across all sites,
   and was significantly greater in soil compared to streamwater in the bog
   and forested wetland, but not in the upland forest. The percent BDOC
   also varied significantly over the entire sampling period in soil and
   streamwater for the bog and forested wetland, as BDOC peaked during the
   spring runoff and was lowest during the summer months. Moreover, the
   chemical quality of DOM in wetland soil and streamwater was similar
   during the spring runoff and fall wet season, as demonstrated by the
   similar contribution of protein-like fluorescence (sum of tyrosine and
   tryptophan fluorescence) in soil water and in streams. These findings
   suggest that the tight coupling between terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems is responsible for the delivery of labile DOM from wetland
   soils to streams. The contribution of protein-like fluorescence was
   significantly correlated with BDOC (p < 0.001) over the entire sampling
   period indicating DOM is an important source of C and N for
   heterotrophic microbes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the
   production of protein-rich, labile DOM and subsequent loss in stream
   runoff might be an important loss of labile C and N from coastal
   temperate watersheds.}},

Title = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) release by phytoplankton in the

Abstract = {{The partitioning of organic matter (OM) between dissolved and
   particulate phases is an important factor in determining the fate of
   organic carbon in the ocean. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) release by
   phytoplankton is a ubiquitous process, resulting in 2-50\% of the carbon
   fixed by photosynthesis leaving the cell. This loss can be divided into
   two components: passive leakage by diffusion across the cell membrane
   and the active exudation of DOM into the surrounding environment. At
   present there is no method to distinguish whether DOM is released via
   leakage or exudation. Most explanations for exudation remain
   hypothetical; as while DOM release has been measured extensively, there
   has been relatively little work to determine why DOM is released.
   Further research is needed to determine the composition of the DOM
   released by phytoplankton and to link composition to phytoplankton
   physiological status and environmental conditions. For example, the
   causes and physiology of phytoplankton cell death are poorly understood,
   though cell death increases membrane permeability and presumably DOM
   release. Recent work has shown that phytoplankton interactions with
   bacteria are important in determining both the amount and composition of
   the DOM released. In response to increasing CO2 in the atmosphere,
   climate change is creating increasingly stressful conditions for
   phytoplankton in the surface ocean, including relatively warm water, low
   pH, low nutrient supply and high light. As ocean physics and chemistry
   change, it is hypothesized that a greater proportion of primary
   production will be released directly by phytoplankton into the water as
   DOM. Changes in the partitioning of primary production between the
   dissolved and particulate phases will have bottom-up effects on
   ecosystem structure and function. There is a need for research to
   determine how these changes affect the fate of organic matter in the
   ocean, particularly the efficiency of the biological carbon pump.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the distribution of colored dissolved organic matter
   (CDOM) in the oceans and its role in the global carbon cycle requires a
   better knowledge of the colored materials produced and consumed by
   marine phytoplankton and bacteria. In this work, we examined the net
   uptake and release of CDOM by a natural bacterial community growing on
   DOM derived from four phytoplankton species cultured under axenic
   conditions. Fluorescent humic-like substances exuded by phytoplankton
   (excitation/emission {[}Ex/Em] wavelength, 310 nm/392 nm; Coble's peak
   M) were utilized by bacteria in different proportions depending on the
   phytoplankton species of origin. Furthermore, bacteria produced
   humic-like substances that fluoresce at an Ex/Em wavelength of 340
   nm/440 nm (Coble's peak C). Differences were also observed in the Ex/Em
   wavelengths of the protein-like materials (Coble's peak T) produced by
   phytoplankton and bacteria. The induced fluorescent emission of CDOM
   produced by prokaryotes was an order of magnitude higher than that of
   CDOM produced by eukaryotes. We have also examined the final
   compositions of the bacterial communities growing on the exudates, which
   differed markedly depending on the phytoplankton species of origin.
   Alteromonas and Roseobacter were dominant during all the incubations on
   Chaetoceros sp. and Prorocentrum minimum exudates, respectively.
   Alteromonas was the dominant group growing on Skeletonema costatum
   exudates during the exponential growth phase, but it was replaced by
   Roseobacter afterwards. On Micromonas pusilla exudates, Roseobacter was
   replaced by Bacteroidetes after the exponential growth phase. Our work
   shows that fluorescence excitation-emission matrices of CDOM can be a
   helpful tool for the identification of microbial sources of DOM in the
   marine environment, but further studies are necessary to explore the
   association of particular bacterial groups with specific fluorophores.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive data set of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colored
   dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption measurements is analysed in
   light of tracing the supply and distribution of dissolved organic matter
   in the Arctic Ocean. Two years of river data from six major Arctic
   rivers (Kolyma, Lena, Oh, Mackenzie, Yenisei, and Yukon) and
   measurements from a transect across the Arctic Ocean are presented. The
   results show that although the Lena River currently dominates the supply
   of DOC and CDOM, climate change induced increases in base flow discharge
   will likely increase the contribution of the Yenisei River. Seasonal
   variations in the spectral characteristics of CDOM in the rivers
   reflected the shift in the dominant source of organic matter from modern
   plant litter in the spring freshet to older more degraded material
   during winter low flow periods. Strong correlations were found between
   the river loading of CDOM and DOC across the systems studied indicating
   that in situ CDOM sensors could be used in the future to improve
   estimates of riverine DOC loading. CDOM in the surface waters of the
   Eurasian Basin was largely characterised as riverine material although
   extrapolations to riverine end member concentrations suggested that
   approximately half the riverine CDOM is removed during its transport
   across the shelf. In contrast the Canadian Basin surface waters were
   characterised by a much greater proportion of autochthonous CDOM. These
   differences in DOM quality in the surface waters of the two basins are
   hypothesised to also influence the extent to which material is
   remineralised during its passage through the Arctic Ocean. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Bacteria and Archaea play critical roles in marine energy fluxes and
   nutrient cycles by incorporating and redistributing dissolved organic
   matter and inorganic nutrients in the oceans. How these microorganisms
   do this work at the level of the expressed protein is known only from a
   few studies of targeted lineages. We used comparative membrane
   metaproteomics to identify functional responses of communities to
   different nutrient concentrations on an oceanic scale. Comparative
   analyses of microbial membrane fractions revealed shifts in nutrient
   utilization and energy transduction along an environmental gradient in
   South Atlantic surface waters, from a low-nutrient gyre to a highly
   productive coastal upwelling region. The dominant membrane proteins
   identified (19\%) were TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs), which are
   known to utilize a proton motive force to transport nutrients across the
   outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The ocean-wide importance of
   TonB-dependent nutrient acquisition in marine bacteria was unsuspected.
   Diverse light-harvesting rhodopsins were detected in membrane proteomes
   from every sample. Proteomic evidence of both TBDTs and rhodopsins in
   the same lineages suggest that phototrophic bacterioplankton have the
   potential to use energy from light to fuel transport activities. We also
   identified viral proteins in every sample and archaeal ammonia
   monooxygenase proteins in the upwelling region, suggesting that Archaea
   are important nitrifiers in nutrient-rich surface waters. The ISME

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter in the ocean constitutes one of the largest
   pools of reduced carbon on the Earth's surface(1,2), but its role in the
   global carbon cycle is poorly understood. A large part of this pool is
   thought to be of marine origin(2-4) and to be composed of constituents
   that are resistant to biological degradation(3-6). It is not clear how
   this refractory fraction of the carbon pool is produced in the ocean.
   Here, we analyse observations of fluorescence intensity and apparent
   oxygen utilization in the interior of the Pacific Ocean, and find that
   the two parameters are linearly related in the mesopelagic and abyssal
   layers. We conclude that fluorescent dissolved organic matter is
   produced in situ in the ocean interior as organic matter is oxidized
   biologically, and that it is resistant to biological degradation on
   centennial to millennial timescales. The rate of production of
   bio-refractory fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the ocean
   interior is larger than the riverine input of terrestrial humic
   substances, suggesting that its in situ production is one of the key
   processes in maintaining the oceanic pool of refractory dissolved
   organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical characteristics of extracellular high molecular weight
   (HMW) dissolved organic matter (DOM) from 3 species of marine
   phytoplankton were compared to HMW DOM in seawater. Thalassiosira
   weissflogii, Emiliania huxleyi and Phaeocystis sp., were grown in
   nutrient enriched seawater that had been previously ultrafiltered to
   remove HMW DOM. The extracellular HMW DOM produced in these cultures was
   isolated by ultrafiltration and characterized using nuclear magnetic

   exude DOM rich in polysaccharides, and the exudates of T. weissflogii
   and E. huxleyi closely resemble acyl heteropolysaccharides (APS)
   previously identified as major constituents of naturally occurring
   marine HMW DOM. Degradation of the T. weissflogii exudate alters the
   chemical composition of the DOM, which we attribute to differences in
   the reactivity of specific polysaccharides. The component within the
   exudate that most resembles seawater DOM has a slower degradation rate
   relative to the total polysaccharide fraction. Our study indicates that
   APS isolated from the surface ocean can have a direct algal source and
   that APS may accumulate in seawater as a result of its metabolic

Abstract = {{Bacterial biomass increased five-fold in the euphotic zone (from 450 to
   2250 mgC m-2) in response to the spring phytoplankton bloom in the
   eastern North Atlantic Ocean (Lat. 47-degrees-N, Long. 20-degrees-W) in
   1989. Bacterial biomass accounted for about 20-30\% of the particulate
   organic carbon (POC) above 50 m and a somewhat larger fraction in the
   layer below. Bacterial production averaged about 30\% of primary
   production and remained rather constant while the primary production
   varied from 600 to 1500 mgC m-2 day-1 in response to event-scale changes
   in irradiance. Thus bacterial production varied from 15 to 80\% of the
   concurrent primary production, with peaks occurring on overcast days
   when photosynthesis was low. Bacterial production in both the euphotic
   zone and the layer immediately below appeared to respond to the
   meteorologically-driven variations in photosynthesis with a time lag of
   3-4 days, consistent with estimates of turnover rates of 0.2 day-1. In
   the upper layer incorporation of dissolved free amino acids supported
   about 20\% of the production. The bacterial carbon demand at peak
   production required subsidies of carbon from the bulk POC and/or DOC
   pools. In the lower layer, decomposition of the vertical flux of sinking
   POC may have supported about half the mean production. Our bacterial
   production estimates for the 50-150 m layer are consistent with vertical
   flux estimates from drifting sediment traps and support other
   observations in suggesting that very large amounts of primary production
   pass through the DOC pool on short time-scales.
   Our observations suggest a spring-time North Atlantic condition for the
   microbial foodweb in which bacterial biomass makes up a relatively small
   part of the plankton carbon stock, but cycles rapidly (0.1-0.3 day-1)
   and commands a large share of the carbon cycling in the upper ocean.
   Through extensive metabolism of DOC and sinking POC in the upper 200 m,
   the bacterioplankton act as a selective gate through which some fraction
   of the products of primary production are exported into the oceanic
   interior.}},

Abstract = {{Microplastics are important novel pollutants in freshwaters but their
   behaviour in river sediments is poorly understood due to the large
   amounts of coloured dissolved organic matter that impede sample
   processing. The present study aimed to 1.) estimate the microplastic
   pollution dynamics in an urban river system experiencing temporal
   differences in river flow, and 2.) investigate the potential use of
   chironomids as indicators of microplastic pollution levels in degraded
   freshwater environments. Microplastic levels were estimated from
   sediment and Chironomus spp. larvae collected from various sites along
   the Bloukrans River system, in the Eastern Cape South Africa during the
   summer and winter season. River flow, water depth, channel width,
   substrate embeddedness and sediment organic matter were simultaneously
   collected from each site. The winter season was characterised by
   elevated microplastic abundances, likely as a result of lower energy and
   increased sediment deposition associated with reduced river flow. In
   addition, results showed that particle distribution may be governed by
   various other external factors, such as substrate type and sediment
   organic matter. The study further highlighted that deposit feeders
   associated with the benthic river habitats, namely Chironomus spp.
   ingest microplastics and that the seasonal differences in sediment
   microplastic dynamics were reflected in chironomid microplastic
   abundance. There was a positive, though weakly significant relationship
   between deposit feeders and sediment suggesting that deposit feeders
   such as Chironomus spp. larvae could serve as an important indicator of
   microplastic loads within freshwater ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Although it is commonly accepted that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of
   algal origin limits bacterial growth in pelagic systems, there are
   relatively few empirical studies documenting this effect. Depending on
   site and season, both organic and inorganic nutrients can limit the
   growth of freshwater bacteria. By contrast, inorganic nutrients have
   only recently been implicated as potentially growth-limiting for marine
   bacteria. At stations in the Gulf Stream, Sargasso, and Caribbean seas,
   we used a factorial experimental design to examine effects of inorganic
   (NH4 and PO4) and organic (glucose) nutrients on the uptake of thymidine
   and leucine and changes in bacterial abundance. Bacterial growth in
   seawater dilution cultures varied with station and treatment. Growth
   rates for the unamended controls (mean +/- SD = O.11 +/- 0.02 d(-1))
   were not significantly different among the stations or from the in situ
   rates. In the Caribbean Sea, additions of NH4 and PO4 resulted in a
   modest increase in growth rate (mu = 0.20-0.35 d(-1)), whereas glucose,
   either alone or in combination with PO4 and NH4, resulted in the largest
   increase (mu = 0.50 - 0.55 d(-1)). By contrast, in the Gulf Stream and
   Sargasso Sea the addition of glucose, either alone or in combination
   with NH4, resulted in the smallest increase in growth rate (mu = 0.2-0.4
   d(-1)), whereas the addition of PO4, either alone or in combination with
   glucose and NH4, resulted in the largest increase (mu = 0.55-0.60
   d(-1)). Growth rates in the PO4-amended seawater culture were 5-6-fold
   greater than the controls, suggesting that ambient concentrations of
   labile DOC were sufficient to sustain vigorous growth. We propose that
   PO4 limitation of bacterial growth may directly influence the
   accumulation of DOC in the surface layer and thus have a significant
   impact on carbon cycling in the sea. If bacterial growth were not
   constrained by inorganic nutrients, more DOC could be assimilated into
   bacterial biomass and subsequently transferred to protistan and metazoan
   grazers. At the third trophic step beyond bacteria, >90\% of the DOC
   initially assimilated would be released as CO2 and <5\% would be
   transferred to incorporated into bacterial biomass. Thus, when bacterial
   growth is P limited, the quantity of biogenic carbon (POC + DOC)
   exported to depth may be greater than would occur if DOC were first
   incorporated into bacterial biomass.}},

Abstract = {{This paper synthesizes current ideas on the role of the microbial loop
   in carbon fluxes in the ocean and proposes some directions for future
   research. Organic matter flux into bacteria is highly variable, which
   can significantly influence the pathways of carbon flow in the ocean. A
   goal for future research is to elucidate the mechanistic bases of
   bacteria-organic matter coupling. This research should take into
   consideration the micrometer-scale distribution of bacteria and the
   composition, structure, and dynamics of the organic matter field in the
   bacterium's microhabitat. The ideas on the interactions of bacteria with
   the particulate organic phase need to be revised in view of recent
   findings of highly abundant, previously unknown particles ranging in
   size from nanometers to hundreds of micrometers. The `'hot-spots'' in
   the distribution of organic matter and remineralized nutrients can
   influence the rates as well as the direction of biogeochemical fluxes.
   Slow-to-degrade dissolved organic matter (DOM) may be produced because
   of loose bacteria-organic matter coupling resulting in DON storage. Its
   use at a later time and place has profound implications for carbon
   fluxes and food web dynamics. A fundamental research need for the future
   is to understand the ecological interactions among the members of the
   microbial loop in an appropriate microhabitat context. While this goal
   was previously intractable, new molecular and optical techniques should
   make it possible to understand the biogeochemical activities of the
   microbial loop in terms of the ecology and evolution of pelagic
   microbial communities.}},

Abstract = {{About half the carbon fixed by phytoplankton in the ocean is taken up
   and metabolized by marine bacteria, a transfer that is mediated through
   the seawater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. The chemical
   complexity of marine DOC, along with a poor understanding of which
   compounds form the basis of trophic interactions between bacteria and
   phytoplankton, have impeded efforts to identify key currencies of this
   carbon cycle link. Here, we used transcriptional patterns in a
   bacterial-diatom model system based on vitamin B-12 auxotrophy as a
   sensitive assay for metabolite exchange between marine plankton. The
   most highly up-regulated genes (up to 374-fold) by a marine Roseobacter
   clade bacterium when cocultured with the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana
   were those encoding the transport and catabolism of
   2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHPS). This compound has no currently
   recognized role in the marine microbial food web. As the genes for DHPS
   catabolism have limited distribution among bacterial taxa, T. pseudonana
   may use this sulfonate for targeted feeding of beneficial associates.
   Indeed, DHPS was both a major component of the T. pseudonana cytosol and
   an abundant microbial metabolite in a diatom bloom in the eastern North
   Pacific Ocean. Moreover, transcript analysis of the North Pacific
   samples provided evidence of DHPS catabolism by Roseobacter populations.
   Other such biogeochemically important metabolites may be common in the
   ocean but difficult to discriminate against the complex chemical
   background of seawater. Bacterial transformation of this diatom-derived
   sulfonate represents a previously unidentified and likely sizeable link
   in both the marine carbon and sulfur cycles.}},

Abstract = {{The high-mountain lakes on the Yungui Plateau in China are exposed to
   high-intensity ultraviolet radiation, and contain low concentrations of
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). We determined CDOM
   absorption, fluorescence, composition, and source in 38 lakes on the
   Yungui Plateau at altitudes of 1516 to 4591 m above sea level. Total
   nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll a (Chl a)
   concentrations significantly increased with increasing trophic state,
   and decreased with altitude. The CDOM absorption coefficient
   a(CDOM)(280) significantly increased with increasing trophic state, but
   not with altitude. There were significant and negative correlations
   between altitude and TN, TP, Chl a concentrations, and a(CDOM)(280).
   Parallel factor analysis identified two humic-like and two protein-like
   fluorescent components. Humic-like component 1 was terrestrially derived
   and positively correlated to CDOM absorption. Component 2 was similar to
   a marine humic-like substance originating from biological degradation of
   phytoplankton. Components 3 and 4 were autochthonous tryptophan-like and
   tyrosine-like fluorophores. CDOM was, thus, a mixture of material from
   the catchment and autochthonous material produced by biota in the lake.
   CDOM fluorescence characteristics of oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes
   were dominated by the spectral signatures of protein-like components,
   but marine and terrestrial humic-like components dominated in eutrophic
   lakes. The fluorescence indices FI255, FI310, and FI370 were useful
   tools for readily defining and classifying CDOM characteristics in the
   Yungui Plateau lake waters.}},

Abstract = {{Trophic dynamics (community composition and feeding relationships) have
   been identified as important drivers of methylmercury (MeHg)
   bioaccumulation in lakes, reservoirs, and marine ecosystems. The
   relative importance of trophic dynamics and geochemical controls on MeHg
   bioaccumulation in streams, however, remains poorly characterized. MeHg
   bioaccumulation was evaluated in eight stream ecosystems across the
   United States (Oregon, Wisconsin, and Florida) spanning large ranges in
   climate, landscape characteristics, atmospheric Hg deposition, and
   stream chemistry. Across all geographic regions and all streams,
   concentrations of total Hg (THg) in top predator fish and forage fish,
   and MeHg in invertebrates, were strongly positively correlated to
   concentrations of filtered THg (FTHg), filtered MeHg (FMeHg), and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC); to DOC complexity (as measured by
   specific ultraviolet absorbance); and to percent wetland in the stream
   basins. Correlations were strongest for nonurban streams. Although
   regressions of log{[}Hg] versus delta N-15 indicate that Hg in biota
   increased significantly with increasing trophic position within seven of
   eight individual streams, Hg concentrations in top predator fish
   (including cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout; green sunfish; and
   largemouth bass) were not strongly influenced by differences in relative
   trophic position. Slopes of log{[}Hg] versus delta N-15, an indicator of
   the efficiency of trophic enrichment, ranged from 0.14 to 0.27 for all
   streams. These data suggest that, across the large ranges in FTHg
   (0.14-14.2 ng L-1), FMeHg (0.023-1.03 ng L-1), and DOC (0.50-61.0 mg
   L-1) found in this study, Hg contamination in top predator fish in
   streams likely is dominated by the amount of MeHg available for uptake
   at the base of the food web rather than by differences in the trophic
   position of top predator fish.}},

Journal = {{AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-77}},
Abstract = {{Microbial food webs, which comprise phototrophic picoplankton (or
   ultraplankton), heterotrophic bacteria and protozoa, are ubiquitous in
   marine waters. Members of the microbial food web may play various roles
   in the export of biogenic carbon. For example, it has been postulated
   that high bacterial activity may sometimes prevent a significant
   fraction of the production by large phytoplankton from reaching metazoan
   consumers. Phototrophic or heterotrophic small plankton cells may be
   readily exported (i.e. biological CO2 pump) if incorporated into large
   particles, through either endosymbiosis with larger cells, or
   development on material accumulated in hydrodynamic traps, or inclusion
   into marine snow, or grazing by large planktonic microphages (e.g.
   salps) and incorporation in their sometimes fast-sinking faecal pellets.
   Another aspect is the export of carbonate by members of the microbial
   food web (e.g. coccolithophores, foraminifera), which influences the
   carbon dioxide balance of the ocean (i.e. carbonate pump). Finally,
   carbon bound into refractory dissolved organic matter is chemically
   sequestered in the upper ocean, before being exported to depth. The
   activity of microbial food webs may therefore influence in several ways
   the export (and sequestration) of biogenic carbon in oceans.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) contains a complex array of chemical
   components that are intimately linked to many environmental processes,
   including the global carbon cycle, and the fate and transport of
   chemical pollutants. Despite its importance, fundamental aspects, such
   as the structural components in DOM remain elusive, due in part to the
   molecular complexity of the material. Here, we utilize multidimensional
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to demonstrate the major
   structural components in Lake Ontario DOM. These include carboxyl-rich
   alicyclic molecules (CRAM), heteropolysaccharides, and aromatic
   compounds, which are consistent with components recently identified in
   marine dissolved organic matter (1). In addition, long-range
   proton-carbon correlations are obtained for DOM, which support the
   existence of material derived from linear terpenoids (MOLT). It is
   tentatively suggested that the bulk of freshwater dissolved organic
   matter is aliphatic in nature, with CRAM derived from cyclic terpenoids,
   and MOLT derived from linear terpenoids. This is in agreement with
   previous reports which indicate terpenoids as major precursors of DOM
   (2). At this time it is not clear in Lake Ontario whether these
   precursors are of terrestrial or aquatic origin or whether
   transformations proceed via biological and/or photochemical processes.}},

Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{309-320}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The extent and mechanisms of adsorption of marine pore water organic
   matter to montmorillonite were studied in a series of batch and
   sequential adsorption experiments. Pore water natural organic matter
   (pNOM) and easily extracted natural organic matter (eNOM) were collected
   from Liberty Bay (Puget Sound, WA, USA) sediments. The pNOM and eNOM
   were each divided into two size fractions using a 1000 D ultrafilter.
   Batch adsorption isotherms were approximately linear, and the > 1000 D
   fractions of both pNOM and eNOM had larger partition coefficients (K-d)
   than the < 1000 D fractions. A two-component fit of the sequential
   adsorption data indicated that pNOM and eNOM contained a similar amount
   of NOM (30\%) that was not surface reactive toward montmorillonite.
   After correcting the batch adsorption K(d)s for the non-reactive
   components, the K(d)s estimated by batch and sequential adsorption were
   identical (similar to 2.7 l/kg for > 1000 D pNOM and eNOM, and similar
   to 1.6 l/kg for < 1000 D pNOM and eNOM). Mechanisms of adsorption were
   investigated by systematically changing conditions (pH, temperature and
   ionic composition) of > 1000 D fractions during batch isotherm
   experiments. Adsorption of NOM was found to decrease with increased
   temperature, suggesting that hydrophobic effects were not the dominant
   adsorption mechanisms in this system. Ion exchange was also not an
   important adsorption mechanism because adsorption increased with ionic
   strength. The observed enhancement in adsorption with ionic strength
   indicated that van der Waals interactions were important in the
   adsorption of NOM. Ligand exchange was found to be a significant
   mechanism since the presence of SO42- in solution reduced the amount of
   NOM adsorbed. Ca2+ enhanced adsorption slightly more than Na+,
   suggesting that cation bridging was involved. The relative contributions
   of van der Waals interactions, ligand exchange and cation bridging were
   estimated to be approximately 60\%, 35\% and 5\%, respectively, for
   adsorption of NOM in a CaCl2 solution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title = {{Coupled transport and reaction kinetics control the nitrate source-sink
   function of hyporheic zones}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{The fate of biologically available nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in stream
   ecosystems is controlled by the coupling of physical transport and
   biogeochemical reaction kinetics. However, determining the relative role
   of physical and biogeochemical controls at different temporal and
   spatial scales is difficult. The hyporheic zone (HZ), where
   groundwater-stream water mix, can be an important location controlling N
   and C transformations because it creates strong gradients in both the
   physical and biogeochemical conditions that control redox
   biogeochemistry. We evaluated the coupling of physical transport and
   biogeochemical redox reactions by linking an advection, dispersion, and
   residence time model with a multiple Monod kinetics model simulating the
   concentrations of oxygen (O-2), ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We used global Monte Carlo sensitivity
   analyses with a nondimensional form of the model to examine coupled
   nitrification-denitrification dynamics across many scales of transport
   and reaction conditions. Results demonstrated that the residence time of
   water in the HZ and the uptake rate of O-2 from either respiration
   and/or nitrification determined whether the HZ was a source or a sink of
   NO3 to the stream. We further show that whether the HZ is a net NO3
   source or net NO3 sink is determined by the ratio of the characteristic
   transport time to the characteristic reaction time of O-2 (i.e., the
   Damkohler number, Da(O2)), where HZs with Da(O2) < 1 will be net
   nitrification environments and HZs with Da(O2) << 1 will be net
   denitrification environments. Our coupling of the hydrologic and
   biogeochemical limitations of N transformations across different
   temporal and spatial scales within the HZ allows us to explain the
   widely contrasting results of previous investigations of HZ N dynamics
   which variously identify the HZ as either a net source or sink of NO3.
   Our model results suggest that only estimates of residence times and O-2
   uptake rates are necessary to predict this nitrification-denitrification
   threshold and, ultimately, whether a HZ will be either a net source or
   sink of NO3.}},

Abstract = {{Phytoplankton concentrate mercury from their aqueous surroundings and
   represent the primary entry point for Hg in aquatic food webs. We used
   Hg-203 to compare the uptake of inorganic mercury, Hg(II), and
   methylmercury, MeHg, in four phytoplankton species (a diatom, a
   chlorophyte, a cryptophyte, and a cyanobacterium) in two waters
   containing different concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
   At steady state, volume concentration factors (VCFs) for Hg(II) in the
   four species were similar and ranged from 0.5 to 5 x 10(4) for both
   water types, whereas VCFs for MeHg exceeded those for Hg(II) and ranged
   from 1.3 to 14.6 x 10(5). The VCFs for MeHg in the three eukaryotic
   cells in the high DOC water were 2-2.6 times greater than those in the
   low DOC water, but the VCFs for the prokaryote were similar in both
   waters. Higher cell surface area to volume ratios correlated with
   increased MeHg concentrations but not with Hg(II). In both water types,
   VCFs of Hg(II) were similar for living and heat-killed cells, but the
   VCFs of MeHg were 1.5-5.0 times greater in living cells, suggesting an
   active uptake component for MeHg. Hg(II) and MeHg were entirely bound to
   cell surfaces of the dead cells, whereas 59-64\% of the MeHg and 9-16\%
   of the Hg(II) in living cells entered the cytoplasm.}},

Title = {{Dependence of the Cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus on Hydrogen Peroxide
   Scavenging Microbes for Growth at the Ocean's Surface}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{The phytoplankton community in the oligotrophic open ocean is
   numerically dominated by the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, accounting
   for approximately half of all photosynthesis. In the illuminated
   euphotic zone where Prochlorococcus grows, reactive oxygen species are
   continuously generated via photochemical reactions with dissolved
   organic matter. However, Prochlorococcus genomes lack catalase and
   additional protective mechanisms common in other aerobes, and this genus
   is highly susceptible to oxidative damage from hydrogen peroxide (HOOH).
   In this study we showed that the extant microbial community plays a
   vital, previously unrecognized role in cross-protecting Prochlorococcus
   from oxidative damage in the surface mixed layer of the oligotrophic
   ocean. Microbes are the primary HOOH sink in marine systems, and in the
   absence of the microbial community, surface waters in the Atlantic and
   Pacific Ocean accumulated HOOH to concentrations that were lethal for
   Prochlorococcus cultures. In laboratory experiments with the marine
   heterotroph Alteromonas sp., serving as a proxy for the natural
   community of HOOH-degrading microbes, bacterial depletion of HOOH from
   the extracellular milieu prevented oxidative damage to the cell envelope
   and photosystems of co-cultured Prochlorococcus, and facilitated the
   growth of Prochlorococcus at ecologically-relevant cell concentrations.
   Curiously, the more recently evolved lineages of Prochlorococcus that
   exploit the surface mixed layer niche were also the most sensitive to
   HOOH. The genomic streamlining of these evolved lineages during
   adaptation to the high-light exposed upper euphotic zone thus appears to
   be coincident with an acquired dependency on the extant HOOH-consuming
   community. These results underscore the importance of (indirect) biotic
   interactions in establishing niche boundaries, and highlight the impacts
   that community-level responses to stress may have in the ecological and
   evolutionary outcomes for co-existing species.}},

Abstract = {{The Lena River is one of the most important rivers flowing to the Arctic
   Ocean. Draining the Siberian forest and tundra, it is characterized by
   black waters enriched in organic matter. Compared to other Arctic or
   subarctic rivers, the Lena River is very similar in the content of
   ammonia, phosphates, organic nitrogen and phosphorus, but three times
   richer in silica and nitrate. The distribution of POC, DOG, DIC and
   suspended matter during two cruises in September 1989 and 1991 was
   comparable and was influenced by the water input from the river. DOC and
   DIC exhibit a very conservative behaviour to salinity. The TOC
   discharge, is on a yearly basis directly connected to water discharge
   with a maximum during the flood time in June-July. From about 330 mu M
   during the low stage period (November to April), the TOC concentration
   increases up to 1200 mu M during the flood.
   The organic carbon content of suspended matter depends upon the level
   sampled and decreases with the suspended load. Surface samples range
   between 4 and 20\% while samples collected in bottom waters are less
   rich (6 to 3\%). Waters from the Buor-Khaya Bay are richer (20 to 10\%).
   The concentrations of the nutrients (SiO2, PO4, TDP, TDN, NH4, NO3) are
   different in surface and bottom waters, and vary from summer to winter.
   Plotted against chlorinity, these parameters exhibit a characteristic
   behaviour. Silica is always more concentrated in bottom water,
   decreasing with salinity. Phosphate and nitrate are more concentrated in
   bottom water, suggesting mineralization of organic matter and
   regeneration of nutrients. On the contrary, ammonium is more
   concentrated in surface water. Total dissolved nitrogen, mainly
   represented by organic nitrogen (DON), is decreasing rapidly in summer
   at low salinities (0-2 parts per thousand), and slowly increases
   seawards. In winter the concentration is not lower but slowly decreases
   all along the salinity gradient.
   The behaviour of organic carbon and nutrients are linked to the inputs
   by the river and marine production and to the degradation step in the
   sediment.}},

Abstract = {{Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is one of the most heterogeneous
   and largest pools of reactive carbon on earth, rivaling in mass the
   carbon in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, the molecular-level
   composition of marine DOM has eluded detailed description, impeding
   inquiry into the specific mechanisms that add or remove compounds from
   the DOM pool. Here we describe the molecular-level composition of
   C(18)-extracted DOM along an east-west transect of the North Atlantic
   Ocean. We examine the changes in DOM composition along this transect
   with ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and multivariate statistics.
   We use indicator species analysis (ISA) to identify possible source
   markers for photochemical degradation and heterotrophic bacterial
   metabolism. The inclusion of ISA in statistical evaluation of DOM mass
   spectral data allows investigators to determine the m/z values
   associated with significant changes in DOM composition. With this
   technique, we observe indicator m/z values in estuarine water that may
   represent components of terrestrially-derived chromophoric DOM subject
   to photochemical degradation. We also observe a unique set of m/z values
   in surface seawater and show that many of these are present in pure
   cultures of the marine alpha-proteobacterium ``Candidatus Pelagibacter
   ubique{''} when grown in natural seawater. These findings indicate that
   a complex balance of abiotic and biotic processes controls the molecular
   composition of marine DOM to produce signatures that are characteristic
   of different environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in sediment pore waters from
   contrasting sites in the Chesapeake Bay and along the mid-Atlantic
   shelf/slope break was studied using three-dimensional fluorescence
   spectroscopy. Benthic fluxes of FDOM were also examined at the
   Chesapeake Bay sites. The major fluorescence peaks observed in these
   pore waters corresponded to those observed in the water column. These
   included peaks ascribed to the fluorescence of humic-like material
   (peaks A, C and M), as well as protein-like peaks that appear to result
   from the fluorescence of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan and
   tyrosine. In these pore waters we also observed a fourth humic-like
   fluorescence peak (A'). These four humic-like peaks appeared to occur in
   pairs (peaks A and M in one pair and peaks A' and C in another pair)
   with near identical emission maxima but different excitation maxima.
   Peaks A' and C were red shifted relative to peaks A and M.
   Humic-like fluorescence increased with sediment depth at almost all
   stations, and was closely correlated with total DOC. This fluorescence
   appeared to be a tracer for the refractory, relatively low molecular
   weight pore water DOM that accumulates with depth during sediment
   diagenesis. Fluorescence-DOC relationships indicated that larger
   relative amounts of humic-like FDOM were seen in anoxic sediments versus
   sub-oxic or mixed redox sediments. By extension, these observations
   suggest that refractory humic-like compounds (in general) are
   preferentially preserved in sediment pore waters under anoxic
   conditions. A simple conceptual model is presented here which proposes
   that different types of organic matter (e.g., marine vs. terrestrial) as
   well as internal transformations of DOM or FDOM may lead to the
   occurrence of these humic-like fluorophores. This model is consistent
   with a wide range of data on FDOM in marine as well as freshwater
   systems. Protein-like fluorescence showed no coherent depth trends in
   sediment pore waters, other than the fact that pore water fluorescence
   intensities were greater than bottom water values. Protein-like
   fluorescence in pore waters may be associated with refractory DOM,
   although this observation is somewhat equivocal. In contrast, the
   results of benthic flux studies suggested that here protein-like
   fluorescence was associated with reactive DOM intermediates of organic
   matter diagenesis (e.g., dissolved peptides and proteins) produced near
   the sediment-water interface. Furthermore, the interplay between
   transport processes and the depth zonation of DOM cycling in
   bioirrigated sediments leads to molecular diffusion (rather than
   bioirrigation) playing a much more important role in transporting
   protein-like fluorescence out of the sediments. In contrast,
   bioirrigation dominates sediment-water exchange of humic-like
   fluorescence (and therefore most DOC in general). Finally, benthic flux
   studies indicated that sediments represent a source of chromophoric DOM
   to coastal waters, although further work will be needed to quantify
   their significance in terms of other known sources of this material
   (e.g., riverine input, phytoplankton degradation products). (C) 2004

Abstract = {{We determined the concentrations and compositions of coarse particulate

   organic matter collected along a river reach extending from a
   first-order stream in the Bolivian Andes, through the Beni River system,
   to the lower Madeira and Amazon Rivers. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   concentrations increased down the total reach from similar to 80 to 350
   muM. The percentage of total DOC with a molecular weight greater than
   similar to1,000 atomic mass units that could be isolated by
   ultrafiltration also increased downstream from 40 to 80\%. Weight
   percentages of organic carbon in the ultrafiltered isolates also grew
   downstream from 5\% at the uppermost station to 37\% in the Amazon
   mainstem. Organic carbon composed only 0.4-1.2 weight percentage of the
   total mass of the fine particulate fraction, which accounted for 70-80\%
   of the total organic carbon (TOC) in transport through the highly turbid
   (similar to 600-2000 mg L-l) Beni sequence. Observed compositional
   differences were related primarily to the size fractions in which the
   organic matter occurred. On average, coarse particulate organic material
   exhibited an atomic C:N of 24, whereas ultrafiltered DOM was nitrogen
   poor, (C:N)a = 34, and fine particulate material was nitrogen rich,
   (C:N)a = 15. The lignin and stable-carbon isotopic compositions of these
   fractions indicate tree leaves and other nonwoody tissues from C3 land
   plants as predominant sources. Three molecular parameters demonstrate
   that the coarse, fine, and dissolved fractions of individual water
   samples are increasingly degraded downstream. Elemental nitrogen, amino
   acids, and basic amino acids are all preferentially associated with fine
   minerals. Observed geographical patterns included more positive delta
   (13)C values in particulate organic matter from high altitude sites and
   an increase in the abundance and degradation of ultrafiltered dissolved
   organic matter down the drainage system. Many of these compositional
   patterns are imprinted within materials carried by low-order,

Abstract = {{Compositions and fluxes of amino acids and major chloropigments were
   measured in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean as part of the US JGOFS
   EqPac program, Fluxes decreased by several orders of magnitude, from 400
   to 0.03 mg amino acid m(-2) d(-1) and from 9 mg to 0.0004 mu g
   chloropigment m(-2) d(-1), between production in the surface waters and
   accumulation at the sea Boor, Most rapid losses were in surface waters
   and at the sediment interface. Losses from the mid-water column were as
   great as those in surface waters or at the sediment interface, but
   occurred over a much greater depth range, Export flux estimates based on
   Boating sediment traps were higher near the equator and decreased
   poleward, similar to primary production.
   Little meridional difference was apparent in composition of either amino
   acids or pigments in exported material over the 24 degrees of latitude
   sampled in spite of the large (factor of 5-6) difference in fluxes.
   However, pigment composition changed dramatically with depth in the
   water column, and considerable diagenesis occurred before particles
   reached the sediment. Pigment compositions suggest that suspended
   particles were more degraded in the northern than in the southern
   hemisphere, possibly due to differences in food chain structure.
   Compositional changes in amino acids occurred in the water column, but
   were most noticeable at the sediment-seawater interface. Increases in
   the relative proportions of aspartic acid and glycine with depth were
   more consistent with preferential preservation within the particulate
   matrix than with any inherent stability of these compounds to
   heterotrophic consumption, The contribution of amino acids and pigments
   to total organic carbon clearly shows that selective degradation of
   organic matter occurs with depth; this is not evident from total organic
   carbon data alone. Amino acids contributed about a quarter of the total
   organic carbon (OC) in surface waters and 16\% of the OC in sediment;
   pigments decreased from 1\% of total OC in surface waters to < 0.001\%
   in sediments. Decreases in the contribution of amino acids to total
   organic carbon map be due to transformation into uncharacterizeable
   material as well as to respiration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A novel approach for the analysis of lignin in geochemical samples has
   been developed as an alternative to the alkaline CuO oxidation procedure
   first developed in 1982. The new procedure utilizes microwave digestion
   technology, as opposed to conductive heating, to carry out oxidative
   hydrolysis of six samples in an oxygen-free atmosphere at 150 degrees C
   for 90 min. Ethyl acetate is used as the extraction solvent in place of
   diethyl ether. Additionally, the new method incorporates a simplified
   extraction procedure that minimizes solvent handling and the amount of
   glassware needed. Under these novel conditions, the yields and
   compositions of lignin phenols from four different samples (modern and
   ancient sediments; woody and nonwoody tissues) match those obtained by
   the ``traditional{''} procedure. The significant advantages of this new
   alkaline CuO oxidation method include faster reaction times, the ability
   to accurately measure and control reaction conditions, added flexibility
   for the analyst, and a marked increase in the achievable sample

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Hydrothermal venting associated with mid-ocean ridge volcanism is
   globally widespread(1). This venting is responsible for a dissolved iron
   flux to the ocean that is approximately equal to that associated with
   continental riverine runoff(2). For hydrothermal fluxes, it has long
   been assumed that most of the iron entering the oceans is precipitated
   in inorganic forms. However, the possibility of globally significant
   fluxes of iron escaping these mass precipitation events and entering
   open-ocean cycles is now being debated(3), and two recent studies
   suggest that dissolved organic ligands might influence the fate of
   hydrothermally vented metals(4,5). Here we present spectromicroscopic
   measurements of iron and carbon in hydrothermal plume particles at the
   East Pacific Rise mid-ocean ridge. We show that organic carbon-rich
   matrices, containing evenly dispersed iron(II)-rich materials, are
   pervasive in hydrothermal plume particles. The absence of discrete
   iron(II) particles suggests that the carbon and iron associate through
   sorption or complexation. We suggest that these carbon matrices
   stabilize iron(II) released from hydrothermal vents in the region,
   preventing its oxidation and/or precipitation as insoluble minerals. Our
   findings have implications for deep-sea biogeochemical cycling of iron,
   a widely recognized limiting nutrient in the oceans.}},

Abstract = {{Continental shelf sediments of the central Chile upwelling area are
   dominated by the presence of dense mats of the filamentous,
   sulfur-depositing bacterium Thioploca spp. We examined rates and
   pathways of S and methane cycling in these sediments along a transect
   from the Bay of Concepcion to the continental slope. Sulfate reduction
   rates (170-4670 nmol cm(-3) d(-1)) were equal to or exceeded rates
   reported for other subtidal marine sediments. Elemental S and pyrite
   were the dominant endproducts of sulfate reduction in Thioploca mats on
   the continental shelf, whereas, in the highly-reducing,
   Beggintoa-dominated sediments of the nearby Bay of Concepcion,
   acid-volatile S was the principal end-product. Dissolved organic C
   values were lowest at the stations with the highest sulfate reduction
   rates and increased offshore. Sediment porewater methane concentrations
   in all surface sediments were low (<12 nmol cm(-3)), and methane
   production rates at the station most dominated by Thioploca were
   extremely low (<0.5 nmol cm(-3) d(-1)). Low methane production rates and
   concentrations were matched by low methane oxidation rates (<0.1 nmol
   cm(-3) d(-1)). Radio-tracer studies showed that methane production was
   almost exclusively from methylamines, substrates which are
   noncompetitive with sulfate reduction, rather than from acetate or
   CO2/H-2. Bacterial MPN (most probable number) counts also indicated the
   presence of a methylotrophic population of methanogens. Surprisingly,
   high numbers of DOC degradation is more complex than expected. In spite
   of the high sulfate reduction rates, sulfide concentrations in the shelf
   and slope were low or undetectable (<0.5 mu M), and sulfate
   concentrations were never depleted below bottom water levels down to
   depths of 25-30 cm. Calculations suggest that Thioploca were oxidizing a
   maximum of 35\% of sulfide production-not enough to prevent sulfate
   depletion. Either other sulfide oxidizers were also present or transient
   hydrodynamic conditions coupled with bioturbation resulted in oxidation
   of the sediments. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Photobleaching of open-ocean dissolved organic matter (DOM) is typically
   treated as a removal mechanism; however, photobleaching also encompasses
   a poorly characterized suite of transformative processes. To examine the
   qualitative changes to DOM optical properties during photobleaching, 674
   m N. Pacific DOM, concentrated and desalted by reverse osmosis with
   electrodialysis (RO/ED), was subjected to 68 days of continuous
   irradiation in a UV solar simulator. Approximately 84\% of chromophoric
   and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM respectively) and 38\% of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) were lost during the irradiation. Based on these
   results the concentration of photochemically refractory DOC in the
   surface pacific is estimated to be 27 mu mol of carbon per liter. In
   addition, the spectra of the remaining CDOM and FDOM were shifted
   towards shorter wavelengths, a result which has important implications
   for the interpretation of fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM)
   spectra because the relative positions of fluorescence maxima are often
   attributed to differences in FDOM source. Qualitative indices derived
   from CDOM and FDOM spectra for the irradiated deep DOM sample resembled
   those for surface waters of the North Pacific Ocean indicating that
   photobleaching has a significant influence upon the optical properties
   of DOM in the open ocean. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{SAR11 bacteria are abundant in marine environments, often accounting for
   35\% of total prokaryotes in the surface ocean, but little is known
   about their involvement in marine biogeochemical cycles. Previous
   studies reported that SAR11 bacteria are very small and potentially have
   few ribosomes, indicating that SAR11 bacteria could have low metabolic
   activities and could play a smaller role in the flux of dissolved
   organic matter than suggested by their abundance. To determine the
   ecological activity of SAR11 bacteria, we used a combination of
   microautoradiography and fluorescence in situ hybridization (Micro-FISH)
   to measure assimilation of (3)H-amino acids and
   {[}(35)S]dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) by SAR11 bacteria in the
   coastal North Atlantic Ocean and the Sargasso Sea. We found that SAR11
   bacteria were often abundant in surface waters, accounting for 25\% of
   all prokaryotes on average. SAR11 bacteria were typically as large as,
   if not larger than, other prokaryotes. Additionally, more than half of
   SAR11 bacteria assimilated dissolved amino acids and DMSP, whereas about
   40\% of other prokaryotes assimilated these compounds. Due to their high
   abundance and activity, SAR11 bacteria were responsible for about 50\%
   of amino acid assimilation and 30\% of DMSP assimilation in surface
   waters. The contribution of SAR11 bacteria to amino acid assimilation
   was greater than would be expected based on their overall abundance,
   implying that SAR11 bacteria outcompete other prokaryotes for these
   labile compounds. These data suggest that SAR11 bacteria are highly
   active and play a significant role in C, N, and S cycling in the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Presence of plastic debris in marine and freshwater ecosystems is
   increasingly reported. Previous research suggested plastic debris had a
   strong affiliation for many pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and heavy metals.
   In this study, the sorption behavior of pharmaceuticals and personal
   care products (PPCPs), including carbamazepine (CBZ),
   4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4MBC), triclosan (TCS), and 17
   alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), to polyethylene (PE) debris (250 to 280
   mu m) was investigated. The estimated linear sorption coefficients (K-d)
   are 191.4, 311.5, 5140, and 53,225 L/kg for CBZ, EE2, TCS, and 4MBC, and
   are related to their hydrophobicities. Increase of salinity from 0.05 to
   3.5 \% did not affect the sorption of 4MBC, CBZ, and EE2 but enhanced
   the sorption of TCS, likely due to the salting-out effect. Increase of
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) content using Aldrich humic acid (HA) as
   a proxy reduced the sorption of 4MBC, EE2, and TCS, all of which show a
   relatively strong affiliation to HA. Results from this work suggest that
   microplastics may play an important role in the fate and transport of
   PPCPs, especially for those hydrophobic ones.}},

Abstract = {{P>Coastal ocean bacterioplankton control the flow of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) from terrestrial and oceanic sources into the marine food
   web, and regulate the release of inorganic carbon to atmospheric and
   offshore reservoirs. While the fate of the chemically complex coastal
   DOC reservoir has long been recognized as a critical feature of the
   global carbon budget, it has been problematic to identify both the
   compounds that serve as major conduits for carbon flux and the roles of
   individual bacterioplankton taxa in mediating that flux. Here we analyse
   random libraries of expressed genes from a coastal bacterial community
   to identify sequences representing DOC-transporting proteins. Predicted
   substrates of expressed transporter genes indicated that carboxylic
   acids, compatible solutes, polyamines and lipids may be key components
   of the biologically labile DOC pool in coastal waters, in addition to
   canonical bacterial substrates such as amino acids, oligopeptides and
   carbohydrates. Half of the expressed DOC transporter sequences in this
   coastal ocean appeared to originate from just eight taxa: Roseobacter,
   SAR11, Flavobacteriales and five orders of gamma-Proteobacteria. While
   all major taxa expressed transporter genes for some DOC components (e.g.
   amino acids), there were indications of specialization within the
   bacterioplankton community for others (e.g. carbohydrates, carboxylic
   acids and polyamines). Experimental manipulations of the natural DOC
   pool that increased the concentration of phytoplankton- or vascular
   plant-derived compounds invoked a readily measured response in bacterial
   transporter gene expression. This highly resolved view of the potential
   for carbon flux into heterotrophic bacterioplankton cells identifies
   possible bioreactive components of the coastal DOC pool and highlights
   differing ecological roles in carbon turnover for the resident bacterial
   taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Variability in chromophoric dissolved organic carbon (CDOM) was
   characterized in and around the Cape Fear River and Onslow Bay, North
   Carolina USA. The river end member of the study is extremely rich in
   CDOM, thus the Cape Fear River serves as a point source of CDOM-rich
   water into the southeastern Atlantic bight. The river plume is easily
   traceable and generally extends in a southwesterly direction along the
   coastline into Long Bay. Depending on physical processes and river flow,
   the plume can meander somewhat and may even turn northward for short
   periods of time. The oceanic end member of this study was the Gulf
   Stream. Samples from the Gulf Stream were obtained up to 97 km off
   shore. The experimental approach focused on the qualitative and
   quantitative description of CDOM from fresh-to-oceanic waters. CDOM was
   characterized by excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and
   UV/VIS spectroscopy. Variability of CDOM absorption in the relatively
   small area of the Cape Fear River estuary and surrounding coastal ocean
   was very high. The observed range of variability of CDOM absorption
   coefficient, a(CDOM)(350), extended over nearly the entire range of CDOM
   absorption in the literature: 0.046 = a(CDOM)(350) = 29.9 m(-1). Changes
   in CDOM absorption spectrum slope coefficient S, were small in the Cape
   Fear River plume area, but relatively large in Onslow Bay. CDOM EEM
   spectra indicated that a radical change in composition of CDOM occurs
   along the river-to-oceanic salinity gradient. CDOM in the coastal ocean
   was characterized by strong reduction of the three principal intensity
   peaks: A, C, and M, and a prominent contribution of the T peak to the
   fluorescence spectrum. The fluorescence intensity is linearly related
   with absorption. There is a strong inverse relationship between salinity
   and CDOM absorption. The distribution of the slope coefficient and the
   percent contribution of respective peak intensities to the total EEM
   intensity showed that CDOM undergoes conservative mixing until it
   approached oceanic salinity. Thus, CDOM is so concentrated in the river
   that mixing and other physical processes mask photochemical or
   biological alteration of its composition.}},

Abstract = {{Plastic debris is accumulating in agricultural land due to the increased
   use of plastic mulches, which is causing serious environmental problems,
   especially for biochemical and physical properties of the soil.
   Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a central role in driving soil
   biogeochemistry, but little information is available on the effects of
   plastic residues, especially microplastic, on soil DOM. We conducted a
   soil-incubation experiment in a climate-controlled chamber with three
   levels of microplastic added to loess soil collected from the Loess
   Plateau in China: 0\% (control, CK), 7\% (M1) and 28\% (M2) (w/w). We
   analysed the soil contents of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved
   organic nitrogen (DON), NH4+, NOT, dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP),
   and PO43- and the activities of fluorescein diacetate hydrolase (FDAse)
   and phenol oxidase. The higher level of microplastic addition
   significantly increased the nutrient contents of the DOM solution. The
   lower level of addition had no significant effect on the DOM solution
   during the first seven days, but the rate of DOM decomposition decreased
   in M1 between days 7 and 30, which increased the nutrient contents. The
   microplastic facilitated the accumulation of high-molecular weight
   humic-like material between days 7 and 30. The DOM solutions were mainly
   comprised of high molecular-weight humic-like material in CK and Ml and
   of high-molecular-weight humic-like material and tyrosine-like material
   in M2. The Microplastic stimulated the activities of both enzymes.
   Microplastic addition thus stimulated enzymatic activity, activated
   pools of organic C, N, and P, and was beneficial for the accumulation of
   dissolved organic C, N and P. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A consistent observation of river waters in the Amazon Basin and
   elsewhere is that suspended fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) is
   compositionally distinct from coexisting dissolved organic matter (DOM).
   The present article presents experimental results that show that at
   least some of these compositional patterns are the outcome of selective
   partitioning of nitrogen-rich DOM components onto mineral surfaces. Nine
   laboratory experiments were conducted in which natural DOM from two
   rivers, one wetland, and two leachates from the Peruvian Amazon were
   mixed with natural suspended riverine minerals or organic-free
   kaolinite. Concentrations of organic carbon, organic nitrogen, and
   hydrolyzable amino acids were measured in both dissolved and particulate
   phases before and after mixing. In each of these trials, nitrogen was
   preferentially taken into the particulate fraction relative to the
   ``parent{''} DOM, as were total hydrolyzable amino acids with respect to
   total organic carbon and nitrogen. Amino acid compositional patterns
   also indicated preferential sorption of basic amino acids, with
   positively charged nitrogen side chains, to the negatively charged
   aluminosilicate clay minerals. In short, sorption of natural DOM to
   minerals reproduced all contrasting organic nitrogen compositional
   patterns observed in the Amazon Basin. Although previously conjectured
   from FPOM-DOM compositional trends from river samples, this is the first
   direct evidence for preferential uptake of naturally occurring
   nitrogenous DOM by suspended riverine minerals. Last, nonprotein amino
   acids, which are commonly used as diagenetic indicators in sediments,
   preferentially remained dissolved, which suggests that sorptive
   fractionation may significantly complicate comparisons of FPOM and DOM
   diagenesis on the basis of interpretation of organic composition.}},

Title = {{Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on
   biogeochemical cycling}},
Journal = {{PHOTOCHEMICAL \& PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{286-300}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This report assesses research on the interactions of UV radiation
   (280-400 nm) and global climate change with global biogeochemical cycles
   at the Earth's surface. The effects of UV-B (280-315 nm), which ate
   dependent on the stratospheric ozone layer, on biogeochemical cycles are
   often linked to concurrent exposure to UV-A radiation (315-400 nm),
   which is influenced by global climate change. These interactions
   involving UV radiation (the combination of UV-B and UV-A) are central to
   the prediction and evaluation of future Earth environmental conditions.
   There is increasing evidence that elevated UV-B radiation has
   significant effects on the terrestrial biosphere with implications for
   the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and other elements. The cycling of
   carbon and inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen can be affected by
   UV-B-mediated changes in communities of soil organisms, probably due to
   the effects of UV-B radiation on plant root exudation and/or the
   chemistry of dead plant material falling to the soil. In and
   environments direct photodegraclation can play a major role in the decay
   of plant litter, and UV-B radiation is responsible for a significant
   part of this photodegraclation. UV-B radiation strongly influences
   aquatic carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and metals cycling that affect a wide
   range of life processes. UV-B radiation changes the biological
   availability of dissolved organic matter to microorganisms, and
   accelerates its transformation into dissolved inorganic carbon and
   nitrogen, including carbon dioxide and ammonium. The coloured part of
   dissolved organic matter (CDOM) controls the penetration of UV radiation
   into water bodies, but CDOM is also photodegraded by solar UV radiation.
   Changes in CDOM influence the penetration of UV radiation into water
   bodies with major consequences for aquatic biogeochemical processes.
   Changes in aquatic primary productivity and decomposition due to
   climate-related changes in circulation and nutrient supply occur
   concurrently with exposure to increased UV-B radiation, and have
   synergistic effects on the penetration of light into aquatic:
   ecosystems. Future changes in climate will enhance stratification of
   lakes and the ocean, which will intensify photodegradation of CDOM by UV
   radiation. The resultant increase in the transparency of water bodies
   may increase UV-B effects on aquatic biogeochemistry in the surface
   layer. Changing solar UV radiation and climate also interact to
   influence exchanges of trace gases, such as halocarbons (e.g., methyl
   bromide) which influence ozone depletion, and sulfur gases (e.g.,
   dimethylsulfide) that oxidize to produce sulfate aerosols that cool the
   marine atmosphere. UV radiation affects the biological availability of
   iron, copper and other trace metals in aquatic environments thus
   potentially affecting metal toxicity and the growth of phytoplankton and
   other microorganisms that are involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling.
   Future changes in ecosystem distribution due to alterations in the
   physical and chemical climate interact with ozone-modulated changes in
   UV-B radiation. These interactions between the effects of climate change
   and UV-B radiation on biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial and aquatic,
   systems may partially offset the beneficial effects of an ozone
   recovery.}},

Abstract = {{The microbial loop in flowing waters is dependent on allochthonous
   sources of carbon, which vary in quality. The proportion of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) that can be degraded ranges from <1 to over 50\%,
   and the bioavailability of DOC (micrograms bacterial biomass produced
   per milligram DOC present) ranges over two orders of magnitude.
   Bioavailability of DOC is predictable from the ratio of H/C and O/C of
   the DOC, but further work is needed to develop simple predictors of
   bioavailability of DOC in a range of environments. Consumers of bacteria
   in streams range in size from protists to insect larvae, with highest
   rates of bacterial consumption found among the meiofauna and certain
   filter feeders and grazers. Because there appear to be fewer trophic
   transfers in the lotic microbial loop, it functions more as a link in
   flowing waters than it appears to do in the marine plankton.}},

Title = {{Characterizing chromophoric dissolved organic matter in Lake Tianmuhu

Abstract = {{Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important optically
   active substance that transports nutrients, heavy metals, and other
   pollutants from terrestrial to aquatic systems and is used as a measure
   of water quality. To investigate how the source and composition of CDOM
   changes in both space and time, we used chemical, spectroscopic, and
   fluorescence analyses to characterize CDOM in Lake Tianmuhu (a drinking
   water source) and its catchment in China. Parallel factor analysis
   (PARAFAC) identified three individual fluorophore moieties that were
   attributed to humic-like and protein-like materials in 224 water samples
   collected between December 2008 and September 2009. The upstream rivers
   contained significantly higher concentrations of CDOM than did the lake
   water (a(350) of 4.27 +/- 2.51 and 2.32 +/- 0.59 m(-1), respectively),
   indicating that the rivers carried a substantial load of organic matter
   to the lake. Of the three main rivers that flow into Lake Tianmuhu, the
   Pingqiao River brought in the most CDOM from the catchment to the lake.
   CDOM absorption and the microbial and terrestrial humic-like components,
   but not the protein-like component, were significantly higher in the wet
   season than in other seasons, indicating that the frequency of rainfall
   and runoff could significantly impact the quantity and quality of CDOM
   collected from the catchment. The different relationships between the
   maximum fluorescence intensities of the three PARAFAC components, CDOM
   absorption, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration in riverine
   and lake water indicated the difference in the composition of CDOM
   between Lake Tianmuhu and the rivers that feed it. This study
   demonstrates the utility of combining excitation-emission matrix
   fluorescence and PARAFAC to study CDOM dynamics in inland waters. (C)

Title = {{Natural diet and grazing rate of the temperate sponge Dysidea avara

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{176}},
Pages = {{179-190}},
Abstract = {{Sponges are one of the major invertebrate groups inhabiting hard-bottom
   communities worldwide. In this study, we measured in situ rates of
   grazing on DOC (dissolved organic carbon), POC (particulate organic
   carbon), and pico-, nano- and microplankton for the common temperate
   sponge Dysidea avara throughout a yearly cycle. The natural diet of the
   species was highly heterogeneous and included procaryotes (heterotrophic
   bacteria, Prochlorococcus sp., Synechococcus sp.) and eucaryotes
   (protozoa, phytoplankton, and ciliates) ranging in size from 0.5 +/- 0.3
   (heterotrophic bacteria) to 70 +/- 0.3 pm (pennate diatoms). Procaryotic
   cell clearance rates were higher than those for the other groups,
   suggesting a higher grazing efficiency upon these prey types. Specific
   clearance rates showed a pattern of decrease with sponge size increase,
   although they did not vary with prey concentration or with temperature.
   Overall, procaryotes contributed 74 +/- 14 \% of the total ingested
   carbon, pico- and nanoeucaryotes contributed 11 +/- 3\%, and
   phytoplankton contributed 11 +/- 10\%. Therefore, Dysidea avara obtained
   85\% of its ingested carbon from the fraction smaller than 5 mu m and
   15\% from the fraction larger than 5 mu m. However, the partial
   contributions of the different groups varied seasonally, following the
   planktonic composition of the water column. During winter, phytoplankton
   was an important component of the total uptake (26 \%), whereas during
   the rest of the year it contributed less than 7 \% of the total uptake.
   The capacity of this sponge to feed on a broad size range of prey
   allowed it to maintain rather constant food uptake throughout the year.
   These results show the importance of particle type (size) for selective
   uptake in sponges, as well as the relevance of phytoplankton in the
   sponge diet. This trophic plasticity may represent an advantage for the
   species because it attenuates the effects of seasonal fluctuations in
   the planktonic community. This plasticity in trophic ecology may be one
   of the main factors contributing to the worldwide abundance and
   distribution of sponges despite large spatial and temporal variations in
   food sources.}},

Abstract = {{Much of what we know about the cycling of terrigenous organic matter (
   OM) in freshwater and marine systems can be attributed to evidence
   derived from biomarkers such as lignin. Here we report the fractionation
   of lignin phenols both during solubilization from plant litters and
   again during sorption of resulting leachates to soils. Source parameters
   in both leached and sorbed lignin varied from the parent litters by as
   much as ten-fold, while elevated lignin oxidation parameters in riverine
   dissolved OM ( DOM) can be completely explained by dissolution and
   sorption. Carbon-normalized dissolved lignin endmembers indicate a
   substantial fraction of riverine DOM may not be vascular plant-derived,
   and thus derived from algal, microbial or non-vascular plant sources
   such as mosses. These results demonstrate that riverine DOM is less
   degraded and likely more labile than previously thought, and helps
   resolve the paradox of diagenetically-altered riverine DOM degrading
   rapidly in marine systems.}},

Abstract = {{Unsaturated fatty acids rapidly photodecomposed in filtered seawater to
   aliphatic aldehydes and an omega-oxocarboxylic acid (CHO-(CH2)(n)-COOH)
   upon a 5-h exposure to ambient sunlight. The photoreactivity of fatty
   acids increased as their degree of unsaturation increased. Palmitic acid
   displayed no photodegradation while monounsaturated oleic acid
   photodecomposed to nonanal and 9-oxononanoic, respectively.
   Photooxidation of the polyunsaturated linoleic acid produced
   significantly higher concentrations, primarily hexanal, and a wider
   variety of aldehydes. The rate of photodegradation was more than 10
   times greater for the polyunsaturated fatty acids than for the
   monounsaturated fatty acids. Photolysis of the triglyceride,
   trilinolein, gave an aldehyde profile similar to its component fatty
   acid, indicating each undergoes a similar mechanism of photodegradation.
   Twenty percent of the initial triglyceride was photodegraded during the
   6-h irradiation. The rapid photoreactivity of unsaturated fatty acids
   may explain their low in situ levels relative to saturated fatty acids,
   the latter of which are found in the dissolved phase at relatively
   higher levels.
   Fluorescent hydrophobic dissolved organic matter, operationally defined
   as humic substances, increased after irradiation of trilinolein-treated
   seawater over a 14-d period. The concentration of humic products was
   enhanced by postphotolysis addition of ammonia. Dissolved ammonia
   concentrations declined as the dissolved organic nitrogen of the
   extracted humics increased, indicating the added ammonia was becoming
   incorporated into the organic structure.}},

Title = {{Photo-lability of deep ocean dissolved black carbon}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1661-1670}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved black carbon (DBC), defined here as condensed aromatics
   isolated from seawater via PPL solid phase extraction and quantified as
   benzenepolycarboxylic acid (BPCA) oxidation products, is a significant
   component of the oceanic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. These
   condensed aromatics are widely distributed in the open ocean and appear
   to be tens of thousands of years old. As such DBC is regarded as highly
   refractory. In the current study, the photo-lability of DBC, DOC and
   coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM; ultraviolet-visible absorbance)
   were determined over the course of a 28 day irradiation of North
   Atlantic Deep Water under a solar simulator. During the irradiation DBC
   fell from 1044 +/- 164 nM-C to 55 +/- 15 nM-C, a 20-fold decrease in
   concentration. Dissolved black carbon photo-degradation was more rapid
   and more extensive than for bulk CDOM and DOC. The concentration of DBC
   correlated with CDOM absorbance and the quality of DBC indicated by the
   ratios of different BPCAs correlated with CDOM absorbance spectral
   slope, suggesting the optical properties of CDOM may provide a proxy for
   both DBC concentrations and quality in natural waters. Further, the
   photo-lability of components of the DBC pool increased with their degree
   of aromatic condensation. These trends indicate that a continuum of
   compounds of varying photo-lability exists within the marine DOC pool.
   In this continuum, photo-lability scales with aromatic character,
   specifically the degree of condensation. Scaling the rapid
   photo-degradation of DBC to rates of DOC photo-mineralisation for the
   global ocean leads to an estimated photo-chemical half-life for oceanic
   DBC of less than 800 years. This is more than an order of magnitude
   shorter than the apparent age of DBC in the ocean. Consequently,
   photo-degradation is posited as the primary sink for oceanic DBC and the
   apparent survival of DBC molecules in the oceans for millennia appears
   to be facilitated not by their inherent inertness but by the rate at
   which they are cycled through the surface ocean's photic zone.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial biomarkers (D-amino acids and muramic acid) were measured in
   various organic matter size fractions collected in the North Pacific and
   North Atlantic, and they were used to quantitatively estimate bacterial
   contributions to particulate and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen
   reservoirs. The origins and yields of biomarkers were determined in
   cultured marine bacteria, and the results indicated that D-amino acids
   are derived from numerous macromolecules in addition to peptidoglycan
   and are not solely from peptidoglycan. Bacterial detritus was a major
   component of particulate organic matter (POM) and is an important source
   of submicronsize particles and colloids in the ocean. Peptidoglycan was
   a substantial component of POM but not of dissolved organic matter
   (DOM). Compositional differences between POM and DOM primarily reflected
   the selective incorporation of specific bacterial components into these
   reservoirs. Autotrophic and heterotrophic bacterial sources were not
   quantified separately, but the presence of D-aspartic acid (D-Asx) and
   D-serine (D-Ser) suggested that heterotrophic sources were substantial.
   The average reactivity of bacterial organic matter was comparable to
   that of the bulk organic carbon pool. Bacteria were important sources of
   labile, semilabile, and refractory dissolved organic carbon. Bacterial
   organic matter accounted for similar to 25\% of particulate and
   dissolved organic carbon and similar to 50\% of particulate and
   dissolved organic nitrogen. These results demonstrate the importance of
   bacteria in regulating the ocean carbon and nitrogen cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Heterotrophic bacterial growth and the chemical composition of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) produced by bacteria from freshwater and marine
   environments were monitored during experiments with artificial media
   containing glucose as the sole carbon source. Glucose was quickly
   consumed, and DOM was released during bacterial growth. Percentages of
   extracellular release of DOM from bacteria ranged from 14\% to 31\%,
   indicating that bacterial production and growth efficiency are
   underestimated when only cellular carbon is measured. Relatively high
   concentrations of D-alanine (D-Ala) were observed in DOM released during
   exponential growth, whereas the concentrations of muramic acid and other
   D-amino acid components of peptidoglycan were not detected or were in
   low concentration. The selective release of D-Ala occurred during cell
   growth and division when peptidoglycan is cleaved and newly synthesized
   subunits are incorporated into the cell wall via transpeptidation. Most
   of the D-Ala released during exponential growth was rapidly consumed.
   Following exponential growth, bacterial abundance decreased due to
   grazing and possibly viral lysis. The DOM remaining in the incubations
   after one or more months included a mixture of D-amino acids commonly
   found in peptidoglycan and the amino sugars glucosamine and
   galactosamine, which were highly resistant to decomposition. The
   percentage of D-amino acids was much higher in DOM than in cells due to
   the preferential release of D-amino acids and decomposition of L-amino
   acids. The final concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged
   from 20 to 30 mu mol L-1 regardless of the initial concentration of
   glucose or the source of inoculum. The observed abundances of D-amino
   acids and amino sugars in DOM from diverse aquatic environments indicate
   a bacterial source and common decomposition processes.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective in writing this paper is to frame the issues pertaining to
   the role of natural organic matter in affecting the speciation and
   transport (fate) of trace contaminants, which include hydrophilic trace
   metals and hydrophobic trace organics, within estuaries. In particular,
   we focus on one aspect of the problem: the partitioning of trace
   contaminants between organic and inorganic particles, colloids and
   solution. This paper is developed along three main lines. First, we
   review the literature with respect to trace metal sorption by metal
   oxides in the presence of organic ligands. Second, we examine the role
   of colloidal organic matter in regulating the estuarine behavior of
   trace contaminants. The focus of this portion of the paper is on the
   trapping of trace metals within colloidal and particulate organic matter
   and a re-examination of the `particle concentration effect'. Third, we
   propose a new conceptual model (the `percolator' model) which links
   several processes (sorption, diffusion, coagulation) and which serves as
   a framework for evaluating the trapping of trace metals and organic
   matter within estuarine sediments. One conclusion derived from
   simulations of the diffusive flux of DOC from sediments is that the
   magnitude of sediment/water interfacial shear stress does not affect DOC
   flux until the shear stress is sufficient for the onset of bed erosion.
   The consequence is that interactions between DOC and sediment materials
   become the controlling factors in regulating the diffusive flux of DOC.

Abstract = {{The chemical properties of organic matter affect important soil
   processes such as speciation, solubilization, and transport of plant
   nutrients and metals. This work uses ultrahigh resolution electrospray
   ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry
   to determine the molecular composition of three organic matter fractions
   of soils and aqueous extracts of crop biomass. Comparison of the van
   Krevelen plots allowed tracking the changes in organic matter with
   increasing humification. Aqueous plant biomass extracts contain a
   diverse mixture of lipids, proteins, and lignins. Soil aqueous extracts
   were marked by increases in lignin and carbohydrate components and
   decrease in the protein component as compared to the plant extract
   Refractory humic acid fractions were marked by decrease in the lignin
   component and increases in the lipid and condensed aromatic components.
   The multivariate indicator species analysis was used to identify marker
   components of the four organic matter types investigated. The plant
   extract group had 772 marker components compared to 237 for soil aqueous
   extract, 92 for mobile humic acid, and 418 for calcium humic acid. This
   study demonstrates that ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and
   multivariate methods can be used to identify marker components to gain a
   molecular-scale description and understanding of C dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Bulk nitrogen (N) isotope signatures have long been used to investigate
   organic N source and food web structure in aquatic ine source and
   processing history in non-living marine organic matter. We measured
   delta(15) N-AA distributions in plankton tows, sinking particulate
   organic matter (POM), and ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter (UDOM)
   in the central Pacific Ocean. 815 N-AA patterns in eukaryotic algae and
   mixed plankton tows closely resemble those previously reported in
   culture. 8 15 N differences between individual amino acids (AA) strongly
   suggest that the sharply divergent 815 N enrichment for different AA
   with trophic transfer, as first reported by {[}McClelland, J.W. and
   Montoya, J.P. (2002) Trophic relationships and the nitrogen isotopic
   composition of amino acids. Ecology 83, 2173-2180], is a general
   phenomenon. In addition, differences in 815 N of individual AA
   indicative of trophic transfers are clearly preserved in sinking POM,
   along with additional changes that may indicate subsequent microbial
   reworking after incorporation into particles. We propose two internally
   normalized 615 N proxies that track heterotrophic processes in detrital
   organic matter. Both are based on isotopic signatures in multiple AA,
   chosen to minimize potential problems associated with any single
   compound in degraded materials. A trophic level indicator (ATr) is
   derived from the 815 N difference between selected groups of AA based on
   their relative enrichment with trophic transfer.
   We propose that a corresponding measure of the variance within a
   subgroup of AA (designated F, P) may indicate total AA resynthesis, and
   be strongly tied to heterotrophic microbial reworking in detrital
   materials. Together, we hypothesize that ATr and E V define a two
   dimensional trophic ``space{''}, which may simultaneously express
   relative extent of eukaryotic and bacterial heterotrophic processing.
   In the equatorial Pacific, ATr indicates an average of 1.5-2 trophic
   transfers between phytoplankton and sinking POM at all depths and
   locations. The E V parameter suggests that substantial variation may
   exist in bacterial heterotrophic processing between differing regions
   and time periods. In dissolved material 615 N-AA patterns appear
   unrelated to those in POM. In contrast to POM, 615 N-AA signatures in
   UDOM show no clear changes with depth, and suggest that dissolved AA
   preserved throughout the oceanic water column have undergone few, if
   any, trophic transfers. Together these data suggest a sharp divide
   between processing histories, and possibly sources, of particulate vs.
   dissolved AA. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A consensus is now emerging that the structure of organic macromolecules
   will determine their function in aquatic systems. Transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) is a widely used technique to study the morphology of
   biomolecules that, under the proper conditions, allows for accurate
   determination of the shapes and horizontal dimensions of macromolecules.
   Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a newer technique that has better
   overall resolution, particularly on the vertical scale. Although careful
   controls must be in place for both techniques to avoid the introduction
   of artifacts, they are highly complementary techniques for the study of
   natural colloids and can, when used together, reveal complementary
   information about the relative abundance and structures of aquatic
   macromolecules and colloids. Although AFM techniques have not previously
   been applied to the study of oceanic macromolecules and colloids, TEM
   has been used, albeit often under nonoptimal staining and embedding
   conditions. In this study, colloid samples from the Gulf of Mexico and
   Middle Atlantic Eight of nominal sizes 1-200 nm were collected by
   cross-flow ultrafiltration, diafiltered, and freeze-dried. Rehydrated
   colloids were analyzed in parallel by AFM and TEM using standardized
   techniques. Results from estuarine-, surface-, and deep-water samples
   show that an important fraction of colloidal organic matter (COM)
   consists of fibrillar material, which is rich in polysaccharides and
   ``fresher{''} (i.e., has a younger radiocarbon age) than the bulk COM.
   This result is important because COM makes up 30-70\% of oceanic and
   estuarine nominally ``dissolved{''} organic matter. Other microparticles
   appear to be quasi-spherical, often attached to the fibrils like pearls.
   In the surface waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Middle Atlantic Eight, and
   Trinity River, fibrils with diameters of 1-3 nm and lengths of 100-2,000
   nn were predominant. Although fibrils were also observed in samples from
   the benthic nepheloid layer in the Gulf of Mexico (1,600 m) and Middle
   Atlantic Eight (2,600 m), a much greater heterogeneity of colloid and
   macromolecule shapes and sizes was observed in these deeper waters.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous measurements of seasonal depletions in dissolved inorganic
   carbon (SIGMA-CO2), nitrogen {[}NO3- + NO2-] and phosphate (HPO42- and
   concentrations of C, N and P collected using sediment traps at five
   representative sites in a 25,000 km2 sector of the western Bransfield
   Strait over a 4-month period have allowed us to evaluate the coupling
   between primary production and particle flux.  During the spring bloom
   period (December to January), we observed a substantial removal of
   SIGMA-CO2, {[}NO3- + NO2-] and HPO4(2-) corresponding to a net upper
   water column (0-50 m) seasonal production of 8410 mmol C m-2, 827 mmol N
   m-2 and 53.1 mmol P m-2.  This equates to an average C:N:P ratio of
   158:15.6:1.  These C:N (and C:P) ratios are higher than the expected
   Redfield ratios and also exceed the C:N and C:P ratios directly measured
   for suspended and sinking particles.  We hypothesize a coupled formation
   of carbon-rich dissolved organic matter as a sink for approximately
   30-50\% of the SIGMA-CO2 removed during net photosynthesis.  The rapid
   production and accumulation of phytoplankton in the northern portion of
   Gerlache Strait during the spring bloom resulted in a substantial pCO2
   undersaturation (pCO2 less-than-or-equal-to 100-mu-atm) compared to
   surface samples collected from lower productivity areas in Drake Passage
   (pCO2 greater-than-or-equal-to 325-mu-atm).  Nevertheless, CO2 invasion
   from the atmosphere was minimal, in part due to the fact that there was
   little or no wind-driven mixing at this time of the year.  Particulate
   C, N, P and ATP fluxes derived from free-floating sediment traps,
   revealed a substantial variability in time and space.  The greatest
   seasonal variation occurred at the stations with the highest rates of
   primary production.  For example, both the highest (31.1 mmol C m-2
   day-1) and lowest (< 3.0 mmol C m-2 day-1) rates of POC flux were
   measured in the northern portion of Gerlache Strait; the other sites
   exhibited moderate (4.1-12.5 mmol C m-2 day-1) but more constant fluxes
   during the period of our observations.  Nevertheless, the total
   seasonally integrated C and N fluxes were nearly identical (1.3-1.5 mol
   C m-2 and 0.16 mol N m-2).  For the northern Gerlache Strait station,
   new production was 26\% of total production during the December to
   January spring bloom period.}},

Abstract = {{The optics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the
   Greenland Sea were investigated and compared to results from earlier
   studies in the Southeastern North Sea. Absorption at 375 nm (a(375)) in
   the Greenland Sea varied from 0.77 m(-1) to the detection limit of our
   instrument (0.05 m(-1)), with the highest values found during summer.
   The spectral slope coefficient (S) ranged from 8.2 to 26.4 mum(-1) with
   the highest values occurring during winter. Seasonal variations in the
   in situ production and degradation of CDOM where shown to be responsible
   for the trends seen. A negative correlation between S and a(375) was
   evident in the Greenland Sea and differed noticeably from that found in
   coastal waters. The differing S-a(375) behavior of CDOM known to be of
   terrestrial origin allowed the development of an algorithm for the
   differentiation between marine and terrestrial organic matter. The
   behavior of marine CDOM was modeled by S 7.4 + 1.1/a(375).}},

Abstract = {{A new model for three-dimensional mesoscale flow is used to simulate the
   vertical transport of nutrients into the euphotic zone from deeper
   waters. We use the model to diagnose the effects of mesoscale motions:on
   the upper ocean biogeochemical cycles of NO3, CO2, O-2, sea surface
   exposure tracers that resemble dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and H2O2,
   and the corresponding rates of new production and gas exchange in
   regions near the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) oligotrophic time
   series sites of Hawaii and Bermuda during late summer. The physical
   model is nonhydrostatic and designed to handle open boundaries without
   excessive damping as described by Mahadevan and Archer {[}1998]. It is
   initialized and driven at the open boundaries with flow fields from the
   1/4 degrees global circulation model of Semtner and Chervin {[}1992]. We
   examine, the effect of model resolution and the attending increase in
   mesoscale and frontal-scale motions on the nutrient and carbon chemistry
   of the upper ocean. New production, approximated and diagnosed as an
   exponential uptake of nutrients within the euphotic zone, increases with
   model resolution. Nutrient is supplied for new production where
   isopycnals from the subsurface outcrop at the base of the euphotic zone,
   primarily at fronts. The rate and spatial scale of upwelling and,
   nutrient uptake are more sensitive to model resolution than are
   temperature or the more slowly responding geochemical tracers such as
   CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in groundwater and surface water samples
   from the Florida coastal Everglades were studied using
   excitation-emission matrix fluorescence modeled through parallel factor
   analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). DOM in both surface and groundwater from the
   eastern Everglades S332 basin reflected a terrestrial-derived
   fingerprint through dominantly higher abundances of humic-like PARAFAC
   components. In contrast, surface water DOM from northeastern Florida Bay
   featured a microbial-derived DOM signature based on the higher abundance
   of microbial humic-like and protein-like components consistent with its
   marine source. Surprisingly, groundwater DOM from northeastern Florida
   Bay reflected a terrestrial-derived source except for samples from
   central Florida Bay well, which mirrored a combination of terrestrial
   and marine end-member origin. Furthermore, surface water and groundwater
   displayed effects of different degradation pathways such as
   photodegradation and biodegradation as exemplified by two PARAFAC
   components seemingly indicative of such degradation processes. Finally,
   Principal Component Analysis of the EEM-PARAFAC data was able to
   distinguish and classify most of the samples according to DOM origins
   and degradation processes experienced, except for a small overlap of
   S332 surface water and groundwater, implying rather active
   surface-to-ground water interaction in some sites particularly during
   the rainy season. This study highlights that EEM-PARAFAC could be used
   successfully to trace and differentiate DOM from diverse sources across
   both horizontal and vertical flow profiles, and as such could be a
   convenient and useful tool for the better understanding of hydrological
   interactions and carbon biogeochemical cycling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Recent studies have indicated that biological activity is higher in the
   central Arctic Ocean than once thought. To assess the contribution of
   heterotrophic processes, we examined bacterial production and the uptake
   of specific components of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool during
   a trans-Arctic expedition. Bacterial production generally covaried with
   phytoplankton production and bacterial numbers; the highest Values of
   all three parameters were in the more open waters of the Chukchi Sea and
   they were generally lower at the other stations which were covered by
   ice. Although bacterial production correlated with phytoplankton
   production, the ratio of bacterial to phytoplankton production (BP:PP)
   varied substantially. It was lowest (BP:PP < 0.1) at stations with some
   open water and highest at ice-covered stations, sometimes exceeding
   I,depending on how bacterial production was measured. These high BP:PP
   ratios imply that bacterial respiration and DOM fluxes are large. This
   bacterial activity could be accounted for by the uptake of dissolved
   free amino acids (DFAA) and glucose. Uptake of these DOM components was
   high because of rapid turnover and high concentrations, especially of
   DFAA. Concentrations of dissolved combined neutral carbohydrates (e.g.
   polysaccharides) were often also high compared to other environments.
   These data indicate that heterotrophic bacteria and the rest of the
   microbial loop are large and active components of the biological
   community in the Arctic Ocean in spite of perennially law temperatures.

Abstract = {{Reef building corals are generally believed to require clear,
   nutrient-poor water. Yet, paradoxically, coral reefs are among the most
   productive marine ecosystems in the world. This paradox is commonly
   explained by the coral's ability to utilize a number of food resources,
   including zooplankton, phytoplankton, dissolved organic matter and
   photosynthetic products derived from their endosymbiotic algae, the
   zooxanthellae. Sedimentation is a known stressor for corals, inhibiting
   most feeding modes in various ways. However, evidence for enhanced
   sediment deposition on certain corals, induced by their morphologies, as
   well as for sediment ingestion by some corals, has led us to examine the
   use of sediment as a possible source of food for corals in addition to
   the other, known food sources. Our experiments with fluorescently
   labelled sediment show transfer of labelled organic matter from the
   sediment into the cells of the solitary coral Fungia horrida Dana 1846.
   The results provide the first direct evidence for the ability of a coral
   to digest the sediment's organic fraction. These results may indicate a
   positive role of sediment, which up until now was considered to have
   only deleterious effects on corals.}},

Abstract = {{Seawater incubation experiments were conducted in June and October 1992
   to examine bacterial utilization of labile dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) in open ocean surface waters of the eastern North Pacific. Natural
   plankton extract-DOM (PE-DOM) and selected model compounds were added to
   seawater samples to evaluate bacterial utilization and respiration rates
   relative to bacterial carbon production rates for the various
   amendments. PE-DOM always stimulated bacterial production and DOM
   utilization, and the primary nitrogen source supporting this bacterial
   production was dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Utilization of DON
   during exponential growth was balanced by the production of ammonium for
   samples amended with PE-DOM. Bacterial growth efficiencies for samples
   amended with PE-DOM ranged between 3.4 and 8.8 \% and generally were
   slightly higher in June than in October. Of the model compounds tested,
   net bacterial biomass production was observed only in samples amended
   with glucose, glucose plus ammonium (glucose+NH4+), and dissolved free
   amino acids (DFAA). Bacterial growth efficiencies for these amendments
   were 0.8, 1.9, and and 9.3.\%, respectively. Bacterial production at in
   situ DOM concentrations was observed in June but not in October. Using
   the bacterial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) utilization rates observed
   in this study together with other detailed information pertaining to
   bulk DOC at our study site, we estimate that the turnover time for
   labile DOC in these surface waters ranges from approximately 2 to 6 d
   depending on the labiliity of the standing stock of DOC. On the basis of
   (a) the exclusive use of DON as a nitrogen source in PE-DOM amendments,
   (b) the stimulation of ammonium utilization in the glucose+NH4+
   amendment, and (c) the higher growth efficiencies observed for samples
   amended with either PE-DOM or DFAA, we suggest that bacterioplankton
   biomass production in eastern North Pacific surface waters is primarily
   energy limited. As a result of this energy limitation, bacterial
   production appears to be additionally constrained by the quality of the
   nutrients available for assimilation. Thus, the quality of the DOM
   substrate, specifically the DOC:DON ratio, can be a major determinant of
   bacterial production in pelagic marine systems.}},

Abstract = {{More than 90\% of the global ocean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is
   refractory, has an average age of 4000-6000 years and a lifespan from
   months to millennia. The fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that
   is resistant to degradation is a long-term buffer in the global carbon
   cycle but its chemical composition, structure, and biochemical formation
   and degradation mechanisms are still unresolved. We have compiled the
   most comprehensive molecular dataset of 197 Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analyses from
   solid-phase extracted marine DOM covering two major oceans, the Atlantic
   sector of the Southern Ocean and the East Atlantic Ocean (ranging from
   50 degrees N to 70 degrees S). Molecular trends and radiocarbon dating
   of 34 DOM samples (comprising Delta C-14 values from -229 parts per
   thousand to -495 parts per thousand) were combined to model an
   integrated degradation rate for bulk DOC resulting in a predicted age of
   >24 ka for the most persistent DOM fraction. First order kinetic
   degradation rates for 1557 mass peaks indicate that numerous DOM
   molecules cycle on timescales much longer than the turnover of the bulk
   DOC pool (estimated residence times of up to similar to 100 ka) and the
   range of validity of radiocarbon dating. Changes in elemental
   composition were determined by assigning molecular formulae to the
   detected mass peaks. The combination of residence times with molecular
   information enabled modelling of the average elemental composition of
   the slowest degrading fraction of the DOM pool. In our dataset, a group
   of 361 molecular formulae represented the most stable composition in the
   oceanic environment ({''}island of stability{''}). These most persistent
   compounds encompass only a narrow range of the molecular elemental
   ratios H/C (average of 1.17 +/- 0.13), and O/C (average of 0.52 +/-
   0.10) and molecular masses (360 +/- 28 and 497 +/- 51 Da). In the
   Weddell Sea DOC concentrations in the surface waters were low (46.3 +/-
   3.3 mu M) while the organic radiocarbon was significantly more depleted
   than that of the East Atlantic, representing average surface water DOM
   ages of 4920 +/- 180 a. These results are in accordance with a highly
   degraded DOM in the Weddell Sea surface water as also shown by the
   molecular degradation index IDEG obtained from FT-ICR MS data. Further,
   we identified 339 molecular formulae which probably contribute to an
   increased DOC concentration in the Southern Ocean and potentially
   reflect an accumulation or enhanced sequestration of refractory DOC in
   the Weddell Sea. These results will contribute to a better understanding
   of the persistent nature of marine DOM and its role as an oceanic carbon
   buffer in a changing climate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Effects of Coral Reef Benthic Primary Producers on Dissolved Organic
   Carbon and Microbial Activity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Benthic primary producers in marine ecosystems may significantly alter
   biogeochemical cycling and microbial processes in their surrounding
   environment. To examine these interactions, we studied dissolved organic
   matter release by dominant benthic taxa and subsequent microbial
   remineralization in the lagoonal reefs of Moorea, French Polynesia.
   Rates of photosynthesis, respiration, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   release were assessed for several common benthic reef organisms from the
   backreef habitat. We assessed microbial community response to dissolved
   exudates of each benthic producer by measuring bacterioplankton growth,
   respiration, and DOC drawdown in two-day dark dilution culture
   incubations. Experiments were conducted for six benthic producers: three
   species of macroalgae (each representing a different algal phylum:
   Turbinaria ornata - Ochrophyta; Amansia rhodantha - Rhodophyta; Halimeda
   opuntia - Chlorophyta), a mixed assemblage of turf algae, a species of
   crustose coralline algae (Hydrolithon reinboldii) and a dominant
   hermatypic coral (Porites lobata). Our results show that all five types
   of algae, but not the coral, exuded significant amounts of labile DOC
   into their surrounding environment. In general, primary producers with
   the highest rates of photosynthesis released the most DOC and yielded
   the greatest bacterioplankton growth; turf algae produced nearly twice
   as much DOC per unit surface area than the other benthic producers (14.0
   +/- 2.8 mu mol h(-1) dm(-2)), stimulating rapid bacterioplankton growth
   (0.044 +/- 0.002 log10 cells h(-1)) and concomitant oxygen drawdown
   (0.16 +/- 0.05 mu mol L-1 h(-1) dm(-2)). Our results demonstrate that
   benthic reef algae can release a significant fraction of their
   photosynthetically-fixed carbon as DOC, these release rates vary by
   species, and this DOC is available to and consumed by reef associated
   microbes. These data provide compelling evidence that benthic primary
   producers differentially influence reef microbial dynamics and
   biogeochemical parameters (i.e., DOC and oxygen availability, bacterial
   abundance and metabolism) in coral reef communities.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation and mineralization of ibuprofen (IBU) were investigated
   using Ultraviolet (UV) Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) in TiO2
   photocatalysis. Samples of ultrapure water (UP) and a secondary treated
   effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), both spiked
   with IBU, as well as a highly concentrated IBU (230 mg L-1)
   pharmaceutical industry wastewater (PIWW), were tested in the
   TiO2/UV-LED system. Three operating parameters, namely, pH, catalyst
   load and number of LEDs were optimized. The process efficiency was
   evaluated in terms of IBU removal using high performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography
   coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Additionally, the
   mineralization was investigated by determining the dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) content. The chemical structures of transformation products
   were proposed based on the data obtained using liquid chromatography
   with a high resolution mass spectrometer ion trap/time-of-flight
   (LC-MS-IT-TOF). A possible pathway of IBU degradation was accordingly
   suggested. Bioassays were performed using the marine bacterium Vibrio
   fischeri to evaluate the potential acute toxicity of original and
   treated wastewaters. TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis was efficient to
   remove IBU from UP and from PIWW, and less efficient in treating the
   wastewater from the municipal WWTP. The acute toxicity decreased by ca.
   40\% after treatment, regardless of the studied matrix.}},

Abstract = {{New conceptual models that highlight the importance of environmental,
   rather than molecular, controls on soil organic matter affect
   interpretations of organic matter (OM) persistence across terrestrial
   and aquatic boundaries. We propose that changing paradigms in our
   thinking about OM decomposition explain some of the uncertainties
   surrounding the fate of land-derived carbon (C) in marine environments.
   Terrestrial OM, which historically has been thought to be chemically
   recalcitrant to decay in soil and aquatic environments, dominates inputs
   to rivers yet is found in trace amounts in the ocean. We discuss three
   major transformations in our understanding of OM persistence that
   influence interpretations of the fate of aquatic OM: (1) a shift away
   from an emphasis on chemical recalcitrance as a primary predictor of
   turnover; (2) new interpretations of radiocarbon ages, which affect
   predictions of reactivity; and (3) the recognition that most OM leaving
   soils in dissolved form has been microbially processed. The first two
   explain rapid turnover for terrigenous OM in aquatic ecosystems once it
   leaves the soil matrix. The third suggests that the presence of
   terrestrial OM in aquatic ecosystems may be underestimated by the use of
   plant biomarkers. Whether these mechanisms occur in isolation of each
   other or in combination, they provide insight into the missing
   terrestrial C signature in the ocean. Spatially and temporally varying
   transformations of OM along land-water networks require that common
   terrestrial source indicators be interpreted within specific
   environmental contexts. We identify areas of research where
   collaborations between aquatic and terrestrial scientists will enhance
   quantification of C transfer from soils to inland water bodies, the
   ocean, and the atmosphere. Accurate estimates of OM processing are
   essential for improving predictions of the response of vulnerable C
   pools at the interface of soil and water to changes in climate and land
   use.}},

Journal = {{QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{207-230}},

Abstract = {{Observations from the last decade suggest an important role of sea ice
   in the global biogeochemical cycles, promoted by (i) active biological
   and chemical processes within the sea ice; (ii) fluid and gas exchanges
   at the sea ice interface through an often permeable sea ice cover; and
   (iii) tight physical, biological and chemical interactions between the
   sea ice, the ocean and the atmosphere. Photosynthetic micro-organisms in
   sea ice thrive in liquid brine inclusions encased in a pure ice matrix,
   where they find suitable light and nutrient levels. They extend the
   production season, provide a winter and early spring food source, and
   contribute to organic carbon export to depth. Under-ice and ice edge
   phytoplankton blooms occur when ice retreats, favoured by increasing
   light, stratification, and by the release of material into the water
   column. In particular, the release of iron highly concentrated in sea
   ice could have large effects in the iron-limited Southern Ocean. The
   export of inorganic carbon transport by brine sinking below the mixed
   layer, calcium carbonate precipitation in sea ice, as well as active
   ice-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes, could play a central role in
   the marine carbon cycle. Sea ice processes could also significantly
   contribute to the sulphur cycle through the large production by ice
   algae of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), the precursor of sulphate
   aerosols, which as cloud condensation nuclei have a potential cooling
   effect on the planet. Finally, the sea ice zone supports significant
   ocean atmosphere methane (CH4) fluxes, while saline ice surfaces
   activate springtime atmospheric bromine chemistry, setting ground for
   tropospheric ozone depletion events observed near both poles. All these
   mechanisms are generally known, but neither precisely understood nor
   quantified at large scales. As polar regions are rapidly changing,
   understanding the large-scale polar marine biogeochemical processes and
   their future evolution is of high priority. Earth system models should
   in this context prove essential, but they currently represent sea ice as
   biologically and chemically inert. Palaeoclimatic proxies are also
   relevant, in particular the sea ice proxies, inferring past sea ice
   conditions from glacial and marine sediment core records and providing
   analogues for future changes. Being highly constrained by marine
   biogeochemistry, sea ice proxies would not only contribute to but also
   benefit from a better understanding of polar marine biogeochemical
   cycles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We examined concentrations and uptake of dissolved neutral
   monosaccharides (DNMS) in order to determine the contribution of DNMS to
   heterotrophic bacterial production and to the flux of dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) in the equatorial Pacific. DNMS concentrations were greater
   during El Nino-affected months of February-April 1992 than during
   August-October 1992; in contrast, glucose turnover was the
   opposite-turnover was faster in August-October than in February-April.
   The variation in sugar concentrations and turnover probably resulted
   from El Nino-induced changes in primary production; as El Nino waned
   primary production increased, which appeared to stimulate bacterial
   activity, especially glucose turnover, that in turn forced down DNMS
   concentrations. In all months, however, DNMS concentrations were low,
   especially compared with total dissolved organic carbon concentrations
   (<1\%) Glucose was the dominant neutral monosaccharide and alone
   supported 15-47\% of bacterial production. Other monosaccharides
   apparently did not support much bacterial growth; concentrations of
   other sugars were low, as probably was turnover. Respiration of glucose
   (30-50\% of uptake) and mannose (60-90\%) was relatively high,
   suggesting that DNMS supported a large fraction of bacterial respiration
   as well as biomass production. These results point to the importance of
   DNMS and glucose in particular in supporting bacterial growth and in
   contributing to the flux of labile DOM.}},

Abstract = {{Utilization of naturally-occurring dissolved free and combined amino

   cultures of bacteria from 2 shallow marine environments, Santa Rosa
   Sound (SRS), Florida, USA, and Flax Pond (FP), Long Island, New York,
   USA. In addition to control experiments, cultures were enriched with
   various sources of C and N. In the SRS cultures, net C assimilation of
   DCAA, DFAA and D-DNA made up from 42 to 60 \% of net bacterial C
   production. The average, relative incorporation of C from DCAA, DFAA and
   D-DNA was 0.13, 0.77 and 0.10, respectively. The corresponding values of
   N were 0.10, 0.81 and 0.09. Addition of NH4+, DFAA, or both, increased
   the incorporation of DCAA, DFAA and D-DNA. Incorporation of N from DCAA,
   DFAA and D-DNA equaled 111 to 219 \% of the bacterial N production.
   Including incorporation of NH4+ and release of NO3-, calculated net
   bacterial N incorporation made up 48 and 290 \% of bacterial N
   production. In the FP experiment, net assimilation of DCAA, DFAA and
   D-DNA equaled 66 to 91 \% (average 77 \%) of net bacterial C production.
   Largely all C incorporation was due to assimilation of DFAA. Enrichment
   of the cultures with NH4+, glucose, methylamines, and
   high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter all increased bacterial
   production. Net N incorporation of DCAA, DFAA and D-DNA corresponded to
   between 100 and 180 \% of net bacterial N production. In 3 cultures DFAA
   were the dominant (> 50 \%) bacterial N source. In the other cultures,
   DFAA and NH4+ were similar in importance as an N source, and together
   they accounted for 80 to 99 \% of bacterial N incorporation. Including
   uptake of NH4+ and uptake or release of NO3- in the N budgets, bacterial
   N incorporation equaled 155 to 413 \% of bacterial N production. The
   reason for this apparently excessive N uptake in both sets of cultures
   may be the release of organic nitrogen compounds.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of ultraviolet radiation on the bioavailability of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) to marine bacterioplankton was investigated in the
   Mediterranean Sea (Strait of Gibraltar, South and North Aegean Sea) and
   in the Caribbean Sea off Curacao. Surface-water samples (collected
   between 1 and 85 m in depth) exposed to solar radiation did not show a
   distinct pattern in subsequent bacterial growth. However, samples
   collected from a pronounced chlorophyll maximum (two stations in the
   Strait of Gibraltar and four stations in the Aegean Sea) displayed in a
   50\% lower bacterial activity in the radiation-exposed treatments
   compared with the dark controls. In contrast, mesopelagic water samples
   (200-350 m in depth) exposed to surface solar radiation exhibited a two-
   to fourfold increase in bacterial activity compared with the
   corresponding dark controls. Addition of the model protein bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) to mesopelagic-water samples and subsequent exposure to
   solar radiation resulted in a 50\% lower rate of bacterial activity
   compared with the dark treatments, thus indicating the occurrence of
   photochemically induced changes to this labile compound. This decrease
   in bacterial activity in BSA-amended, irradiated water was also
   detectable in surface waters sampled off Curacao, whereas BSA amendment
   to surface water from the Mediterranean Sea did not result in a distinct
   pattern of bacterial activity.
   Our data indicate that exposure of DOM to solar radiation causes a
   reduced bioavailability of the exposed DOM to bacterioplankton, if the
   bacterial activity:dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration ratio is
   high (indicative of labile DOM). If the bacterial activity:DOC ratio is
   low (indicative of more refractory DOM), the bioavailability of the DOM
   is increased upon exposure to solar radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Effluent dissolved organic matter (EfOM) collected from the

   natural organic matter collected from the Suwannee River (SRNOM),
   Florida using ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier
   transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS).
   Furthermore, the two different treatment processes at OCSD, activated
   sludge and trickling filter, were separately investigated. The blend of
   these two effluents was further evaluated after it had passed through
   the microfiltration process of the Advanced Water Purification Facility
   (AWPF) at Orange County Water District (OCWD). EfOM contained 872
   different m/z peaks that were unambiguously assigned to exact molecular
   formulae containing a single sulfur atom and carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
   atoms (CHOS formulae). In contrast, the SRNOM sample only contained 152
   CHOS formulae. The trend in CHO molecular compositions was opposite with
   2500 CHO formulae assigned for SRNOM but only about 1000 for EfOM. The
   CHOS-derived mass peaks with highest abundances in EfOM could be
   attributed to surfactants such as linear alkyl benzene sulfonates (LAS),
   their co-products dialkyl tetralin sulfonates (DATS) and their
   biodegraded metabolites such as sulfophenyl carboxylic acids (SPC). The
   differences between the treatments were found minor with greater
   differences between sampling dates than treatment methods used. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Dialkyl phthalate esters (DPEs) are widely used industrial chemicals
   with octanol-seawater partition coefficients ranging between 10(1.80)
   for dimethyl phthalate to 10(10.0) for diisodecyl phthalate, indicating
   a propensity to sorb strongly to particulate matter in aquatic
   environments. Sorption plays a key role in controlling the long-term
   fate of DPEs in aquatic systems and exposure to organisms in aquatic
   food-webs. However, field observations of the sorption of many
   commercial DPEs do not exist. To characterize the sorptive nature of
   DPEs in a real-world aquatic ecosystem, we measured concentrations of
   DPEs congeners, commercial DPE mixtures, and 10 polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) in water, suspended sediments, and bottom sediments of
   a marine inlet. Sorption coefficients of spiked and native DPEs and PCBs
   between suspended sediments and water indicate that the apparent
   sorptive nature of DPEs and PCBs is substantially greater than expected
   from K-OW-based sorption models. Particulate and dissolved organic
   matter showed similar (i.e., not statistically different) sorption
   affinities for native analytes. The apparent fraction of the total
   aqueous concentration of DPEs that is freely dissolved and absorbable
   via the respiratory tract of aquatic organisms varied from virtually
   100\% for DMP to 0.0003\% for C10. The observed decline in concentration
   of most DPEs between suspended and bottom sediments, compared to an
   increase in the concentration of high K-OW PCBs, suggests that the rate
   of desorption and degradation of DPEs exceeds that of organic carbon
   mineralization and contributes to the previously observed lack of
   biomagnification of DPEs in the aquatic food-web of this system.}},

Abstract = {{Time series of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) light
   absorption coefficients indicate a local origin for a large fraction of
   the CDOM in the upper water column of the Sargasso Sea. In the present
   study, we demonstrate that CDOM is produced in bacterial culture
   experiments using Sargasso Sea water and naturally occurring microbial
   assemblages. Seawater cultures were prepared and grown at in situ
   temperatures in the dark for periods of weeks. Selected cultures were
   treated with amendments including inorganic nutrients, glucose,
   phytoplankton exudates, and zooplankton excretia. In all experiments,
   when bacterial biomass increased, CDOM increased during the first week
   of the experiment, followed by a decrease over a longer period of time.
   Cultures amended with both glucose and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus
   produced more CDOM than controls or cultures amended with glucose or
   inorganic nutrients alone. However, when complex DOM substrates (derived
   from phytoplankton or zooplankton cultures) were added to seawater
   cultures, there was a net accumulation of CDOM over the course of the
   experiments. These data suggest that, in addition to microbial growth,
   the quality of the substrate plays an important role in net CDOM
   production. `New' CDOM produced in culture was spectroscopically similar
   to CDOM appearing below the surface during summer stratification. The
   results of the present study support a new paradigm for CDOM in the open
   ocean, which allows for local origin and significant dynamics.
   Appreciation of CDOM dynamics will, in turn, add to our understanding of
   microbial productivity, photochemical rate processes, and ultraviolet
   radiation availability in the global ocean. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and temperature on
   bacterial production was examined in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.
   Addition of glucose, glucose plus ammonium, or free amino acids
   stimulated bacterial production ({[}H-3]thymidine incorporation),
   whereas changes in bacterial abundance were either negligible or much
   less than changes in bacterial production. The average bacterial growth
   rate also greatly increased following DOM additions, whereas in
   contrast, addition of ammonium alone never affected production,
   bacterial abundance, or growth rates. Since the large glucose effect was
   not observed in previous studies of cold oceanic waters, several
   experiments were conducted to examine DOM-temperature interactions.
   These experiments suggest that bacteria respond more quickly and to a
   greater extent to DOM additions at higher temperatures, which may
   explain apparently conflicting results from previous studies. We also
   examined how temperate affects the kinetic parameters of sugar uptake.
   Maximum uptake rates (V-max) of glucose and mannose increased with
   temperature (Q(10) = 2.4), although the half-saturation constant (K-m)
   was unaffected; K-m + S was roughly equal to glucose concentrations (S)
   measured by a high pressure liquid chromographic technique. Bacterial
   production and growth rates appear to be limited by DOM in the
   equatorial Pacific, and thus bacterial production follows primary
   production over large spatial and temporal scales in this oceanic
   regime, as has been observed in other aquatic systems. Although
   temperature may not limit bacterial growth rates in the equatorial
   Pacific and similar warm waters, it could still affect how bacteria
   respond to changes in DOM supply and help set steady-state DOM
   concentrations.}},

Title = {{Molecular Fractionation of Dissolved Organic Matter with Metal Salts}},

Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{4419-4426}},
Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{Coagulation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by hydrolyzing metals is
   an important environmental process with particular relevance, e.g., for
   the cycling of organic matter in metal-rich aquatic systems or the
   flocculation of organic matter in wastewater treatment plants. Often, a
   nonremovable fraction of DOM remains in solution even at low DOM/metal
   ratios. Because coagulation by metals results from interactions with
   functional groups, we hypothesize that noncoagulating fractions have a
   distinct molecular composition. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed
   peat-derived dissolved organic matter remaining in solution after mixing
   with salts of Ca, Al, and Fe using 15 T Electrospray Ionization
   Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry
   (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). Addition of metals resulted in a net removal of DOM.
   Also a reduction of molecular diversity was observed, as the number of
   peaks from the ESI-FT-ICR-MS spectra decreased. At DOM/metal ratios of
   similar to 9 Ca did not show any preference for distinct molecular
   fractions, while Fe and Al removed preferentially the most oxidized
   compounds (O/C ratio >0.4) of the peat leachate. Lowering DOM/metal
   ratios to similar to 1 resulted in further removal of less oxidized as
   well as more aromatic compounds ({''}black carbon{''}). Molecular
   composition in the residual solution after coagulation was more
   saturated, less polar, and less oxidized compared to the original peat
   leachate and exhibited a surprising similarity with DOM of marine
   origin. By identifying more than 9200 molecular formulas we can show
   that structural properties (saturation and aromaticity) and oxygen
   content of individual DOM molecules play an important role in
   coagulation with metals. We conclude that polyvalent cations not only
   alter the net mobility but also the very molecular composition of DOM in
   aquatic environments.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1935-1955}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was extracted by solid-phase extraction
   (SPE) from 137 water samples from different climate zones and different
   depths along an eastern Atlantic Ocean transect. The extracts were
   analyzed with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
   spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI). Delta C-14
   analyses were performed on subsamples of the SPE-DOM. In addition, the
   amount of dissolved organic carbon was determined for all water and
   SPE-DOM samples as well as the yield of amino sugars for selected
   samples. Linear correlations were observed between the magnitudes of
   43\% of the FT-ICR mass peaks and the extract Delta C-14 values.
   Decreasing SPE-DOM Delta C-14 values went along with a shift in the
   molecular composition to higher average masses (m/z) and lower
   hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratios. The correlation was used to model the
   SPE-DOM Delta C-14 distribution for all 137 samples. Based on single
   mass peaks, a degradation index (I-DEG) was developed to compare the
   degradation state of marine SPE-DOM samples analyzed with FT-ICR MS. A
   correlation between Delta C-14, IDEG, DOC values and amino sugar yield
   supports that SPE-DOM analyzed with FT-ICR MS reflects trends of bulk
   DOM. DOM weighted normalized mass peak magnitudes were used to compare
   aged and recent SPE-DOM on a semi-quantitative molecular basis. The
   magnitude comparison showed a continuum of different degradation rates
   for the detected compounds. A high proportion of the compounds should
   persist, possibly modified by partial degradation, in the course of
   thermohaline circulation. Prokaryotic (bacterial) production,
   transformation and accumulation of this very stable DOM occur primarily
   in the upper ocean. This DOM is an important contribution to very old
   DOM, showing that production and degradation are dynamic processes.}},

Abstract = {{Photochemical and microbial decomposition of chromophoric dissolved
   organic matter (CDOM) was studied at time scales in which terrestrially
   derived CDOM is transported from many fresh water watersheds to coastal
   waters. During 70-day exposure, solar radiation decomposed 96\% of
   freshwater CDOM but only 41\% of DOC. Apparent quantum yields for
   photochemical decomposition decreased in proportion to the dose of
   absorbed photons by CDOM. When apparent quantum yield for photochemical
   decomposition of CDOM was applied to an optical model, it revealed that
   solar UV radiation was responsible for 75\% and 44\% of the
   decomposition of CDOM at the surface and in the whole water column,
   respectively. The modeled rates of photochemical decomposition were in
   good agreement with the measurements in a 2-m deep photolytic stratum.
   The photochemical decomposition of CDOM attenuated in the water column
   similarly to violet-blue irradiance. During 500-day long incubations in
   darkness, plankton decomposed CDOM as much as was decomposed at the
   surface by solar radiation in a week. Thus, solar radiation was much
   more important than plankton in the decomposition of CDOM at the
   surface. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of nutrient utilization and primary productivity (PP) in late
   austral spring and early summer in the southwestern Ross Sea were
   characterized with respect to phytoplankton taxonomic composition,
   polynya dynamics, and upper ocean hydrography during the 1996-1997
   oceanographic program Research on Ocean-Atmosphere Variability and
   Ecosystem Response in the Ross Sea. Phytoplankton biomass in the upper
   150 m of the water column ranged from 40 to 540 mg chlorophyll a (Chl a)
   m(-2), exceeding 200 mg Chl a m-2 everywhere except the extreme northern
   and eastern boundaries of the Ross Sea polynya. Diatom biomass was
   greatest in the shallow mixed layers of Terra Nova Bay, while the more
   deeply mixed waters of the Ross Sea polynya were dominated by
   Phaeocytstis antarctica. Daily production computed from the
   disappearance of NO3 (1.14 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and total dissolved
   inorganic carbon (TDIC, 1.29 g C m(-2) d(-1)) is consistent with
   estimates made from an algorithm forced with satellite measurements of
   Chl a (1.25 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and from measurements of C-14 uptake (1.33
   g C m(-2) d(-1)). Phytoplankton PP in the Ross Sea averaged 100 g C
   m(-2) yr(-1) during 1996-1997. Despite the early formation of the Terra
   Nova Bay polynya the diatom bloom there did not reach its peak PP until
   middle to late January 1997 (most likely because of more intense wind
   mixing in November), similar to 6 weeks after the P. antarctica bloom in
   the Ross Sea polynya had reached the same stage of development. From 70
   to 100\% of the C and N deficits in the upper 150 m could be accounted
   for by particulate organic matter, indicating that there had been little
   dissolved organic matter production or export of particulate material
   prior to our cruise. This suggests that early in the season, PP and
   zooplankton grazing are decoupled in the southwestern Ross Sea. The
   NO3:PO4 disappearance ratio in waters dominated by P. antarctica (19.0
   +/- 0.61) was significantly greater than in waters where diatoms were
   most common (9.52 +/- 0.33), and both were significantly different from
   the Redfield N:P ratio of 16. Vertical profiles of TDIC suggest that P.
   antarctica took up 110\% more CO2 per mole of PO4 removed than did
   diatoms, an important consideration for climate models that estimate C
   uptake from the removal of PO4.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 5.25 trillion plastic pieces are floating at the sea
   surface. The impact of plastic pollution on the lowest trophic levels of
   the food web, however, remains unknown. Here we show that plastics
   release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ambient seawater
   stimulating the activity of heterotrophic microbes. Our estimates
   indicate that globally up to 23,600 metric tons of DOC are leaching from
   marine plastics annually. About 60\% of it is available to microbial
   utilization in less than 5 days. If exposed to solar radiation, however,
   this DOC becomes less labile. Thus, plastic pollution of marine surface
   waters likely alters the composition and activity of the base of the
   marine food webs. It is predicted that plastic waste entering the ocean
   will increase by a factor of ten within the next decade, resulting in an
   increase in plastic-derived DOC that might have unaccounted consequences
   for marine microbes and for the ocean system.}},

Abstract = {{As high latitudes warm, a portion of the large organic carbon pool
   stored in permafrost will become available for transport to aquatic
   ecosystems as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). If permafrost DOC is
   biodegradable, much will be mineralized to the atmosphere in freshwater
   systems before reaching the ocean, accelerating carbon transfer from
   permafrost to the atmosphere, whereas if recalcitrant, it will reach
   marine ecosystems where it may persist over long time periods. We
   measured biodegradable DOC (BDOC) in water flowing from collapsing
   permafrost (thermokarst) on the North Slope of Alaska and tested the
   role of DOC chemical composition and nutrient concentration in
   determining biodegradability. DOC from collapsing permafrost was some of
   the most biodegradable reported in natural systems. However, elevated
   BDOC only persisted during active permafrost degradation, with a return
   to predisturbance levels once thermokarst features stabilized.
   Biodegradability was correlated with background nutrient concentration,
   but nutrient addition did not increase overall BDOC, suggesting that
   chemical composition may be a more important control on DOC processing.
   Despite its high biodegradability, permafrost DOC showed evidence of
   substantial previous microbial processing, and we present four
   hypotheses explaining this incongruity. Because thermokarst features
   form preferentially on river banks and lake shores and can remain active
   for decades, thermokarst may be the dominant short-term mechanism
   delivering sediment, nutrients, and biodegradable organic matter to
   aquatic systems as the Arctic warms.}},

Abstract = {{The biological turnover of riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   discharged into five southeastern United States estuaries was examined
   in long-term respiration bioassays. Measures of bacterial oxygen
   consumption indicated surprisingly large differences in the inherent
   biodegradability of DOC among the five estuaries, despite their close
   geographic proximity. Differences of up to 13-fold in biodegradation
   rates were also found temporally within a single estuary. For most of
   the southeastern United States estuaries, measured rates of riverine DOC
   biodegradation were low relative to rates reported for other freshwater
   and marine environments. This was particularly true for the coastal
   plain ({''}blackwater{''}) rivers that contribute about 35\% of the
   riverine DOC exported to coastal marine environments in this region;
   extrapolation of biodegradation rates to the adjacent continental shelf
   predict biodegradation of a maximum of 11\% of exported blackwater DOC
   within the estuary-shelf system (with transit times of up to 140 d). DOC
   from Piedmont rivers was more biologically labile, with maximum losses
   of 30\% predicted within the estuary and adjacent shelf. Short exposures
   to natural sunlight increased the lability of the riverine DOC and
   enhanced biodegradation rates by over 3-fold in some cases, although
   significant inter-estuary differences in susceptibility of riverine DOC
   to photolysis were also evident.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1998}},

Pages = {{107-124}},
Abstract = {{Primary producers must respond to the diel changes in light
   availability. Therefore, detection of diel cycles in bacterial activity
   would imply tight coupling between the production of photosynthetic
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its consumption by bacteria. Absence
   of diel cycles, on the contrary, would indicate that bacteria depend
   largely upon allochthonous organic carbon and that bacteria are not
   tightly dependent on photosynthetically produced autochthonous carbon.
   In 1993 and 1994 we sampled 3 sites in the NW Mediterranean Sea several
   times a day, and measured several microbial parameters as well as the
   vertical profiles of DOC along the diel cycle. The sites were selected
   so that one was on the continental shelf and, thus, was more influenced
   by coastal runoff; a second one was over the shelf slope and a third,
   oceanic one was located further offshore over a depth of 2000 m. We
   found clear diel cycles in bacterial total and specific activity always
   in the oceanic stations and sometimes in the shelf slope stations. Diel
   changes were detected as changes in both DNA and protein synthesis
   rates. These diel cycles were accompanied by diel changes in the
   distribution of total DOG, and by diel changes in the proportion of
   bacteria containing visible nucleoids. Noon estimates of bacterial
   activity were more than twice the daily average in the oceanic site, but
   they were less different in the other 2 sites. DOC changed daily by 15
   mu M (5 to 15 \% of the total stock). For bacterial activity to explain
   the diel changes in DOC concentration, bacteria should have growth
   efficiencies lower than 10\% in general, and lower than 2\% in the
   oceanic station.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an extensive vertical and longitudinal description
   of the biogeochemistry along an East-West transect of 3000 km across the
   Mediterranean Sea during summer 2008 (BOUM cruise). During this period
   of strong stratification, the distribution of nutrients, particulate and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP) were
   examined to produce a detailed spatial and vertically extended
   description of the elemental stoichiometry of the Mediterranean Sea.
   Surface waters were depleted in nutrients and the thickness of this
   depleted layer increased towards the East from about 10 m in the Gulf of
   Lion to more than 100 m in the Levantine basin, with the phosphacline
   deepening to a greater extent than that for corresponding nitracline and
   thermocline depths. We used the minimum oxygen concentration through the
   water column in combination with 2 fixed concentrations of dissolved
   oxygen to distinguish an intermediate layer (Mineralization Layer; ML)
   from surface (Biogenic Layer; BL), and deep layers (DL). Whilst each
   layer was represented by different water masses, this approach allowed
   us to propose a schematic box-plot representation of the biogeochemical
   functioning of the two Mediterranean basins. Despite the increasing
   oligotrophic nature and the degree of P-depletion along the West to East
   gradient strong similarities were encountered between eastern and
   western ecosystems. Within the BL, the C:N:P ratios in all pools largely
   exceeded the Redfield ratios, but surprisingly, the nitrate vs.
   phosphate ratios in the ML and DL tended towards the canonical Redfield
   values in both basins. A change in particulate matter composition has
   been identified by a C increase relative to N and P along the whole
   water column in the western basin and between BL and ML in the eastern
   one. Our data showed a noticeable stability of the DOC: DON ratio
   (12-13) throughout the Mediterranean Sea. This is in good agreement with
   a P-limitation of microbial activities but in contradiction of the
   accepted concept that N is recycled faster than C. The western and
   eastern basins had similar or close biological functioning. Differences
   come from variability in the allochtonous nutrient sources in terms of
   quantity and quality, and to the specific hydrodynamic features of the
   Mediterranean basins.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregation of algae, mainly of diatoms, is an important process in
   marine pelagic systems, often terminating phytoplankton blooms and
   leading to the sinking of particulate organic matter in the form of
   marine snow. This process has been studied extensively, but the specific
   role of heterotrophic bacteria has largely been neglected, mainly
   because field studies and most experimental work were performed under
   non-axenic conditions. We tested the hypothesis that algae-bacteria
   interactions are instrumental in aggregate dynamics and organic matter
   flux. A series of aggregation experiments has been carried out in
   rolling tanks with two marine diatoms typical of temperate regions
   (Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira rotula) in an axenic treatment
   and one inoculated with marine bacteria. Exponentially growing S.
   costatum and T rotula exhibited distinctly different aggregation
   behavior. This was reflected by their strikingly different release of
   dissolved organic matter (DOM), transparent exopolymer particles (TEP)
   and protein-containing particles (CSP), as well as their bacterial
   biodegradability and recalcitrance. Cells of S. costatum aggregated only
   little and their bacterial colonization remained low. Dissolved organic
   matter, TEP and CSP released by this alga were largely consumed by
   free-living bacteria. In contrast, T rotula aggregated rapidly and DOM,
   TEP and CSP released resisted bacterial consumption. Experiments
   conducted with T rotula cultures in the stationary growth phase,
   however, showed rapid bacterial colonization and decomposition of algal
   cells. Our study highlights the importance of heterotrophic bacteria to
   control the development and aggregation of phytoplankton in marine
   systems.}},

Title = {{Beneficial and detrimental effects of UV on aquatic organisms:
   Implications of spectral variation}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1843-1857}},

Abstract = {{Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may have beneficial as well as
   detrimental effects on living systems. For example, UV-B radiation
   (280-320 nm) is generally damaging, while UV-A radiation (320-400 nm)
   may cause damage or stimulate beneficial photorepair of UV-B damage. The
   nature of both direct and indirect effects of UVR in nature depends on
   both the photon flux density and the spectral composition of the
   radiation incident on aquatic organisms across environmental UVR
   gradients in space (depth, transparency, elevation) and time (diel,
   seasonal, interannual). Here we use the common and widespread freshwater
   cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria as a model organism to demonstrate the
   potential importance of these wavelength-specific effects of UVR to the
   ecology of aquatic organisms. UVR-exposure experiments are used to
   manipulate both natural solar and artificial UVR sources to examine the
   beneficial as well as detrimental effects of different wavelengths of
   UVR. Changes in the spectral composition of solar radiation are also
   examined along several natural environmental gradients including diel
   gradients, depth gradients, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   gradients. The implications of variation in the spectral composition of
   UVR for aquatic organisms are discussed.
   The first biological weighting function (BWF) for a freshwater
   cladoceran is presented here. It demonstrates that the shortest UV-B
   wavelengths in sunlight are potentially the most damaging per photon.
   However, due to the greater photon flux density of longer wavelength UVR
   in sunlight, the net potential damage to Daphnia in nature is greatest
   for the longer wavelength UV-B and shorter wavelength UV-A radiation in
   the 305-322 nm range. Overall the contribution of UV-B to the total
   mortality response of Daphnia exposed to full-spectrum solar radiation
   for 7 h on a sunny summer day is 64\% while UV-A contributes 36\%. The
   BWF for Daphnia is used with the transmission spectrum for Mylar D to
   demonstrate that Mylar D cuts out only about half of the damaging UVR in
   sunlight. Following exposure to damaging UV-B, Daphnia exhibits a
   dramatic increase in survival in the presence of longer wavelength UV-A
   and visible radiation due to the stimulation of photoenzymatic repair.
   We present data that demonstrate the importance of both atmospheric
   ozone and DOC in creating strong environmental gradients in the
   intensity (irradiance) and spectral composition of solar UVR in nature.
   The light-absorbing component of DOC, chromophoric dissolved organic
   matter (CDOM), is particularly important in creating depth refugia from
   damaging UV-B in freshwater ecosystems. CDOM may also cause intense
   variations in the ratio of potentially beneficial UV-A to detrimental
   UV-B radiation to which aquatic organisms are exposed. In addition to
   changes in atmospheric ozone, future changes in CDOM related to climate
   change or other environmental disturbances may substantially alter the
   underwater exposure of a variety of aquatic organisms to different
   wavelengths of solar UVR.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the effects of individual members of the two dominant
   functional groups of the Macoma balthica community on fluxes of
   nutrients and dissolved organic carbon between sediment and overlying
   water. The biodiffusers M balthica and Mya arenaria and the
   gallery-diffuser Nereis virens were added to microcosms containing
   sieved tidal flat sediment, using identical biovolume for each treatment
   to facilitate comparison. Both functional groups enhanced fluxes over a
   control without macrofauna. The gallery-diffuser had the greatest
   effect. The two biodiffusers had opposite effects on the flux of
   nitrate. M balthica, which lives near the sediment surface, caused
   nitrate release whereas M arenaria caused nitrate uptake. Both organisms
   increased the release of ammonia, but M arenaria had the greater effect.
   We attribute this intra-functional difference not so much to different
   functionality as to interactions between organisms and the depth
   distribution of pore water constituents. Because the burrow of M
   balthica is located within the nitrification zone of the sediment, the
   depth averaged concentration of nitrate in its burrow is higher than in
   the overlying water, and burrow flushing leads to net release of
   nitrate. In contrast, the bur-row of M. arenaria includes both
   nitrification and denitrification zones, which lower the depth averaged
   concentration of nitrate below the concentration in the overlying water.
   The functional group approach needs to take the processes that control
   sediment chemistry into account in order to predict fluxes sucessfully.

Abstract = {{Phytoplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotes are major components of the
   microbial food web and interact continuously: heterotrophic prokaryotes
   utilize the dissolved organic carbon derived from phytoplankton
   exudation or cell lysis (DOCp), and mineralization by heterotrophic
   prokaryotes provides inorganic nutrients for phytoplankton. For this
   reason, these communities are expected to be closely linked, although
   the study of the interactions between them is still a major challenge.
   Recent studies have presented interactions between phytoplankton and
   heterotrophic prokaryotes based on coexistence or covariation throughout
   a time-series. However, a real quantification of the carbon flow within
   these networks (defined as the interaction strength, IS) has not been
   achieved yet. This is critical to understand the selectivity degree of
   bacteria responding to specific algal DOCp. Here we used
   microautoradiography to quantify the preferences of the major
   heterotrophic prokaryote phylogenetic groups on DOC derived from several
   representative phytoplankton species, and expressed these preferences as
   an IS value. The distribution of the ISs was not random but rather
   skewed towards weak interactions, in a similar way as the distributions
   described for stable complex non-microbial ecosystems, indicating that
   there are some cases of high specificity on the use of specific algal
   DOCp by some bacterial groups, but weak interactions are more common and
   may be relevant as well. The variety of IS patterns observed supports
   the view that the vast range of different resources (different types of
   organic molecules) available in the sea selects and maintains the high
   levels of diversity described for marine bacterioplankton.}},

Abstract = {{The microbial communities and photosynthetic capacity of cryoconite
   holes on the Midre Lovenbreen Glacier at 79degreesN in Spitzbergen
   (Svalbard Archipelago) were investigated in July/August 2000 and July
   2001. The constituents of the microbial assemblages were more abundant
   in material on the cryoconite: bottoms than in the overlying water.
   Bacterial concentrations ranged from 1.00 to 4.50x10(4) ml(-1) in the
   water and from 4.67 to 7.07x10(4) ml(-1) in the bottom material;
   virus-like particles (VLP) ranged from 3.97 to 12.70x10(4) ml(-1) in the
   water and from 27.5 to 37.59x10(4) ml(-1) on the bottom. VLP: bacteria
   ratios ranged between 0.24 and 8.11, with highest ratios in the bottom
   assemblages. Heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNAN) abundances were
   significantly lower than those of the autotrophic nanoflagellates
   (PNAN). Moreover, HNAN biomass was lower than bacterial biomass,
   indicating that the HNAN were exploiting other energy sources as well as
   bacteria, for example, VLP and dissolved organic carbon. The bottom
   material was dominated by cyanobacteria (mostly Phormidium sp.), while
   both the water and the bottom layer contained a small number of
   chlorophyte species (Chlorella sp., Cylindromonas sp. and Chlamydomonas
   nivalis). Ciliates were very sparse, only occurring on the bottom. On
   occasions, the glacier surface carried meltwater with well-developed
   biofilms, in which ciliates (Monodinium, Strombidium and Halteria)
   occurred. All of these species are found in nearby lakes. One to three
   rotifers were noted in the biofilm samples and in samples from three of
   the cryoconite holes. The assemblages of the cryoconite holes were
   comparable to the truncated food webs seen in Antarctic lakes, but were
   even more simplified and sparse in terms of biomass. Photosynthesis in
   the meltwater on the glacier surface ranged between 0.60 and 8.33 mug C
   l(-1) h(-1). Within the cryoconites, photosynthetic rates were usually
   highest on the bottom (0.63-156.99 mug C l(-1) h(-1)), while in the
   overlying water, rates ranged between 0.34 and 10.56 mug C l(-1) h(-1).
   Given the density of cryoconite holes (circa 6\% of the glacier surface,
   or 12 holes m(-2)), there was significant carbon fixation and nutrient
   cycling occurring on the glacier, associated with cryoconite
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the chemical and optical changes in the dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) from two freshwater lakes and a Sphagnum bog after exposure
   to solar radiation. Stable carbon isotopes and solid-state C-13-NMR
   spectra of DOM were used together with optical and chemical data to
   interpret results from experimental exposures of DOM to sunlight and
   from seasonal observations of two lakes in northeastern Pennsylvania.
   Solar photochemical oxidation of humic-rich bog DOM to smaller LMW
   compounds and to DIC was inferred from losses of UV absorbance, optical
   indices of molecular weight and changes in DOM chemistry.
   Experimentally, we observed a 1.2 parts per thousand enrichment in delta
   C-13 and a 47\% loss in aromatic C functionality in bog DOM samples
   exposed to solar UVR. Similar results were observed in the surface
   waters of both lakes. In late summer hypolimnetic water in humic Lake
   Lacawac, we observed 3 to 4.5 parts per thousand enrichments in delta
   C-13 and a 30\% increase in aromatic C relative to early spring values
   during spring mixing. These changes coincided with increases in
   molecular weight and UV absorbance. Anaerobic conditions of the
   hypolimnion in Lake Lacawac suggest that microbial metabolism may be
   turning over allochthonous C introduced during spring mixing, as well as
   autochthonous C. This metabolic activity produces HMW DOM during the
   summer, which is photochemically labile and isotopically distinct from
   allochthonous DOM or autochthonous DOM. These results suggest both
   photooxidation of allochthonous DOM in the epilimnion and autotrophic
   production of DOM by bacteria in the hypolimnion cause seasonal trends
   in the UV absorbance of lakes.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in elemental and isotopic ratios of suspended particulate
   matter (SPM) were investigated in the Guayas River Estuary Ecosystem
   (GREE) that empties into the Gulf of Guayaquil, Ecuador. Detritus in the
   system was identified on the basis of extremely high carbon:chlorophyll
   a ratios (>1000). This material had mean delta(13)C of -26.4 +/- 0.3,
   delta(15)N of +4.8 +/- 0.2, and (C:N)(atomic) of 14.1 +/- 0.9. The
   isotopic data were comparable to measurements reported for fresh and
   degrading mangrove leaves, whereas the elemental ratio was comparatively
   enriched in nitrogen. Isotope measurements of SPM throughout the GREE
   were more similar to values for riverine material and detritus compared
   with that for the coastal end-member. Values indicative of in situ
   produced algae, sewage and shrimp pond effluent were only found at
   selected sites. Bacterial bioassays, which were used to document
   potential sources of dissolved organic matter in the GREE, were
   isotopically similar to SPM. This correspondence coupled with the
   relatively low (C:N), of SPM could be explained by bacterial
   immobolization of nitrogen onto detritus. Finally, tidal variations of
   (C:N), and delta(13)C at a brackish mangrove site were similar in
   magnitude to spatial variations encountered throughout the GREE. Based
   on these results, the authors caution that care must be taken when
   samples are taken for food-web studies in these systems. (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Jellyfish blooms occur in many estuarine and coastal regions and may be
   increasing in their magnitude and extent worldwide. Voracious jellyfish
   predation impacts food webs by converting large quantities of carbon
   (C), fixed by primary producers and consumed by secondary producers,
   into gelatinous biomass, which restricts C transfer to higher trophic
   levels because jellyfish are not readily consumed by other predators. In
   addition, jellyfish release colloidal and dissolved organic matter
   (jelly-DOM), and could further influence the functioning of coastal
   systems by altering microbial nutrient and DOM pathways, yet the links
   between jellyfish and bacterioplankton metabolism and community
   structure are unknown. Here we report that jellyfish released
   substantial quantities of extremely labile C-rich DOM, relative to
   nitrogen (25.6 +/- 31.6 C:1N), which was quickly metabolized by
   bacterioplankton at uptake rates two to six times that of bulk DOM
   pools. When jelly-DOM was consumed it was shunted toward bacterial
   respiration rather than production, significantly reducing bacterial
   growth efficiencies by 10\% to 15\%. Jelly-DOM also favored the rapid
   growth and dominance of specific bacterial phylogenetic groups
   (primarily gamma-proteobacteria) that were rare in ambient waters,
   implying that jelly-DOM was channeled through a small component of the
   in situ microbial assemblage and thus induced large changes in community
   composition. Our findings suggest major shifts in microbial structure
   and function associated with jellyfish blooms, and a large detour of C
   toward bacterial CO2 production and away from higher trophic levels.
   These results further suggest fundamental transformations in the
   biogeochemical functioning and biological structure of food webs
   associated with jellyfish blooms.}},

   salinity was observed at low tide, due to evaporation effects and

   carbon (POC) showed distinct maxima at periods of highest water flow,
   indicating that erosion of surface sediments and/or resuspension of
   bottom sediments were an important source of particulate material.
   Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), in contrast, varied in phase with water
   height and was highest at low tide. Stable isotope data of POC and DOC
   displayed large variations in both pools, and similarly followed the
   variations in water height. Although the variation of delta C-13(DOC)
   (-23.8 to -13.8 parts per thousand) was higher than that of delta
   C-13(POC) (-26.2 to -20.5 parts per thousand), due to the different
   endmember pool sizes, the delta C-13 signatures of both pools differed
   only slightly at low tide, but up to 9\% at high tide. Thus, at low tide
   both DOC and POC originated from mangrove production. At high tide,
   however, the DOC pool had signatures consistent with a high contribution
   of seagrass-derived material, whereas the POC pool was dominated by
   marine phytoplankton. Daily variations in CH4, and partial pressure of
   CO2 (pCO(2)) were similarly governed by tidal influence and were up to
   7- and 10-fold higher at low tide, which stresses the importance of
   exchange of porewater and diffusive fluxes to the water column. When
   assuming that the high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) levels in the
   upper parts of the creek (i.e. at low tide) are due to inputs from
   mineralization, delta C-13 data on DIC indicate that the organic matter
   source for mineralization had a signature of -22.4 parts per thousand.
   Hence, imported POC and DOC from the marine environment contributes
   strongly to overall mineralization within the mangrove system. Our data
   demonstrate how biogeochemical processes in the intertidal zone appear
   to be prominent drivers of element concentrations and isotope signatures
   in the water column, and how pathways of dissolved and particulate
   matter transport are fundamentally different.}},

Abstract = {{{[} 1] On a sequence of soils developed under similar vegetation,
   temperature, and precipitation conditions, but with variations in
   mineralogical properties, we use organic carbon and 14 C inventories to
   examine mineral protection of soil organic carbon. In these soils, 14 C
   data indicate that the creation of slow-cycling carbon can be modeled as
   occurring through reaction of organic ligands with Al3+ and Fe3+ cations
   in the upper horizons, followed by sorption to amorphous inorganic Al
   compounds at depth. Only one of these processes, the chelation of Al3+
   and Fe3+ by organic ligands, is linked to large carbon stocks. Organic
   ligands stabilized by this process traverse the soil column as dissolved
   organic carbon (both from surface horizons and root exudates). At our
   moist grassland site, this chelation and transport process is very
   strongly correlated with the storage and long-term stabilization of soil
   organic carbon. Our 14 C results show that the mechanisms of organic
   carbon transport and storage at this site follow a classic model
   previously believed to only be significant in a single soil order
   (Spodosols), and closely related to the presence of forests. The
   presence of this process in the grassland Alfisol, Inceptisol, and
   Mollisol soils of this chronosequence suggests that this process is a
   more significant control on organic carbon storage than previously
   thought.}},

Abstract = {{Chromophoric (or colored) dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has been
   identified as a major determinant of the optical properties of
   oligotrophic oceans. The factors controlling distribution of CDOM far
   from the direct influence of land are not well known, as CDOM abundance
   and distribution does not directly correlate with phytoplankton
   productivity or biomass, or with dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   concentration. As part of a larger study of the dynamics of CDOM in the
   open ocean, we investigated direct release from plankton as a factor
   contributing to distribution patterns of CDOM. We measured the
   production of CDOM by zooplankton (copepods, euphausiids, amphipods,
   salps, polychaetes), protozoans (colonial radiolaria), and by the
   colonial cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. in the North Atlantic
   subtropical gyre. Groups of individual species of plankton were
   incubated and absorption spectra were obtained for their release
   products. CDOM was produced by all organisms examined, and absorption
   spectra varied by taxa, with major taxa exhibiting characteristic
   absorption peaks. Plankton-produced DOM is a source of labile carbon and
   thus facilitates microbial activity, and CDOM may also serve as
   photoprotection for near-surface-living organisms. Zooplankton likely
   play an important role in the CDOM cycle in the Sargasso Sea, directly
   through release/excretion of CDOM and indirectly by providing a labile
   substrate (excretia) for microbial-mediated production of CDOM.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular lignin analyses have become a powerful quantitative approach
   for estimating flux and fate of vascular plant organic matter in coastal
   and marine environments. The use of a specific molecular biomarker
   requires detailed knowledge of its decomposition rates relative to the
   associated organic matter and its structural diagenetic changes. To gain
   insight into the poorly known processes of anaerobic lignin diagenesis,
   molecular analyses were performed in the sulfate-reducing sediment of a
   north Brazilian mangrove. Organic matter in samples representing
   different diagenetic stages (i.e., fresh litter, a sediment core, and
   percolating water) was characterized by alkaline CuO oxidation fur
   lignin composition, element (C, N), and stable carbon isotope analyses.
   On the basis of these results and on a balance model. long-term in situ
   decomposition rates of lignin in sulfate-reducing sediments were
   estimated for the first time. The half-life (T-1/2) of lignin derived
   from mangrove leaf litter (mainly Rhizophora mangle) was similar to 150
   yr in the upper 1.5 m of the sediment. Associated organic carbon from
   leaf tissue was depleted to similar to 75\% within weeks, followed by a
   slow mineralization in the sediment (T-1/2 approximate to 300 yr).
   Unlike the known pathways of lignin diagenesis, even highly degraded
   lignin did not show any alterations of the propyl or methoxyl side
   chains, as evident from stable acid to aldehyde ratios and the
   proportion of methoxylated phenols (vanillyl and syringyl phenols).
   Aromatic ring cleavage is probably the principal mechanism for lignin
   decay in the studied environment. Cinnamyl phenols were highly abundant
   in mangrove leaves and were rapidly depleted during early diagenesis.
   Thus, the cinnamyl to vanillyl ratio could be used as a tracer for early
   diagenesis even under the sulfate-reducing conditions. Syringyl phenols
   were removed from dissolved organic matter in interstitial water,
   probably by sorption onto the sediment. Suspended organic matter in a
   mangrove creek showed a different lignin signature than its source,
   namely sedimentary organic matter or mangrove Litter, with clear
   evidence for propyl side chain oxidation. This was probably attributable
   to erosion of aerated thin sediment surface layers during mangrove
   inundation. Although particulate and dissolved organic matter in the
   mangrove creek have a common source, their compositional patterns were
   different, because of different pathways of release, degradation, and
   transport to the creek. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   pattern of high abundance of AAPB and AAPB\% in coastal waters than
   oceanic waters. The Indian Ocean contained relatively high AAPB\%
   compared with the other two oceans, corresponding to the high primary
   production in this region. Both abundance of AAPB and AAPB\% were
   positively correlated with the concentration of chlorophyll a, while the

   Paraphysomonas imperforata releases macromolecular dissolved organic

   cultures and the accumulation of H-3-DOM was measured. Flagellates
   released a large amount of macromolecular DOM (6 to 57 \% of H-3-DOM)
   that was rich in lipids (lipid : macromolecular ratio = 0.20 : 0.92).
   One component of the macromolecular DOM was a digestive enzyme (acid
   phosphatase) of the flagellate. The flagellate acid phosphatase was not
   degraded by proteases, but it was susceptible to proteases after
   treatment with polymyxin B, which destroys bacterial membranes. These
   data suggest that bacterial membranes protected the released acid
   phosphatase from proteolytic attack. Ultracentrifugation showed that the
   sedimentation coefficient of the phosphatase was 15 to 42 S, consistent
   with the hypothesis that the phosphatase is part of a macromolecular
   complex. We hypothesize that flagellates release their own digestive

Abstract = {{Predicting the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle requires an
   understanding of the stoichiometric coupling between carbon and growth-
   limiting elements in biogeochemical processes. A recent addition to such
   knowledge is that the carbon/nitrogen ratio of inorganic consumption and
   release of dissolved organic matter may increase in a high-CO2 world(1).
   This will, however, yield a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 only if
   the extra organic material escapes mineralization within the photic
   zone. Here we show, in the context of an Arctic pelagic ecosystem, how
   the fate and effects of added degradable organic carbon depend
   critically on the state of the microbial food web. When bacterial growth
   rate was limited by mineral nutrients, extra organic carbon accumulated
   in the system. When bacteria were limited by organic carbon, however,
   addition of labile dissolved organic carbon reduced phytoplankton
   biomass and activity and also the rate at which total organic carbon
   accumulated, explained as the result of stimulated bacterial competition
   for mineral nutrients. This counterintuitive `more organic carbon gives
   less organic carbon' effect was particularly pronounced in diatom-
   dominated systems where the carbon/ mineral nutrient ratio in
   phytoplankton production was high. Our results highlight how
   descriptions of present and future states of the oceanic carbon cycle
   require detailed understanding of the stoichiometric coupling between
   carbon and growth- limiting mineral nutrients in both autotrophic and
   heterotrophic processes.}},

Abstract = {{Methylmercury production by sulfate reducing bacteria in coastal
   sediments leads to bioaccumulation of mercury in fish, shellfish, and
   ultimately humans. Sulfur, organic carbon, and sediment structure and
   composition can all affect methylmercury production by changing the
   amount of bioavailable inorganic mercury and by stimulating the activity
   of methylating microbes. This study investigates total and methylmercury
   in solids and porewaters relative to total sulfide concentration, redox
   potential, sediment grain size, and total organic carbon in a range of
   sediment types from the Bay of Fundy region of Canada. Using these data,
   we construct a conceptual model of the biogeochemical environment
   surrounding methylating microbes in high sulfide, organically enriched
   sediments. Whereas other studies of methylmercury dynamics measured
   porewater sulfide concentrations in relatively low-sulfide systems
   (similar to 20-300 mu M), we measured total sulfide levels using a
   method developed to indicate organic enrichment across a much wider
   range of sulfidic sediments (10-4000 mu M). We observed that higher
   sulfide concentrations correspond to an elevated fraction of mercury in
   methylated form suggesting higher net methylation rates in these
   sediments. This relationship is strongest in sediments that are
   moderately impacted by organic enrichment, but weak in less impacted,
   aerobic sediments. Higher sulfide concentrations in porewaters
   containing dissolved organic matter appear to yield a geochemical
   environment that is conducive to uptake of Hg(II) by methylating
   bacteria. Data collected in this study imply that moderate levels of
   organic enrichment through fish farming may enhance methylmercury
   production in the Bay of Fundy. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   were recognized a quarter century ago, yet their impact on host
   populations remains largely unresolved. By contrast, fungal and
   protozoan infections of dinoflagellates are well documented and
   generally viewed as playing major roles in host population dynamics. Our
   understanding of fungal parasites is largely based on studies for
   freshwater diatoms and dinoflagellates, although fungal infections are
   known for some marine phytoplankton. In freshwater systems, fungal
   chytrids have been linked to mass mortalities of host organisms,
   suppression or retardation of phytoplankton blooms, and selective
   effects on species composition leading to successional changes in
   plankton communities. Parasitic dinoflagellates of the genus Amoebophrya
   and the newly described Perkinsozoa, Parvilucifera infectans, are widely
   distributed in coastal waters of the world where they commonly infect
   photosynthetic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Recent work indicates
   that these parasites can have significant impacts on host physiology,

Abstract = {{Concurrent distributions of dissolved and suspended particulate organic
   carbon (DOC and POCsusp), nitrogen (DON and PONsusp) and phosphorus (DOP
   and POPsusp), and of suspended particulate inorganic phosphorus
   (PIPsusp), are presented for the open ocean water column. Samples were
   collected along a three-station transect from the upper continental
   slope to the abyssal plain in the eastern North Pacific and from a
   single station in the Southern Ocean. The elemental composition of
   surface sedimentary organic matter (SOM) was also measured at each
   location, and sinking particulate organic matter (POMsink) was measured
   with moored sediment trays over a 110-d period at the abyssal site in
   the eastern North Pacific only. In addition to elemental compositions,
   C: N, C: P and N:P ratios were also calculated. Surface and deep ocean
   concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and inorganic nutrients
   between the two sites displayed distinct differences, although suspended
   POM (POMsusp) concentrations were similar. Concentrations of DOM and
   POMsusp displayed unique C, N and P distributions, with POMsusp
   concentrations generally about 1-2 orders of magnitude less than the
   corresponding DOM concentrations. These differences were likely
   influenced by different biogeochemical factors: whereas the dissolved
   constituents may have been influenced more by the physical regime of the
   study site, suspended particulate matter may have been controlled to a
   greater extent by biological and chemical alteration. Up to 80\% of
   total particulate P in POMsusp, POMsink and SOM consisted of PIP. For
   all organic matter pools measured, elemental ratios reveal that organic
   P is preferentially remineralized over organic C and organic N at both
   sites. Increases in C: P and N : P ratios with depth were also observed
   for DOM at both sites, suggesting that DOP is also preferentially
   degraded over C and N as a function of depth. A simple one-dimensional
   vertical eddy diffusion model was applied to estimate the contributions
   of dissolved and suspended particulate organic C, N and P fluxes from
   the upper mixed layer into the permanent thermocline. Estimated vertical
   DOM fluxes were 28-63\% of the total organic matter fluxes; POMsusp and
   POMsink fluxes were 8-20 and 28-52\% of the total. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Bacterial abundance and leucine incorporation rate were measured
   throughout the water column (depth, 4,000-6,000 mr at stations occupied
   in the equatorial, subtropical, and subarctic Pacific as well as in the
   Bering Sea during three cruises conducted between 1993 and 1997. In
   general, depth-dependent decreases of bacterial abundance and leucine
   incorporation in the bathypelagic layer (depth, >1,000 m) were well
   described by a power function with. remarkably uniform exponents among
   distant locations: average exponents were -0.900 and -1.33 for abundance
   and leucine incorporation, respectively. Depth profiles of bacterial
   properties were complex at some subarctic stations, suggesting lateral
   transport of organic carbon by local eddies. Organic carbon fluxes from
   abyssal sediment to overlying water would explain increases in bacterial
   abundance and leucine incorporation in near-bottom layers. Biomass was
   twofold to fourfold and the production was threefold to sevenfold
   greater in subarctic than in subtropical regions. This latitudinal
   pattern was consistent with the basin-scale distribution of sinking
   fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) reported in the literature.
   Rates of bacterial carbon uptake accounted for 51\% (range, 31-153) and
   23\% (14-58) of deep sinking POC fluxes in subarctic and subtropical
   regions, respectively. Average turnover time of deep bacterial
   assemblages was estimated to be 1-30 yr. These results suggest that deep
   bacterial biomass and production are generally coupled with sinking POC
   fluxes and that organic carbon is substantially transformed within
   bathypelagic environments via a sinking POC --> dissolved organic carbon
   --> bacteria pathway, as previously suggested in the mesopelagic zone.}},

Abstract = {{Methylmercury is a neurotoxin that accumulates in food webs and poses a
   significant risk to human health(1). In natural water bodies,
   methylmercury concentrations remain low due to the degradation of
   methylmercury into inorganic mercury by sunlight, a process known as
   photodecomposition. Rates of photodecomposition are relatively rapid in
   freshwater lakes(2-4), and slow in marine waters(5), but the cause of
   this difference is not clear. Here, we carry out incubation experiments
   with artificial freshwater and seawater samples to examine the
   mechanisms regulating methylmercury photodecomposition. We show that
   singlet oxygen-a highly reactive form of dissolved oxygen generated by
   sunlight falling on dissolved organic matter-drives photodecomposition.
   However, in our experiments the rate of methylmercury degradation
   depends on the type of methylmercury-binding ligand present in the
   water. Relatively fast degradation rates (similar to observations in
   freshwater lakes) were detected when methylmercury species were bound to
   sulphur-containing ligands such as glutathione and mercaptoacetate. In
   contrast, methylmercury-chloride complexes, which are the dominant form
   of methylmercury in marine systems, did not degrade as easily. Our
   results could help to explain why methylmercury photodecomposition rates
   are relatively rapid in freshwater lakes and slow in marine waters.}},

Abstract = {{Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and humic substances contain a

   (O-2(-)) dismutation. First-Order rate coefficients (k(pseudo)) measured
   for this O-2(-) sink in a number of coastal and Chesapeake Bay water
   samples range up to 1.4 s(-1), comparable in magnitude to catalyzed
   dismutation by Cu species. A significant (r(2) = 0.73) correlation is
   observed between k(pseudo) and the optical absorption and salinity of
   individual coastal water samples, suggesting an association with
   non-marine-derived CDOM. The activity of this sink is not changed by
   acidification or boiling of samples but is removed by photooxidation,
   indicating that it is an organic compound, but that it is neither
   enzymatic nor likely to consist of tightly bound metals. The
   stoichiometry of hydrogen peroxide formation from O-2(-) decay indicates
   that this sink is capable of a redox cycle catalyzing the dismutation of
   O-2(-) This CDOM sink combined with the organic copper sink previously
   described will produce a steady-state superoxide concentration in
   coastal waters that is 100-1000-fold lower than that predicted from
   bimolecular dismutation alone. Catalyzed O-2(-) decay was also observed
   in a variety of humic and fulvic acid samples, possibly occurring
   through quinone functionalities. Although the presence of quinone
   moieties in humic and fulvic acids has been demonstrated, there do not
   appear to be good correlations between several measures of quinone

Abstract = {{Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM), a fraction of chromophoric
   DOM, is known to be produced in the deep ocean and is considered to be
   bio-refractory. However, the factors controlling fluorescence properties
   of DOM in the deep ocean are still not well understood. In this study,
   we determined the fluorescence properties of DOM in the deep waters of
   the Okhotsk Sea and the northwestern North Pacific Ocean using
   excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and parallel factor
   analysis (PARAFAC). One protein-like, two humic-like components, and one
   uncertain component, which might be derived from a fluorometer artifact,
   were identified by EEM-PARAFAC. Fluorescence intensity levels of the
   protein-like component were highest in the surface waters, decreased
   with depth, but did not change systematically in the bathypelagic layer
   (1000 m - bottom). Fluorescence characteristics of the two humic-like
   components were similar to those traditionally defined as marine and
   terrestrial humiclike fluorophores. The fluorescence intensity levels of
   the two humic-like components were lowest in the surface waters,
   increased with depth in the mesopelagic layer (200 - 1000 m), and then
   slightly decreased with depth in the bathypelagic layer. The ratio of
   the two humic-like components remained in a relatively narrow range in
   the bathypelagic layer compared to that in the surface layer, suggesting
   a similar composition of humic-like fluorophores in the bathypelagic
   layer. In addition, the fluorescence intensities of the two humic-like
   components were linearly correlated to apparent oxygen utilization (AOU)
   in the bathypelagic layer, suggesting that both humic-like components
   are produced in situ as organic matter is oxidized biologically. These
   findings imply that optical characteristics of humic-like fluorophores
   once formed might not be altered further biologically or geochemically
   in the deep ocean. On the other hand, relationships of fluorescence
   intensities with AOU and Fe(III) solubility were different between the
   two humic-like components in the mesopelagic layer, suggesting different
   environmental dynamics and biogeochemical roles for the two humic-like

Title = {{Terrigenous dissolved organic matter in the Arctic Ocean and its

Journal = {{GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Surface waters of the Arctic Ocean have the highest concentrations
   of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and terrigenous dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) of all ocean basins. Concentrations of dissolved lignin
   phenols in polar surface waters are 7-fold to 16-fold higher than those
   in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and stable carbon isotopic
   compositions of DOM are depleted in C-13 by 1 - 2 parts per thousand
   relative to those in the Atlantic and Pacific. The large contribution of
   terrigenous DOM from Arctic rivers is responsible for the elevated
   concentrations of DOC in polar surface waters. The distribution of
   terrigenous DOM in polar surface waters is very heterogeneous, but on
   average we estimate 14 - 24\% of the DOC is of terrestrial origin.
   Stable nitrogen isotopic compositions were useful for distinguishing DOM
   of Pacific and Atlantic origins as well as terrigenous and marine
   origins. The size distribution and composition of lignin phenols provide
   some evidence of photochemical transformations of terrigenous DOM, but
   it appears this process is not extensive in polar surface waters. The
   extent to which terrigenous DOM is removed from the Arctic Ocean by
   microbial degradation is less clear and warrants further study. Physical
   transport of terrigenous DOC to the North Atlantic is a major mechanism
   for its removal from the Arctic. The East Greenland Current alone
   exports 4.4 - 6.6 Tg of terrigenous DOC annually to the North Atlantic.
   Terrigenous DOC of Arctic origin was identified for the first time in
   components of North Atlantic Deep Water. Preliminary estimates indicate
   that similar to 1 Tg of terrigenous DOC is exported from the Arctic in
   Denmark Strait Overflow Water with an additional similar to 0.7 Tg in
   Classical Labrador Sea Water. Together, these exports compose
   approximately 25 - 33\% of the terrigenous DOC discharged annually to
   the Arctic via rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Humic substances are a heterogeneous class of moderate molecular weight,
   yellow-colored biomolecules present in all soils, sediments, and natural
   waters. Although humic substances are generally resistant to microbial
   degradation under anaerobic conditions, some microorganisms in soils and
   sediments can use quinone moieties in humic substances as electron
   acceptors. Laboratory experiments have shown that humic substances can
   act as electron shuttles in the microbial reduction Of ferric iron.
   Field studies of electron shuttling processes have been constrained by
   the lack of methods to characterize the oxidation state of quinone
   moieties in humic substances at natural concentrations. All humic
   substances have fluorescent properties, and fluorescence spectroscopy
   can indicate differences in precursor organic source of humic
   substances. Here we show that the quinone moieties responsible for
   electron transfer reactions contribute significantly to the fluorescence
   of humic substances. Further we use fluorescence spectroscopy to
   elucidate the oxidation state of quinone moieties in humic substances at
   natural concentrations found in sediment interstitial waters.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen consumption is used to study the dynamics of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) utilization by bacteria. Preliminary incubation experiments
   examining oxygen consumption and bacterial growth demonstrated that a
   small labile fraction of the total DOC pool typically supports bacterial
   metabolism. Bacterial growth and respiration rates were frequently
   fastest within the first few hours of incubation experiments suggesting
   that the pool of organic matter used for growth was rapidly consumed.
   Comparisons of bacterial production and respiration with total DOC
   concentrations suggested that approximately 1 to 3\% of the pool
   supports bacterial growth. The presence of a small labile component of
   the DOC pool suggests a close coupling between bacteria and sources of
   substrate. Bacterial coupling to phytoplankton was examined in mesocosm
   experiments in which phytoplankton were enriched with nutrients and
   bacterial production and oxygen consumption were followed over diel
   cycles. Bacterial production, oxygen consumption and the availability of
   organic matter were highest during daylight, when phytoplankton
   production was assumed to be greatest. The effect of a varying carbon
   supply over diel cycles on bacterial growth efficiency was examined.
   During the mesocosm experiment, growth efficiencies were greatest during
   daylight when substrate availability was greatest. At several estuarine
   sites, efficiencies varied markedly over daily and seasonal temporal
   scales. These results suggest that growth efficiency is an important
   consideration when estimating the bacterial role in aquatic carbon
   cycles.}},

Title = {{Net removal of major marine dissolved organic carbon fractions in the

Journal = {{GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{FEB 4}},
Abstract = {{Marine dissolved organic matter is a massive reservoir of carbon holding
   >200x the ocean biomass inventory. Primarily produced at the ocean
   surface and then exported to depth with overturn of the water column,
   this carbon can be sequestered in the ocean interior for centuries.
   Understanding the loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) upon export has
   been data limited, but recent global ocean surveys are overcoming that
   problem. Here we characterize three fractions of exported carbon by
   apparent continuity in removal rates: semi-labile and semi-refractory,
   summing to 20 PgC, and the balance as refractory DOC. Distinct lifetimes
   coupled with ocean circulation control where the fractions are exported
   to depth, and thus the carbon sequestration time scales. Maximum
   remineralization rates of exported DOC occur in the convergent
   subtropical gyres, where a range of similar to 500 to <1500 mmol C m(-2)
   yr(-1) can exceed remineralization of sinking biogenic particles.
   Regions of high particle export production and highly stratified systems
   exhibit minimal exported DOC remineralization.}},

Abstract = {{The processing of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) by aquatic
   food webs modifies its biochemical composition from riverine to coastal
   ecosystems. We used parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of fluorescence
   excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) and biodegradable dissolved organic
   carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate changes in the biochemical
   composition and lability of terrigenous DOM in three estuaries of
   coastal southeastern Alaska: 1) a watershed with high glacial coverage,
   2) low glacial coverage, and 3) low glacial coverage and high wetland
   coverage. Laboratory BDOC incubations were conducted for each site by
   inoculating filtered river water with microbial inocula collected from
   four different salinities (0, 2, 10 and 25) along the estuarine
   transect. The percent BDOC for all three sites ranged from 22 to 44\%
   for the 28-day incubations and was greatest in the estuary draining the
   highly glaciated watershed. Moreover, percent BDOC was greatest for
   river water samples inoculated with marine compared to freshwater
   bacteria suggesting marine bacterioplankton were able to utilize a
   larger fraction of the terrigenous DOM pool than riverine microbes.
   PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence EEMs showed non-conservative estuarine
   mixing behavior for DOM including removal at low salinities and addition
   at mid-high salinities for all three sites. For example, tyrosine-like
   fluorescence decreased dramatically between salinity values 0 and 0.5
   and was undetectable by salinity 2 for all three estuaries. However.
   humic-like C4 (correlated with aliphatic carbon content) and
   tryptophan-like fluorescence increased non-conservatively during
   estuarine mixing, likely associated with an increase in bacterioplankton
   growth. These results indicate that terrigenous DOM, particularly from
   glacial runoff, is an important source of carbon and nutrients to
   near-shore coastal zones of southeast Alaska. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)

   fluorescence, absorption at 312 nm (a(312)), dissolved organic carbon,

   four fluorescent components and lignin phenols suggests a terrestrial

   terrestrial components were observed in the Mackenzie River plume near
   the coast of Alaska and decreased as water was transported to the
   Canadian Archipelago. The two nonterrestrial components exhibited only
   background levels in concentrations along the transect, suggesting
   minimal productivity within plume and archipelago surface waters. The
   relative abundance of terrestrial components in relation to
   nonterrestrial components allowed us to distinguish water masses
   including Atlantic, Archipelago, and Mackenzie River plume,
   respectively. This study illustrates the usefulness of PARAFAC to
   fingerprint water masses based on the optical characteristics of CDOM
   and shows promise to improve our understanding of upper Arctic Ocean
   ventilation.}},

Abstract = {{Biogenic methane is widely thought to be a product of archaeal
   methanogenesis, an anaerobic process that is inhibited or outcompeted by
   the presence of oxygen and sulfate(1-3). Yet a large fraction of marine
   methane delivered to the atmosphere is produced in high-sulfate, fully
   oxygenated surface waters that have methane concentrations above
   atmospheric equilibrium values, an unexplained phenomenon referred to as
   the marine methane paradox(4,5). Here we use nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy to show that polysaccharide esters of three phosphonic
   acids are important constituents of dissolved organic matter in seawater
   from the North Pacific. In seawater and pure culture incubations,
   bacterial degradation of these dissolved organic matter phosphonates in
   the presence of oxygen releases methane, ethylene and propylene gas.
   Moreover, we found that in mutants of a methane-producing marine
   bacterium, Pseudomonas stutzeri, disrupted in the C-P lyase phosphonate
   degradation pathway, methanogenesis was also disabled, indicating that
   the C-P lyase pathway can catalyse methane production from marine
   dissolved organic matter. Finally, the carbon stable isotope ratio of
   methane emitted during our incubations agrees well with anomalous
   isotopic characteristics of seawater methane. We estimate that daily
   cycling of only about 0.25\% of the organic matter phosphonate inventory
   would support the entire atmospheric methane flux at our study site. We
   conclude that aerobic bacterial degradation of phosphonate esters in
   dissolved organic matter may explain the marine methane paradox.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the biological lability of fluorescent dissolved organic
   matter (FDOM) from a temperate Piedmont stream. Plug-flow bioreactors,
   colonized and maintained with natural stream water, were used to
   determine the concentrations of stream-water biodegradable dissolved
   organic carbon (BDOC) and relative concentrations of FDOM within
   operationally defined biodegradability classes. Labile molecules with
   turnover times of hours are metabolized within the stream reach where
   they originated; semi-labile molecules with turnover times of days
   travel out of the reach and are transported downstream before being
   metabolized; and a more recalcitrant class with a longer but
   undetermined turnover time flows through the river network without being
   metabolized. Between 26\% and 31\% of the DOC was biodegradable, with
   8.6\% labile and the balance semi-labile. Humic-like FDOM was a proxy
   for more recalcitrant DOM, exhibiting a +/- 2\% change as a function of
   increased bioreactor residence time. Humic-like FDOM represents only the
   more recalcitrant and perhaps the more hydrophobic constituents and not
   the ecologically important semi-labile humic substances within the BDOC
   pool. Tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like FDOM constituents included not
   only labile DOM, but also semi-labile, and more recalcitrant moieties.
   For example, 13\% of the tryptophan-like FDOM was labile, 14\% was
   semi-labile, and 73\% was more recalcitrant, while tyrosine-like FDOM
   was 100\% biodegraded and the majority (44-69\%) was classified as
   labile. Collectively our results challenge some previous assessments of
   FDOM lability classifications and highlight the need to connect
   fluorescence characteristics of DOM to residence times of different
   carbon pools that spiral through a river network.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated levels of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved
   inorganic nitro-en (DIN) are among the factors implicated in the
   initiation of algal blooms. However, the degree to which phytoplankton
   augment their autotrophic metabolism with heterotrophic uptake of
   organic carbon that is associated with DON is unknown. We evaluated the
   relative importance of peptide hydrolysis, amino acid oxidation, and
   amino acid uptake over a seasonal cycle in an embayment on Long Island,
   New York, that had high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   and a bloom of the brown tide pelagophyte, Aureococcus anophagefferens.
   Amino acids were a significant component (LIP to 50\%) of the total N
   uptake, particularly during the late summer. About half of the
   associated amino acid C was also taken LIP. Amino acid oxidation rates
   were in older of magnitude lower than free amino acid uptake rates, but
   still supplied up to 32.5\% of the NH4+ taken up. Up to 75\% of the
   amino acid oxidation was in the bacterial size fraction (<1.2 mum). and
   rates were significantly correlated with bacterial densities. Peptide
   hydrolysis rates were high, and most (up to 72\%) occurred in the brown
   tide size fraction (1.2-5 mum). The high rates of peptide hydrolysis and
   amino acid uptake Measured ill Cultures of A. anophagefferens confirm
   that this species can readily hydrolyze peptides and take up N and C
   from amino acids. Laboratory findings and size-fractionation Studies in
   the field suggest that A. anophagefferens plays major role in
   consumption of both C and N from DOM.}},

Abstract = {{We explored various aspects of freshwater dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   lability by comparing short-term (< 2 d) bacterial C consumption (STCC;
   derived from bacterial respiration measurements) with long-term (28 d) C
   consumption (LTCC) in DOC bioassays in lakes, rivers, and marshes
   located within the same complex drainage basin in southern Quebec. We
   also combined STCC and LTCC measurements to estimate the proportion of
   DOC removed, and to derive a first-order decay constant (k). STCC rates
   were, on average, 25\% higher than LTCC, and both parameters showed
   distinct patterns, reaching their lowest and highest values in lakes and
   marshes, respectively. STCC and LTCC were correlated to DOC
   concentration across these freshwater ecosystems, whereas in lakes, STCC
   was positively correlated to chlorophyll and LTCC to terrestrial C
   inputs. k showed no ecosystem-specific patterns but was negatively
   correlated to chlorophyll across systems. The size of the DOC pools
   supporting STCC and LTCC, as well as k, were related to distinct
   components of the DOC pool, as revealed by a parallel factor analysis of
   fluorescent dissolved organic matter excitation-emission spectra.
   Short-and long-term lability and C consumption, and the resulting k, are
   shown to be complementary facets of DOC bioavailability, which may play
   very different roles on aquatic ecosystem functioning.}},

Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{Produced on land by incomplete combustion of organic matter, black
   carbon (BC) enters the ocean by aerosol and river deposition. It has
   been postulated that BC resides in the marine dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) pool before sedimentary deposition and may attribute to its great
   C-14 age (1500-6500 C-14 years). Here we report the first radiocarbon
   measurements of BC in high molecular weight DOC (UDOM). BC exported from
   rivers is highly aromatic and <500 C-14 years old, while open ocean
   samples contain less aromatic BC and have an age of 18,000 +/- 3,000
   C-14 years. The low abundance of BC in UDOM (0.5-3.5\%) suggests that it
   is more labile than presently believed and/or the low molecular weight
   DOC contains a larger proportion of aged BC. Citation: Ziolkowski, L.

Abstract = {{The optical properties of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) can
   be used, in some environments, to trace water masses and provide
   information about the dynamics of the dissolved organic fraction in
   natural waters. This work presents the results from a modelling
   exercise, laboratory experiment and field data, which describe the
   variations in the optical properties of CDOM during mixing. The
   exponential slope coefficient (S) is frequently used to characterise
   different CDOM pools; however, its behaviour during conservative mixing
   of two different CDOM types is often misunderstood. Identification of a
   theoretical conservative mixing line allows the rapid identification of
   non-conservative processes (e.g. in situ production, flocculation and
   degradation) acting on the pool during mixing. The results suggest that
   some of the patterns reported in the literature could purely be a result
   of conservative mixing rather than a product of non-conservative
   processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The study of vertical particle dynamics in the highly turbid Gironde
   Estuary has shown intense cycles of sedimentation and resuspension at
   both diurnal and neap-spring time scales. Fluid mud, with suspended
   particulate matter (SPM) concentrations between 50 and 500 g liter(-1),
   has been observed during neap tides. Vertical profiles of biogeochemical
   parameters have been measured in the fluid mud. Anoxic conditions have
   been detected when SPM concentration exceeded 50 g liter(-1) in the
   upstream and 140 g liter(-1) in the downstream parts of the maximum
   turbidity zone (MTZ). At the downstream parr of the MTZ, anoxic fluid
   mud was partitioned into denitrification layer (SPM = 140-250 g
   liter(-1)), intensively reworked at the tidal time scale, and by an
   Mn(IV)-reduction layer (SPM > 250 g liter(-1)) preferentially reworked
   at the neap-spring time scale. Due to the alternation of sedimentation
   and resuspension periods, most of the sediment experienced oxic/anoxic
   oscillations throughout the neap-spring cycle. Fluid mud resuspension
   occurred without any observable incidence on the surface-water
   oxygenation. An increase in total alkalinity was found in the fluid mud,
   due to both anaerobic respiration and a carbonate dissolution coupled to
   aerobic respiratory CO(2) generation. This phenomenon significantly
   affected the inorganic carbon budget of the estuary, increasing the
   HCO(3)(-) input to the coastal ocean and reducing the CO(2) flux to the
   atmosphere. An accumulation of labile-dissolved organic carbon observed
   in the fluid mud suggests that these oscillations result in an
   acceleration of particulate organic matter (POM) decomposition. in the
   Gironde MTZ, a net loss of refractory land-derived POM occurs. This
   system acts as an efficient oxic/suboxic ``'fluidized bed reactor,{''}
   similar to mobile deltaic muds.}},

Abstract = {{The algal storage glucan laminarin is one of the most abundant carbon
   sources for marine prokaryotes. Its degradation was investigated in
   bacteria isolated during and after a spring phytoplankton bloom in the
   coastal North Sea. On average, 13\% of prokaryotes detected by
   epifluorescence counts were able to grow in Most Probable Number
   dilution series on laminarin as sole carbon source. Several bacterial
   strains were isolated from different dilutions, and phylogenetic
   characterization revealed that they belonged to different phylogenetic
   groups. The activity of the laminarin-degrading enzyme systems was
   further characterized in three strains of Vibrio sp. that were able to
   grow on laminarin as sole carbon source. At least two types of activity
   were detected upon degradation of laminarin: release of glucose, and
   release of glucans larger than glucose. The expression of laminarinase
   activity was dependent on the presence of the substrate, and was
   repressed by the presence of glucose. In addition, low levels of
   activity were expressed under starvation conditions. Laminarinase
   enzymes showed minimal activity on substrates with similar glucosidic
   bonds to those of laminarin, but different sizes and secondary and/or
   tertiary structures. The characteristics found in these enzyme systems
   may help to elucidate factors hampering rapid carbohydrate degradation
   by prokaryotes.}},

Pages = {{3908-3915}},

Abstract = {{A multivariate kinetic model of aqueous fipronil photodegradation was
   developed as a function of dissolved organic matter (DOM), bicarbonate,
   and nitrate at concentrations that bracket those commonly observed in
   natural waters (ca. 0-10 mg/L). Several pathways were available for
   fipronil photodegradation in this system, including direct photolysis
   and indirect photooxidation by species produced during the illumination
   of natural waters (e.g., (NOM)-N-3{*}, O-1(2){*}, (OH)-O-., (CO31-)-C-.,
   (OOR)-O-., (OOH)-O-., e(aq)(-), O-2(.-)). Product studies indicated that
   fipronil was quantitatively converted to fipronil desulfinyl, a product
   that is associated with direct photolysis alone. DOM was the only
   variable that affected fipronil degradation; it decreased the rate of
   fipronil photodegradation primarily through competitive light absorption
   (i.e., attenuation) and the quenching of fipronil{*}. The addition of
   sodium chloride (30parts per thousand) resulted in a more rapid rate
   (similar to20\%) of fipronil loss in comparison to equivalent
   experiments performed without sodium chloride, implying that fipronil
   may be more photolabile in marine environments.}},

Abstract = {{The European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM) is one of the most
   established ecosystem models for the lower trophic levels of the marine
   food web in the scientific literature. Since its original development in
   the early nineties it has evolved significantly from a coastal ecosystem
   model for the North Sea to a generic tool for ecosystem simulations from
   shelf seas to the global ocean. The current model release contains all
   essential elements for the pelagic and benthic parts of the marine
   ecosystem, including the microbial food web, the carbonate system, and
   calcification. Its distribution is accompanied by a testing framework
   enabling the analysis of individual parts of the model. Here we provide
   a detailed mathematical description of all ERSEM components along with
   case studies of mesocosm-type simulations, water column implementations,
   and a brief example of a full-scale application for the north-western
   European shelf. Validation against in situ data demonstrates the
   capability of the model to represent the marine ecosystem in contrasting
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) encompasses one of the largest
   reservoirs of carbon on Earth. Heterotrophic bacteria are the primary
   biotic force regulating the fate of this material, yet the capacity of
   individual strains to significantly contribute to carbon cycling is
   unknown. Here we quantified the ability of a single Alteromonas strain
   {[}Alteromonas sp. strain Scripps Institution of Oceanography (AltSIO)]
   to drawdown ambient DOC in a coastal ecosystem. In three experiments,
   AltSIO alone consumed the entire pool of labile DOC, defined here as the
   quantity consumed by the submicron size fraction of ambient microbial
   assemblages within 5 d. These findings demonstrate that complete removal
   of the labile DOC pool in coastal surface seawater can be achieved by a
   single taxon. During long-term incubations (>1 y) testing semilabile DOC
   consumption, AltSIO entered dormancy but remained viable, while the
   diverse assemblages continued to consume carbon. Given that AltSIO is a
   large bacterium and thus subject to increased grazing pressure, we
   sought to determine the ecological relevance of this phenotype. Growth
   dynamics in natural seawater revealed that AltSIO rapidly outgrew the
   native bacteria, and despite intense grazing pressure, was never
   eliminated from the population. A survey in the California Current
   Ecosystem revealed that large bacteria (>= 40 fg C.cell(-1)) were
   persistent, accounting for up to 12\% of total bacterial abundance and
   24\% of total bacterial biomass. We conclude that large, rapidly growing
   bacteria have the potential to disproportionately alter the fate of
   carbon in the mesotrophic ocean and play an important role in ecosystem
   function.}},

Abstract = {{Application of cross-flow ultrafiltration techniques to marine systems
   has greatly increased in recent years. However, the retention and
   permeation behavior of macromolecules and their associated trace
   elements during ultrafiltration is still controversial. In addition, the
   optimum concentration factor (CF) and the possibility for a
   ``breakthrough{''} of high molecular weight (HMW) dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) during ultrafiltration are still a matter of contention.
   The permeation and retention behavior of natural DOG, standard
   macromolecules and selected metals was examined on a 1 kDa Amicon S10N1
   ultrafiltration cartridge, using molecular probes and radioactive metals
   spiked to natural seawater. Laboratory results from molecular probes
   show that significant fractions (> 40\%) of low molecular weight (LMW)
   molecules (0.5 kDa rhodamine 6G and 0.6 kDa glutathione) are retained by
   a 1 kDa ultrafilter membrane, even under a CF of similar to 50.
   Therefore, the retention of LMW molecules can give rise to an
   overestimate of the colloidal fraction, especially under lower CFs. The
   percentage of HMW molecules passing through the I kDa membrane decreases
   rapidly with increasing size or MW. On average, similar to 15\% of
   vitamin B-12 (1.3 kDa) and similar to 3\% of a 3 kDa dextran pass
   through the 1 kDa membrane. However, permeation of a 10 kDa dextran
   through the 1 kDa membrane becomes negligible (< 0.6\%). Thus, the
   permeation of HMW molecules is minimal during ultrafiltration, even
   under high CFs. The ultrafiltration behavior of natural DOC and LMW
   metals can be well predicted by a permeation model, and consistently
   shows an increasing concentration in the permeate with increasing CFs.
   Standard dextrans, rhodamine 6G and natural DOC are recovered at
   92-95\%, while losses of glutathione and vitamin B-12 to the membrane
   can be significant. Possible sorptive losses and overall mass balance of
   molecules are thus dominated by their physicochemical properties but not
   by their MWs. Most retained LMW DOC can be further removed during
   diafiltration whereas loss of HMW DOC during diafiltration is minimal.
   Since retention of LMW molecules is the main problem rather than the
   permeation of HMW molecules, a high CF (> 40) is recommended for
   isolating marine colloids by ultrafiltration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Benthic fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured over an
   annual cycle at two contrasting sites in Chesapeake Bay. At an
   organic-rich, sulfidic site in the mesohaline portion of the Bay (site
   M) DOC fluxes from the sediments ranged from 1.4 to 2.9 mmol/m2/d.
   Measured benthic DOC fluxes at site M corresponded to approximately
   3-13\% of the depth-integrated benthic C remineralization rates
   (SIGMAOCR), and agreed well with calculated diffusive DOC fluxes based
   on porewater DOC profiles. This agreement suggests that DOC fluxes from
   site M sediments were likely controlled by molecular diffusion. The
   second site that was studied is a heavily bioturbated site in the
   southern Bay (site S). The activity of macrobenthos did not appear to
   enhance DOC fluxes from these sediments, since measured benthic DOC
   fluxes (<0.5 mmol/m2/d) were lower than those at site M. The ratios of
   benthic DOC fluxes to SIGMAOCR values at site S were also slightly
   smaller than those observed at site M.
   Benthic DOC fluxes from Chesapeake Bay sediments do not appear to
   significantly affect the transport of DOC through this estuary, although
   uncertainties in the reactivity of DOC in estuaries makes this
   conclusion somewhat tentative at this time. However, when these results
   are used to make a lower limit estimate of the globally integrated
   benthic DOC flux from marine sediments, a value similar to that
   previously calculated by BURDIGE et al. (1992) is obtained. This
   observation further supports suggestions in this paper about the
   importance of benthic DOC fluxes in the oceanic C cycle.}},

Abstract = {{We simulate the oceanic and atmospheric distribution of methyl iodide
   (CH3I) with a global 3-D model driven by assimilated meteorological
   observations from the Goddard Earth Observing System of the NASA Data
   Assimilation Office and coupled to an oceanic mixed layer model. A
   global compilation of atmospheric and oceanic observations is used to
   constrain and evaluate the simulation. Seawater CH3I( aq) in the model
   is produced photochemically from dissolved organic carbon, and is
   removed by reaction with Cl- and emission to the atmosphere. The net
   oceanic emission to the atmosphere is 214 Gg yr(-1). Small terrestrial
   emissions from rice paddies, wetlands, and biomass burning are also
   included in the model. The model captures 40\% of the variance in the
   observed seawater CH3I( aq) concentrations. Simulated concentrations at
   midlatitudes in summer are too high, perhaps because of a missing
   biological sink of CH3I( aq). We define a marine convection index (MCI)
   as the ratio of upper tropospheric (8-12 km) to lower tropospheric
   (0-2.5 km) CH3I concentrations averaged over coherent oceanic regions.
   The MCI in the observations ranges from 0.11 over strongly subsiding
   regions (southeastern subtropical Pacific) to 0.40 over strongly
   upwelling regions (western equatorial Pacific). The model reproduces the
   observed MCI with no significant global bias (offset of only +11\%) but
   accounts for only 15\% of its spatial and seasonal variance. The MCI can
   be used to test marine convection in global models, complementing the
   use of radon-222 as a test of continental convection.}},

Abstract = {{Alphaproteobacteria are common members of marine bacterioplankton
   assemblages, but are believed to be rare in lacustrine systems. However,
   uncultured Alphaproteobacteria of the freshwater LD12 lineage form a
   tight monophyletic sister group with the numerically dominant bacteria
   in marine epipelagic waters, the SAR11 clade or genus Pelagibacter.
   Comparative rRNA sequence analysis reveals a global occurrence of LD12
   bacteria in freshwater systems. The association of genotypic subclades
   with single-study systems moreover suggests a regional diversification.
   LD12 bacteria exhibit distinct and annually recurring spatio-temporal
   distribution patterns in prealpine lakes, as assessed by seasonally
   resolved vertical profiling and high-throughput cell counting. During
   the summer months, these ultramicrobacteria can form cell densities in
   the surface (epilimnetic) water layers that are comparable to those of
   their marine counterparts (>5 x 10(8) cells per l). LD12 bacteria had a
   pronounced preference for glutamine and glutamate over 7 other amino
   acids in situ, and they exhibited substantially higher uptake of these
   two substrates (and glycine) than the microbial assemblage in general.
   In addition, members of LD12 were also able to exploit other monomeric
   sources of organic carbon such as glucose, fructose or acetate. LD12
   seemed to follow an oligotrophic lifestyle with slow but efficient
   uptake already at low substrate concentrations. Thus, LD12 bacteria do
   not only share phenotypic and metabolic traits with Pelagibacter, but
   also seem to thrive in the analogous spatiotemporal niche in
   freshwaters. The two groups together form one of the rare monophyletic
   lineages of ultramicrobacteria that have successfully traversed the
   barrier between marine and freshwater habitats. The ISME Journal (2011)

Abstract = {{Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) was separated by reversed-phase
   (RP) liquid chromatography method and analyzed with
   fluorenscence/absorption detection and Fourier transform ion cyclotron

   method are: (a) The C18-RP column chosen provides enhanced separation
   when the aqueous phase is 100\% buffer-free water. and it does not
   degrade over time; (b) the water eluent adjusted to pH 7 significantly
   improves the resolution of water soluble compounds; (c) the initial flow
   maintained at low levels improves the separation of polar compounds. In
   samples, containing ``fresh{''} DOM, specific peaks were detected, which
   were absent in ``old{''} DOM samples. The combination with size
   exclusion chromatography (SEC) also demonstrated the relation between
   polarity and molecular size of DOM. FT-ICR-MS was applied to evaluate
   the quality of separation on a molecular scale demonstrating that
   physico-chemical characteristics of DOM can be related to molecular
   formulas. Sample extracts were separated into 4 preparative fractions,
   and a large suite of the identified molecular formulas only occurred in
   specific fractions. This is an important basis for the application of
   further analytical techniques in order to perform a more target-oriented
   analysis aiming at the determination of source and process biomarkers

Abstract = {{Bioaccumulation of hydrophobic organic chemicals from sediments
   containing soot or sootlike materials has been hypothesized to be
   limited by strong sorption of the chemicals to the soot matrixes. To
   test this hypothesis, we quantified bioaccumulation of 11
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the aquatic oligochaete
   Limnodrilus sp. exposed to spiked sediment with and without the sootlike
   materials coal and charcoal. In addition, sorption experiments with
   sediment containing varying amounts of coal or charcoal were performed
   to elucidate the accumulation mechanism. Results showed that coal and
   charcoal (at realistic levels of 1.5\% on a dry-wt basis) reduced PCB
   accumulation in worms 1.2 to 8.5 times when expressed oil a mass basis.
   Moreover, whereas bioaccumulation from pure sediment increased with
   molecular planarity of the PCBs (toxic potency), it decreased in case of
   sediments containing coal and charcoal. In contrast to this advantageous
   effect, it was hypothesized that coal and charcoal had an adverse
   influence on the habitat quality of oligochaetes: Organisms inhabiting
   sediment containing coal or charcoal had significantly reduced lipid
   contents as compared to organisms from pure sediment. Because of these
   reduced lipid contents, lipid-normalized PCB concentrations in worms and
   biota-to-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) for most PCBs were higher
   in sediments containing the sootlike materials as compared to those for
   reference sediment. Also, measured BSAFs for coal- and
   charcoal-containing sediments appeared to be much higher than estimated
   on the basis of equilibrium partitioning theory. Sorption experiments
   revealed that this was caused by much weaker sorption to the
   sediment-coal/charcoal mixture than calculated assuming linear
   additivity of sorption capacities of the distinct phases. It was
   hypothesized that this weaker sorption resulted from competition between
   PCBs and dissolved organic carbon molecules for sorption sites on
   coal/charcoal. This points to a sorption process that is much more
   complicated than generally assumed.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of humic acid (HA) on the toxicity of copper to sea urchin
   Paracentrotus lividus larvae were studied in chemically defined
   seawater. Square Wave Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (SWASV) was employed
   to study the complexation of copper in seawater medium. A simple
   complexation model assuming one ligand type and a 1:1 reaction
   stoichiometry successfully explained the inverse titration experiments.
   A conditional stability constant of 6.53 +/- 0.05 and a complexating
   capacity of 230 +/- 7 mumol Cu/g HA were obtained. Sea urchin bioassay
   tests with two endpoints, embryogenesis success and larval growth were
   carried out in order to study the toxicity of dissolved copper in both
   the presence and absence of HA. The toxicity data obtained fitted well
   into a logistic model, and the high sensitivity of both endpoints (EC50
   were 41.1 mug Cu/l and 32.9 mug Cu/l, respectively) encourages their use
   for biomonitoring. The HA had a clearly protective effect, reducing the
   toxicity of Cu to the sea urchin larvae. The labile copper, rather than
   the total copper concentrations, explained the toxicity of the Cu-HA
   solutions, and the Cu-HA complexes appeared as non-toxic forms. These
   results are in agreement with the Free Ion Activity Model, because the
   labile Cu concentrations in this buffered and chemically defined medium
   covary with the free ion activity of the Cu, validating the model to
   naturally occurring HA in the marine environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Quantum yield spectra for the photochemical formation of biologically
   labile photoproducts from dissolved organic matter (DOM) have not been
   available previously, although they Would greatly facilitate attempts to
   model photoproduct formation rates across latitudinal, seasonal, and
   depth-related changes in spectral irradiance. Apparent quantum yield
   spectra were calculated for two coastal environments from the
   southeastern United States using postirradiation bacterial respiration
   as a measure of total labile photoproduct formation and a cutoff filter
   method to model spectral dependence. As has been the case for previously
   studied classes of DOM photoproducts (i.e., dissolved inorganic carbon,
   CO, and H2O2), ultraviolet (UV)-B irradiance was significantly more
   efficient at forming labile photoproducts (i.e., compounds readily
   assimilated by marine bacterioplankton) than UV-A and visible
   irradiance. Calculations of DOM photoproduct formation in southeastern
   U.S. coastal surface waters indicate a formation ratio for biologically
   labile photoproducts: CO of 13:1. The slope of a natural log plot of the
   apparent quantum yield spectrum obtained for biologically labile
   photoproducts was similar to that for CO (0.028 nm (1) vs. 0.034
   nm(-1)). Modeled kinetic rates therefore indicate that the production
   ratio of these photoproduct classes is approximately maintained despite
   variations in the solar spectrum that occur with depth in a water column
   or distance from shore. Application of the apparent quantum yield to
   coastal regions worldwide predicts an annual formation rate of
   biologically labile photoproducts in coastal waters of 206 x 10(12) g C.}},

Abstract = {{We examined soil porewater concentrations of sulfate, alkalinity,

   concentrations of pyrite in relation to mangrove species distributions
   along a 3.1-km-long transect that traversed a 47.1-km(2) mangrove forest
   in the Dominican Republic. Iron, phosphorus, and sulfur dynamics are
   closely coupled to the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria, the
   primary decomposers in anoxic soils of mangrove ecosystems. Patterns in
   the chemistry data suggested that sulfate reduction rates and storage of
   reduced sulfur were greater in the inland basin forest dominated by
   Laguncularia racemosa than the Rhizophora mangle dominated forest of the
   lower tidal region. The distribution of Laguncularia was significantly
   correlated with concentrations of total phosphorus (r = 0.99) and
   dissolved organic carbon (r = 0.86), alkalinity (r = 0.60), and the
   extent of sulfate depletion (r = 0.77) in the soil porewater and soil
   pyrite concentrations (r = 0.72) across the tidal gradient. Leaf tissue
   chemistry of Laguncularia in was characterized by lower C:N and C:P
   ratios that could fuel the higher rates of decomposition in the

Abstract = {{Electrospray ionization (ESI) combined with ultrahigh resolution Fourier
   Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) at 9.4
   Tesla has been shown to be an ideal tool for the molecular
   characterization of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM). Here, we
   apply this technique for tracing DOM as it moves from mangrove
   porewaters into a Brazilian estuary and assess the changes that occur in
   the initial stages of outwelling. Comparisons of molecular features of
   DOM from the porewater and two sites within the adjacent estuary
   revealed that mass spacing patterns were far more pronounced in the
   mangrove porewater DOM, and the average molecular weights of estuarine
   DOM were lower. Calculation of double bond equivalents and Kendrick mass
   analysis normalized for both methylene (-CH2-) and oxygen (O)
   substitution indicated that the lower molecular weights observed in the
   estuarine DOM were due primarily to loss of high molecular weight,
   highly unsaturated and/or aromatic components observed in the porewater
   DOM. Photodegradation is suggested as one mechanism that removes these
   high molecular weight components once mangrove-derived DOM reaches the
   estuary. The mass analyses were supported by UV-Vis and 3-D synchronous
   scanning fluorescence spectroscopy measurements to aid in the
   characterization of DOM in this unique ecosystem. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Bacterial assemblages in coastal pelagic environments are exposed to
   pronounced temporal and spatial fluctuations in the availability of
   monomeric substrates. Little is known about the response of particular
   bacterial groups to such variability. We studied glucose incorporation
   at various concentrations (0.1-100 nM) by bacteria related to
   Roseobacter, SAR11, Gammaproteobacteria and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria in
   coastal North Sea waters in late winter and during a spring
   phytoplankton bloom dominated by Phaeocystis sp. (March and May 2004
   respectively). Both the fraction of glucose-assimilating bacterial cells
   and the rate of substrate incorporation per active cell were higher in
   May. The respective contributions of the studied groups to all
   glucose-assimilating Bacteria were related to substrate concentration.
   The majority of glucose-incorporating bacterial cells at the lower
   concentrations were members of the Roseobacter and SAR11 clades. At both
   time-points the two groups formed approximately equal fractions of all
   glucose-incorporating bacteria. This was due to a small population of
   highly active Roseobacter cells and high abundances of SAR11 bacteria
   with low proportions of glucose-incorporating cells. By contrast, the
   proportion of active cells from the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria lineage
   substantially increased at higher levels of available substrate. The
   determination of concentration-dependent substrate incorporation
   patterns may help to better understand the different ecophysiological
   niches of bacterioplankton populations.}},

Abstract = {{The biogeochemical cycling of elemental Hg has important effects on the
   global and regional mobility and reactivity of the metal, and has not
   been well characterized in coastal marine systems. Five sets of
   measurements examining the spatial/temporal distribution of dissolved
   gaseous Hg (DGM), total Hg (Hg-T), and reactive Hg (Hg,) in the waters
   of Long Island Sound (LIS) indicate that Hg degrees evasion is
   geochemically significant, and an estimated 35\% of the total annual Hg
   inputs to the system (average Aux: 342 pmol m(-2) d(-1) to the
   atmosphere, based on a gas exchange model). DGM concentrations ranged
   from 0.04 to 0.55 pM (81-1167\% saturation relative to atmospheric
   equilibrium), and show maxima in the surface mixed layer. Distinct
   seasonal patterns were observed, including higher DGM concentrations and
   percentage saturations during the warmer months. Seasonally averaged
   unfiltered Hg-T concentrations decreased by an order of magnitude from
   western LIS to the east, whereas the percent of unfiltered total as Hg-R
   increased from 14\% in the west to 71\% in the east. Relationships

Abstract = {{Carbon and nitrogen mineralization were determined along a transect from
   a mangrove forest to a seagrass meadow in the Bangrong area, Phuket
   Island, Thailand. Vertical sediment profiles of carbon oxidation were
   measured as sulfate reduction rates (SRR) using the S-35 technique and
   by monitoring net TCO2 and DOC production and Fe(III) reduction using
   anaerobic sediment incubations ('jar' technique). Nitrogen
   transformations were measured simultaneously as net NH4+ and DON
   production. In addition, total benthic metabolism and net nitrogen
   exchange were determined as fluxes of O-2, TCO2, DOC, and DIN (NO3- and
   NH4+) across the sediment-water interface. Rates of carbon and nitrogen
   transformations in this vascular-plant (high C:N)-dominated area were
   low compared with areas fuelled by detritus of marine origin (low C:N).
   It appears that the high content of structural biopolymers (e.g.
   lignocelluloses) hampers microbial activity. Suboxic respiration with
   Fe(III) as electron acceptor accounted for 70 to 80\% of the total
   carbon oxidation in the rooted mangrove forest sediment, whereas SRR and
   aerobic respiration were responsible for about 20 and <6\%, respectively
   The role of SRR decreased to about 10 \% and aerobic respiration
   increased to 45-65 \% in an adjacent bioturbated mudflat, while Fe(III)
   respiration decreased to 30-40 \%. At the sand flat and seagrass meadow
   outside the mangrove forest, Fe(III) respiration only accounted for 15
   and similar to 0\%, respectively, whereas SRR was responsible for 20 to
   45 \% of the total carbon oxidation. However, the most important
   electron acceptor in the area outside was oxygen (55 to 75 \%). The
   shift in dominance of electron accepters along the transect is primarily
   related to the presence of roots and infauna, but the sediment
   composition (e.g. grain size, organic content and iron content) is
   believed to be an important co-factor. The net production of ammonium in
   the sediment was not balanced by fluxes of DIN across the sediment-water
   interface. The missing nitrogen was assigned to a rapid and efficient
   bacterial ammonium assimilation at the sediment surface as indicated by
   ammonium turnover times of about 1 d.}},

Abstract = {{A bioenergetic model has been developed to examine growth kinetics
   associated with bacterial utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM),
   NH4+, and NO3-. A set of 11 metabolic reactions are used to govern the
   incorporation, oxidation, and N remineralization of DOM and dissolved
   inorganic N associated with bacterial growth. For each reaction, free
   energies and electron transfer requirements are calculated based on the
   C, H, O, and N composition of the substrates and their concentration in
   the environment. From these reactions, an optimization problem is
   constructed in which bacterial growth rate is maximized subject to
   constraints on energetics, electron balances, substrate uptake kinetics,
   and bacterial C:N ratio. The optimization approach provides more
   information on bacterial growth kinetics than do the Monod-type models
   that are typically used to describe bacterial growth. Simulations are
   ran to examine bacterial C yield and growth rate, N remineralization or
   immobilization, and substrate preferences as resource concentrations and
   compositions are varied. Results from the model agree well with
   observations in the literature, which indicate that the premise of the
   model, that bacteria allocate resources to maximize growth rate, may be
   an accurate overall description of bacterial growth. Simulations
   indicate that bacterial growth rate and yield are strongly correlated to
   the oxidation state of the labile DOM, as determined from its bulk
   elemental composition. Furthermore, the model demonstrates that
   bacterial growth cannot always be explained by a single constraint (such
   as the C:N ratio of substrate), since several constraints are often
   active simultaneously and continuously change with environmental
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The possible effects of eutrophication on benthic dynamics are discussed
   based on the Pearson-Rosenberg Model that describes the effects of
   organic enrichment on qualitative characteristics of benthic
   communities. Depending on the amount of organic matter reaching the
   sediments, the model describes three successive states: a) slight
   increases in biomass and few or no changes in species composition over
   the `'normal'' situation; b) strong increases of biomass and replacement
   of `'normal'' species by opportunistic species; c) disappearance of
   benthic animal species and azoic sediments. In the field, increase of
   benthic biomass and changes in species composition on decadal scales
   which are attributed to eutrophication have been documented in a few
   cases. Mesocosm studies tend to show much more rapid (weeks to months)
   but often incoherent responses after experimental nutrient and organic
   matter additions. The few studies of the `'opportunistic'' species that
   appear adapted to become the first recolonizers of azoic sediments show
   that there is no simple relationship between population characteristics
   and ability to colonize and that food quality and food requirements have
   to be better understood. The impact of benthic fauna on benthic-pelagic
   coupling (sedimentation, particle uptake), bioturbation, benthic
   mineralisation, nutrient and dissolved organic matter release in shallow
   water appears to be considerable and disappearance of fauna due to
   increased organic loading and/or anoxia events is bound to exert a
   significant influence on shallow water energy and matter cycles.}},

Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{170-184}},

Abstract = {{Absorption spectra and induced fluorescence excitation emission matrices
   of colored dissolved organic matter were measured in water samples
   collected along the Atlantic Meridional Transect in different
   bio-geographic provinces of the Atlantic Ocean from October to November
   2010. The highest values of CDOM absorption coefficient at 305 nm
   (a(CDOM)(305)), were recorded at the continental margins of the English
   Channel and Patagonian Shelf. The lowest values of a(CDOM)(305) were
   observed in the mixed layer of both North and South Atlantic subtropical
   oligotrophic gyres. The DOM composition was assessed using fluorescence
   spectroscopy, Excitation Emission Matrix spectra (EEMs) and the Parallel
   Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) model in addition to spectral indices
   calculated from CDOM absorption spectrum and EEMs. Six different
   components were identified in the EEMs by PARAFAC: Two components were
   similar to the humic-like fraction of DOM, associated with basin scale
   microbial mineralization processes. These components represent
   allochthonous DOM in the biogeographic provinces studied. One component
   of marine humic-like material of autochthonous origin was associated
   with DOM production from marine phytoplankton. Three components were
   associated with protein-like DOM. Two protein-like components had the
   spectral characteristics of pure tryptophan and tyrosine. There was a
   significant difference in DOM composition both between bio-geographical
   provinces and above and below the mixed layer. In the mixed layer in all
   provinces, except the waters of the Western European Shelf, the DOM was
   dominated by protein-like components. At the Western European Shelf, it
   was dominated by humic-like components. Fluorescence intensities of
   humic-like components were high at the Patagonian Shelf, but were up to
   40\% lower compared to northern hemisphere shelf waters. Humic-like
   components made a significant contribution to the DOM composition of the
   upper mesopelagic layer in all provinces, with the highest values at the
   Equatorial Upwelling Zone. There was a significant inverse relationship
   between humic-like components and salinity and temperature and a
   positive relationship with Apparent Oxygen Utilization. The humification
   index (HIX) was linearly correlated with the intensity of the humic-like
   DOM components. These trends suggest that the humic-like components are
   in dynamic equilibrium between likely microbial production in the deep
   ocean and photochemical degradation in the mixed layer. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We investigated the optical properties of surface water in areas of the

   occurrence of a phytoplankton plume. Results of absorption and
   fluorescence spectroscopy analyses and determination of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) concentration showed that the injection of riverine
   colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) strongly affected the optical
   properties and DOC concentrations over the shelf. Riverborne nutrients
   contributed to an increase hi primary productivity. However, during the
   study period, the increase in primary productivity did not result in the
   production of significant amounts of CDOM.
   Fluorescence spectroscopy results showed that optical properties of
   riverine CDOM were lost close to the mouth of the rivers. A simple
   mathematical model describing mixing between riverine and marine
   end-members demonstrated that most of the observed changes in optical
   properties of CDOM along salinity gradients can be explained by mixing.
   Laboratory mixing experiments between riverine water and seawater
   indicated that flocculation of organic matter during estuarine mixing
   did not affect the optical properties of CDOM.}},

Abstract = {{Linking microbial metabolomics and carbon sequestration in the ocean via
   refractory organic molecules has been hampered by the chemical
   complexity of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Here, using bioassay
   experiments and ultra-high resolution metabolic profiling, we
   demonstrate that marine bacteria rapidly utilize simple organic
   molecules and produce exometabolites of remarkable molecular and
   structural diversity. Bacterial DOM is similar in chemical composition
   and structural complexity to naturally occurring DOM in sea water. An
   appreciable fraction of bacterial DOM has molecular and structural
   properties that are consistent with those of refractory molecules in the
   ocean, indicating a dominant role for bacteria in shaping the refractory
   nature of marine DOM. The rapid production of chemically complex and
   persistent molecules from simple biochemicals demonstrates a positive
   feedback between primary production and refractory DOM formation. It
   appears that carbon sequestration in diverse and structurally complex
   dissolved molecules that persist in the environment is largely driven by
   bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of natural sunlight on heterotrophic marine
   bacterioplankton in short-term experiments. We used a single-cell level
   approach involving How cytometry combined with physiological probes and
   microautoradiography to determine sunlight effects on the activity and
   integrity of the cells. After 4 h of sunlight exposure, most bacterial
   cells maintained membrane integrity and viability as assessed by the
   simultaneous staining with propidium iodide and SYBR green I. In
   contrast, a significant inhibition of heterotrophic bacterial activity
   was detected, measured by 5-cyano-2,3 ditolyl tetrazolium chloride
   reduction and leucine incorporation. We applied microautoradiography
   combined with catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ
   hybridization to test the sensitivity of the different bacterial groups
   naturally occurring in the Northwestern Mediterranean to sunlight.
   Members of the Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes groups appeared to
   be highly resistant to solar radiation, with small changes in activity
   after exposure. On the contrary, Alphaproteobacteria bacteria were more
   sensitive to radiation as measured by the cell-specific incorporation of
   labeled amino acids, leucine, and ATE Within Alphaproteobacteria,
   bacteria belonging to the Roseobacter group showed higher resistance
   than members of the SAR11 cluster. The activity of Roseobacter was
   stimulated by exposure to photosynthetic available radiation compared to
   the dark treatment. Our results suggest that UV radiation can
   significantly affect the in situ single-cell activity of
   bacterioplankton and that naturally dominating phylogenetic bacterial
   groups have different sensitivity to natural levels of incident solar
   radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of the diffuse attenuation coefficient spectrum
   (K-d(z,t,lambda)), made as part of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux
   Study (JGOFS), Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS), show
   significant seasonal variations that do not covary with the patterns in
   chlorophyll a concentrations. The spectral structure of these changes
   indicates that the variations in optical properties are caused by
   detrital particulate and/or colored dissolved organic materials.
   Multiple regression analyses over wavelength are used to deconvolve this
   `'colored dissolved or detrital material'' (CDM) signal from the
   chlorophyll signal. Generally, CDM light attenuation is nearly as large
   as the chlorophyll-related attenuation and it exhibits a seasonal signal
   related to changes in mixed-layer depth. In the winter, values of CDM
   are roughly uniform throughout the upper 150 m of the mixed layer,
   whereas in the summer significantly reduced CDM values are found in a
   shallow mixed layer with elevated values in the seasonal pycnocline. The
   summer-time pattern appears to be caused by the combination of reduction
   of CDM within the mixed layer by photo-oxidation and its production at
   depth. This seasonal cycle is different than that observed for dissolved
   organic or particulate organic carbon at BATS. Hence, optical inferences
   of CDM are not directly related to biogeochemically relevant materials,
   such as dissolved organic carbon. Quantification of the photon flux
   absorbed by CDM can be used to assess the role of CDM quanta absorption
   in photochemical transformations. We suggest that CDM-regulated rates of
   photo-oxidation play a critical role in the regulation of near-surface
   dimethyl sulfide concentrations on a seasonal timescale. Last, the
   existence of a strong CDM signal requires modification of the techniques
   used to estimate chlorophyll from satellite ocean color sensors.

Title = {{Reactivity continuum of dissolved organic carbon decomposition in lake
   water}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{FEB 29}},
Abstract = {{We determined microbial decomposition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   over 3.7 year long dark bioassays of six Swedish lake waters. The
   overall lost DOC fraction was similar in clearwater lakes (34.8 +/-
   2.4\%) and in brownwater lakes (37.8 +/- 1.9\%). Reactivity continuum
   modeling revealed that the most labile DOC fraction, degrading at rates
   >0.01 d(-1), was larger in the clearwater lakes (11.1 +/- 1.2\%) than in
   the brownwater lakes (0.8 +/- 0.1\%). The initial apparent first-order
   decay coefficient k was fivefold larger in the clearwater lakes (0.0043
   +/- 0.0012 d(-1)) than in the brownwater lakes (0.0009 +/- 0.0003
   d(-1)). Over time, k decreased more steeply in the clearwater lakes than
   in the brownwater lakes, reaching the k of the brownwater lakes within 5
   months. Finally, k averaged 0.0001 d(-1) in both lake categories. In the
   brownwater lakes, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption
   decayed with an initial k twice as large (0.0018 +/- 0.0008 d(-1)) as
   that of DOC. The initial k was inversely correlated with initial
   specific UV absorption and CDOM absorption and positively correlated
   with initial tryptophan-like fluorescence as proxy for autochthonous
   DOC. Exposure to simulated sunlight at the end of the incubations caused
   loss of color in the clearwater lakes and loss of DOC in the brownwater
   lakes, where subsequent mineralization was also stimulated. The DOC lost
   in the absence of photochemical processes fell below previously reported
   watershed-scale losses in Sweden by 25\% at most. This suggests that a
   major part of the in situ DOC loss could potentially be attributed to
   dark reactions alone.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1615-1624}},
Abstract = {{With the accumulation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO(2)), a
   proceeding decline in seawater pH has been induced that is referred to
   as ocean acidification. The ocean's capacity for CO(2) storage is
   strongly affected by biological processes, whose feedback potential is
   difficult to evaluate. The main source of CO(2) in the ocean is the
   decomposition and subsequent respiration of organic molecules by
   heterotrophic bacteria. However, very little is known about potential
   effects of ocean acidification on bacterial degradation activity. This
   study reveals that the degradation of polysaccharides, a major component
   of marine organic matter, by bacterial extracellular enzymes was
   significantly accelerated during experimental simulation of ocean
   acidification. Results were obtained from pH perturbation experiments,
   where rates of extracellular alpha- and beta-glucosidase were measured
   and the loss of neutral and acidic sugars from phytoplankton-derived
   polysaccharides was determined. Our study suggests that a faster
   bacterial turnover of polysaccharides at lowered ocean pH has the
   potential to reduce carbon export and to enhance the respiratory CO(2)
   production in the future ocean.}},

Abstract = {{{[} 1] Riverine export of terrestrial organic carbon ( TOC) plays an
   important role in the global C cycle through influences on coastal
   productivity, sedimentary preservation, and CO2 efflux. In order to
   examine the influence of hydrologic variability and upland processes on
   TOC export from a midwestern agricultural watershed, we applied lignin
   phenol and stable carbon isotope analyses to assess quantity, source,
   and relative degradation state of TOC in soils, sediments, and
   size-fractioned aquatic OC from stream water. Flood conditions exported
   90 times more dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) than baseflow owing to
   increases in both discharge and concentration, indicating mobilization
   of additional DOC pools. These observations are supported by increased
   TOC contributions to aquatic OC during flooding. Furthermore, stable
   carbon isotope values show that OC exported during flooding is enriched
   in C-4-derived C by up to 38\% ( for high molecular weight DOC) with
   respect to baseflow, indicating different TOC sources are mobilized
   dependant on hydrologic conditions. Lignin phenols isolated from the
   colloid size fraction show progressive increases in the ratio of
   carboxylic acid to aldehyde functional groups ( a measure of relative
   degradation state) with distance downstream suggesting selective
   partitioning to mineral surfaces and/or degradation to this size
   fraction. This study shows that TOC quantity, source, and relative
   degradation state can change dependant on hydrologic conditions and
   in-stream transport in a small agricultural watershed. Moreover, these
   results are important in showing variability in TOC source and chemistry
   exported from headwater systems that might otherwise not be detected in
   studies of larger rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Two cruises were undertaken to study the nutrients and trace species and
   their relation to marine production in the Zhujiang (Pearl River)
   Estuary, which cover both wet (August-September, 1996) and dry
   (January-February, 1997) seasons. Concentrations of nutrients (NO3-,
   NH4+, PO43-, and dissolved SiO2) and other major and trace species
   (alkalinity, DOC and Al) in the Zhujiang are generally within the range
   of Chinese rivers and comparable to other large systems, like the
   Huanghe (Yellow River) and Changjiang (Yangtze River). In the estuary,
   some species (e.g. SiO2) illustrate a fairly defined relationship with
   chlorinity, whereas others show considerable remobilization and/or
   changes in freshwater end-members, owing to the fact that fresh water
   enters the South China Sea from eight channels with various water flow
   and different compositions. The incubation experiments using in situ
   water samples reveal that while phosphate is the limiting element in
   riverine effluent plume, the photosynthesis turns to be nitrogen and/or
   silicon limited further offshore on the shelf region. Trace species
   (e.g. Cu2+ and Fe2+) have important impact on the photosynthesis in the
   Zhujiang Estuary, with Fe2+ to be a more limiting element than Cu2+.
   Atmospheric wet deposition may well stimulate photosynthesis and hence
   demonstrate a potential link with algal blooms in this area. Atmospheric
   impact an the photosynthesis increases from estuary toward the interior
   of South China Sea. The experimental data further suggest that in the
   turbid region of the Zhujiang Estuary, radiation reduction by suspended
   materials could be an important issue limiting photosynthesis, although
   the eutrophication is quite common in coastal environments of China. (C)

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in anoxic marine sediments
   are controlled by at least three processes:  (1) production of
   nonvolatile dissolved compounds, such as peptides and amino acids,
   soluble saccharides, and fatty acids, via hydrolysis of particulate
   organic carbon (POC); (2) conversion of these compounds to volatile
   fatty acids and alcohols by fermentative bacteria, and (3) consumption
   of volatile fatty acids and alcohols by terminal bacteria, such as
   sulfate reducers and methanogens.  We monitored seasonal changes in
   concentration profiles of total DOC, nonacid-volatile (NAV) DOC, and
   acid-volatile (AV) DOC in anoxic sediment from Cape Lookout Bight, North
   Carolina, USA, in order to investigate the factors that control seasonal
   variations in rates of hydrolysis, fermentation, and terminal
   metabolism.  During the winter months, DOC concentrations increased
   continuously from 0.2 mM in the bottomwater to approximately 4 mM at a
   depth of 36 cm in the sediment column.  During the summer, a large DOC
   maximum developed between 5 and 20 cm, with peak concentrations
   approaching 10 mM.  The mid-depth summertime maximum was driven by
   increases in both NAV- and AV-DOC concentrations.  Net NAV-DOC reaction
   rates were estimated by a diagenetic model applied to NAV-DOC
   concentration profiles.  Depth-integrated production rates of NAV-DOC
   increased from February through July, suggesting that net rates of POC
   hydrolysis during this period are controlled by temperature.  Net
   consumption of NAV-DOC during the late summer and early fall suggests
   reduced gross NAV-DOC production rates, presumably due to a decline in
   the availability of labile POC.  A distinct subsurface peak in AV-DOC
   concentration developed during the late spring, when the sulfate
   depletion depth shoaled from 25 to 10 cm.  We hypothesize that the
   AV-DOC maximum results from a decline in consumption by sulfate-reducing
   bacteria (due to sulfate limitation) and a lag in the development of an
   active population of methanogenic bacteria.  A diagenetic model that
   incorporates a lag period in the sulfate reducer-methanogen transition
   successfully simulates the timing, magnitude, depth, and shape of the
   AV-DOC peak.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteroidetes are widespread in marine systems where they play a crucial
   role in organic matter degradation. Whole genome analysis of several
   strains has revealed a broad glycolytic and proteolytic potential. In
   this study, we used a targeted metagenomic approach to investigate the
   degradation capabilities of distinct Bacteroidetes clades from two
   contrasting regions of the North Atlantic Ocean, the Polar Biome (BPLR)
   and the North Atlantic Subtropical (NAST). We present here the analysis
   of 76 Bacteroidetes fosmids, of which 28 encode the 16S rRNA gene as
   phylogenetic marker, and their comparison to complete Bacteroidetes
   genomes. Almost all of the 16S rRNA harbouring fosmids belonged to
   clades that we previously identified in BPLR and NAST. The majority of
   sequenced fosmids could be assigned to Bacteroidetes affiliated with the
   class Flavobacteria. We also present novel genomic information on the
   classes Cytophagia and Sphingobacteria, suggesting a capability of the
   latter for attachment to algal surfaces. In our fosmid set we identified
   a larger potential for polysaccharide degradation and cell surface
   attachment in the phytoplankton-rich BPLR. Particularly, two
   flavobacterial fosmids, one affiliated with the genus Polaribacter,
   showed a whole armoury of enzymes that likely function in degradation of
   sulfated polysaccharides known to be major constituents of phytoplankton
   cell walls. Genes involved in protein and peptidoglycan degradation,
   although present in both fosmid sets, seemed to have a slight
   preponderance in NAST. This study provides support for the hypothesis of
   a distinct specialization among marine Bacteroidetes for the degradation
   of certain types of polymers.}},

Title = {{Net accumulation and flux of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved

Abstract = {{Marine mesocosms were manipulated with inorganic nutrients over a period
   of 22 d to investigate organic carbon partitioning under a variety of
   nutrient regimes. The chemical analyses and biotic measurements included
   inorganic nutrients, pigment signatures, particulate and dissolved
   organic species, bacterial production, and community respiration. The
   biodegradability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was investigated with
   in vitro decomposition experiments.
   The net particulate organic carbon (POC) production was 50\% of the
   total organic production during the initial 6 d of nutrient-replete
   growth and during a major diatom bloom. In all other situations the
   carbon partitioning was strongly in favor of DOC, which accounted for 82
   to 111\% of the total production. The production of new DOC preceded new
   DON by about 1 week. Thus, the new dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   initially had an infinite C:N ratio, which fell to 11-20 when DON
   started to accumulate. The highest C:N ratio was measured during a
   nutrient-replete diatom bloom. Dissolved polysaccharides accounted for
   50 to 70\% of the new DOC, and the lowest relative amount was produced
   during a diatom bloom. The chemical analyses unequivocally demonstrated
   that carbon partitioning in favor of carbon-rich DOM can take place
   during an active diatom bloom and not only during the decay of a bloom.
   The DOC-producing mechanisms cannot be fully identified. However, during
   the different growth phases the DOC production varied, as did the
   speciation of DOM with respect to the C:N ratios. When net production of
   dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was detected after 11 d, the DON
   production accounted for 25 to 50\% of the daily added and assimilated
   inorganic nitrogen. The measurements of community respiration made it
   possible to calculate the maximum carbon recycling by bacteria and
   bacterial net DOC assimilation. These calculations showed the estimates
   of carbon partitioning to be very sensitive to bacterial growth yield
   values and the factors used to convert leucine and thymidine isotope
   incorporation to bacterial production.
   Decomposition experiments showed that at least 35\% of the new DOC was
   biodegradable over 10-12 d and that inorganic nutrients only marginally
   affected use. The calculated turnover times of new DOC were between 15
   and 25 d. The semilabile nature of new DOC with respect to microbial
   attack is suggested as the main reason for the medium-term accumulation
   of new DOC.}},

Title = {{Amino acid and amino sugar yields and compositions as indicators of

Volume = {{40}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Microbial decomposition experiments were used to characterize changes in
   the amino acid and amino sugar yields and compositions of natural marine
   substrates during early diagenesis in seawater. On average, 63\% of
   added carbon and 68\% of added nitrogen were removed within the first 30
   days of decomposition. In all cases, amino acid utilization accounted
   for a substantial fraction of the removed C and N. Carbon-normalized
   amino acid yields decreased to less than 50\% of their starting values
   and most of this change occurred within the first 10 days of
   decomposition. Increases in the concentrations of amino sugars and
   decreases in the GIcN:GalN ratio in particulate organic matter (POM)
   illustrated the significance of microbial production during the
   decomposition of added substrates. Changes in the mol \% composition of
   amino acids during early diagenesis were substantial but highly variable
   with Substrate. Previous survey data collected from the same region were
   used in conjunction with the experimental data to investigate the
   utility of several established amino acid-based indices of organic
   matter diagenesis. This comparison showed that a combination of these
   degradation indexes is most effective for describing the diagenetic
   state of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Carbon-normalized amino acid
   yields were found to be the most effective indicator for early
   diagenesis. Relative abundances of amino acids were effective indicators
   of intermediate stages of diagenesis and the mol \% composition of the
   non-protein amino acid gamma-Aba (gamma-aminobutyric acid) was an
   effective indicator of advanced DOM diagenesis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Sulphate reduction rates (SRR) and nitrogen fixation rates (NFR)
   associated with isolated roots, rhizomes and sediment from the
   rhizosphere of the marine macrophytes Zostera noltii and Spartina
   maritima, and the presence and distribution of Bacteria on the roots and
   rhizomes, were investigated. Between 1 parts per thousand and 3 parts
   per thousand of the surface area of the roots and rhizomes of both
   macrophytes were colonized by Bacteria. Bacteria on the surfaces of S.
   maritima roots and rhizomes were evenly distributed, while the
   distribution of Bacteria on Z. noltii roots and rhizomes was patchy.
   Root- and rhizome-associated SRR and NFR were always higher than rates
   in the bulk sediment. in particular, nitrogen fixation associated with
   the roots and rhizomes was 41-65D-fold higher than in the bulk sediment.
   Despite the fact that sulphate reduction was elevated on roots and
   rhizomes compared with bulk sediment, the contribution of
   plant-associated sulphate reduction to overall sulphate reduction was
   small (less than or equal to 11\%). In contrast, nitrogen fixation
   associated with the roots and rhizomes accounted for 31\% and 91\% of
   the nitrogen fixed in the rhizosphere of Z. noltii and S. maritima
   respectively. In addition, plant-associated nitrogen fixation could
   supply 37-1613\% of the nitrogen needed by the sulphate-reducing
   community. Sucrose stimulated nitrogen fixation and sulphate reduction
   significantly in the root and rhizome compartments of both macrophytes,
   but not in the bulk sediment.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is one of the largest reservoirs
   of reduced carbon on Earth. In the dark ocean (4200 m), most of this
   carbon is refractory DOM. This refractory DOM, largely produced during
   microbial mineralization of organic matter, includes humic-like
   substances generated in situ and detectable by fluorescence
   spectroscopy. Here we show two biquitous humic-like fluorophores with
   turnover times of 435 +/- 41 and 610 +/- 55 years, which persist
   significantly longer than the similar to 350 years that the dark global
   ocean takes to renew. In parallel, decay of a tyrosine-like fluorophore
   with a turnover time of 379 +/- 103 years is also detected. We propose
   the use of DOM fluorescence to study the cycling of resistant DOM that
   is preserved at centennial timescales and could represent a mechanism of
   carbon sequestration (humic-like fraction) and the decaying DOM injected
   into the dark global ocean, where it decreases at centennial timescales
   (tyrosine-like fraction).}},

Abstract = {{The spectral absorption properties of chromophoric dissolved organic
   matter (CDOM) and their distributions in two Chinese estuaries, the
   Yangtze River Estuary and the Jiulong River Estuary, were studied during
   August 2003 (wet season) and during different seasons between 2003-2005,
   respectively. The CDOM concentrations (a(355)) of fresh end members in
   the Jiulong River Estuary varied seasonally, while its quality remained
   relatively stable. However, the a(355) of the marine end members
   exhibited less variability. Application of a conservative mixing model
   indicated that CDOM behaved conservatively in the Yangtze River Estuary.
   No photobleaching removal was observed at high salinity region of this
   estuary. Although CDOM showed conservative behavior for many cruises in
   the Jiulong River Estuary, there was evidence for removal in the low
   salinity regions during some cruises. Laboratory mixing experiments and
   a salt addition experiment suggested that particle sorption of CDOM
   maybe the possible reason for the removal. These results showed that
   absorption properties of CDOM can be used as a tool to observe the
   quantitative and qualitative dynamics of DOM during estuarine mixing.

Abstract = {{Interactions between phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria have been
   intensively studied, but many aspects of these interactions are still
   unknown because most of the studies were performed under non-axenic
   conditions. Therefore, we investigated the growth and release of
   dissolved organic matter of the marine diatom Thalassiosira rotula in
   axenic culture in comparison to T. rotula cultures inoculated with
   either a natural marine bacterial community (German Wadden Sea) or 3
   different bacterial isolates. The isolates affiliated to the Roseobacter
   group (HP50), Hyphomonas (HP48) and Flexibacteriaceae (HP49) and were
   previously obtained from a T. rotula culture inoculated with a natural
   marine bacterial community (German Wadden Sea). To test whether the
   availability of inorganic nutrients, vitamins and trace metals affects
   algal growth, organic matter release and interactions with heterotrophic
   bacteria., we performed experiments with either Guillard's f/2 or f/10
   medium, which differ in their inorganic nutrient, vitamin and trace
   metal concentration by a factor of 5. The bacterial community promoted
   growth of T. rotula in both media, as shown by the higher algal numbers
   relative to the axenic cultures, but also led to a rapid decline after
   the growth phase. Isolate HP50 promoted algal growth in the f/2 medium,
   but inhibited growth in the f/10 medium, whereas isolate HP48 showed the
   opposite patterns. Isolate HP49 prevented algal growth in both media. T.
   rotula exhibited distinct release patterns of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), dissolved amino acids, dissolved neutral carbohydrates,
   transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and protein-containing particles
   (Coumassie Blue-stainable particles, CSP), which were modulated by the
   bacteria added. TEP and CSP were produced by the growing alga only in
   the presence of bacteria, indicating that the bacterial modification of
   algal exudates and/or the bacterial decomposition of the alga are
   prerequisites for formation of these microparticles. Our results show
   that the presence of the bacterial community and of specific populations
   have distinct effects on the growth and organic matter release of T.
   rotula and presumably also on other algae.}},

Abstract = {{We used flow cytometry of autofluorescent and Syto13-stained marine
   bacteria and the uptake of tritiated leucine to assess the effects of
   different filter types on picoplankton abundance, community structure
   and bacterial activity in the filtrate. Coastal and oceanic samples from
   the NW and SW Mediterranean and the Atlantic coast of Galicia were
   size-fractionated using polycarbonate (PC), mixed cellulose esters (CE),
   aluminum oxide (IM) and glass fiber (GF) filters of 0.2 to 1.2 mu m
   nominal pore size from different brands. Flow cytometry of
   Syto13-stained marine bacteria and autofluorescent photosynthetic
   prokaryotes was used to analyze picoplankton abundance, size structure
   and community composition before and after filtration. We combined this
   capability with the detection of the changes in cell-specific
   heterotrophic activity in the filtrates. We found that the CE filters
   retained picoplankton better than the PC filters. The PC filters did not
   discriminate prokaryotes according to size as much as the GF and the CE
   filters did. In our hands the IM filters were no better than the CE
   filters. Bacterial activity in the filtrates increased in the PC and in
   the CE filtrates and this stimulation of bacterial activity was more
   important in the less productive environments. We conclude that care
   must be taken when PC filters are used for generating bacteria-free
   water, and that the use of CE 0.22 mu m filters is the best way of
   creating picoplankton-free water. However, the picoplankters that will
   go through the filters may encounter increased nutrient levels.}},

Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{62}},

Pages = {{45-64}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The molecular weight distribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in
   pore waters from estuarine and continental margin sediments was examined
   using ultrafiltration techniques. The majority of this pore water DOC
   (similar to 60-90\%) had a molecular weight less than 3 kDa. This
   percentage appeared to vary systematically among the different sediments
   studied and showed very slight changes with depth (upper similar to 30
   cm). The absolute concentration of this low molecular weight DOC
   (LMW-DOC) increased, along with total DOC, with depth in the sediments.
   LMW-DOC therefore represents the vast majority of the DOC that
   accumulated with depth in these sediment pore waters. These results have
   been examined in the context of a model which assumes that
   remineralization processes exert the primacy influence on the molecular
   weight distribution of DOC in the upper portions of the sediments. This
   model, in conjunction, with other recent studies of DOC in sediment pore
   waters and in the water column, suggests that there was preferential
   accumulation of refractory LMW-DOC in sediment pore waters. Abiotic
   condensation reactions (i.e., geopolymerization) appear to have
   secondary effects on the observed molecular weight distributions of pore
   water DOC, at least in the upper portions of the sediments examined
   here. Using this model to explain differences in the molecular weight
   distributions in these sediments suggests that organic matter
   remineralization in continental margin sediments may be controlled more
   by hydrolytic processes than it is in estuarine sediments, where
   fermentative or perhaps respiratory processes may exert a greater
   overall control on carbon remineralization. These observations provide
   further evidence that the extracellular hydrolysis of macromolecular
   (i.e., high molecular weight) organic matter may not always be the rate
   limiting step in organic matter degradation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

   The uptake capacity for the macromolecules was positively correlated to

Abstract = {{With the advent of ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (MS), recent
   studies have begun to resolve molecular relationships between
   terrestrial and aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in rivers,
   estuaries, mangrove swamps and their receiving oceans and lakes. Here,
   we extend ultrahigh resolution MS techniques to Lake Superior, the
   largest freshwater lake in the world by area. Solid-phase extracted
   samples from the western arm of the lake and its watershed, including
   swamp, creek, river, lake-river confluence and offshore lake sites were
   compared using electrospray ionization (ESI), Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance MS (FT-ICR-MS). Results were analyzed using cluster
   analysis and van Krevelen diagrams. Chemical similarity appears related
   to hydrological proximity, terrestrial impact and flow conditions. For
   example, higher and lower flow samples from the same stream differ from
   one another. Toivola Swamp, Lake Superior and the south shore river have
   diverse arrays of unique molecular formulae relative to the north shore
   river and stream sampled in the data set. The lake's unique elemental
   formulae, relative to its watershed samples, are primarily in the
   lignin-like and reduced hydrocarbon regions of van Krevelen diagrams.
   The ESI-amenable lake DOM also has a higher proportion of formulae
   containing nitrogen or sulfur relative to the other samples. The degree
   of overlap among formulae within the data set is consistent with
   previous ESI FT-ICR-MS characterization of terrestrial, estuarine and
   marine OM. There appears to be a conserved portion of formulae across
   natural OM samples, perhaps because these compounds are intrinsically
   refractory or because they are commonly generated as products of natural
   reworking processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Flows of the major biogeochemical elements (C, N, P, Si) and of
   transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) were traced during a bloom of a
   natural assemblage of marine diatoms in a mesocosm (l m(3)) to determine
   whether the exudation and subsequent gelation of carbon-rich
   phytoplankton exopolymers can account for the formation and potential
   export of carbon in excess of that predicted by Redfield ratios.
   Exponential growth of the phytoplankton community in the mesocosm
   extended for 10 d until nitrate concentration fell below detection and
   concentrations of dissolved inorganic and particulate organic nitrogen
   and phosphorus remained stable. Tight covariation of particulate organic
   elements occurred as long as nutrients were replete. But, after nitrate
   depletion, decoupling of carbon dynamics from that of nitrogen and
   phosphorus was observed, with a large flow of carbon into TEP An uptake
   of 72\% more dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) than inferred from nitrate
   supply and Redfield stoichiometry (referred to as carbon
   overconsumption) occurred during the study, largely during the postbloom
   phase, and was almost entirely traced to the particulate organic matter
   (POM) pool. Marine snow (aggregates >0.5 mm) appeared at the onset of
   nitrate depletion and coincided with rapid increase in TEP
   concentrations. Elemental composition of marine snow differed from the
   Redfield ratio by an enrichment in carbon and a depletion in phosphorus
   relative to nitrogen. It is suggested that sinking of TEP-rich marine
   snow could be a possible mechanism for export of carbon above
   calculations that are based on the Redfield stoichiometry.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterioplankton not only take up dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and
   convert it into biomass and CO2, but also release DOC into the water
   column. Because bacterioplankton represent the largest living surface in
   the world's oceans, and most intact bacterioplankton have a capsular
   envelope, we tested the hypothesis that most of the DOC released by
   bacterioplankton into the water column is derived from capsular
   material. Therefore, the bacterial uptake of radiolabeled glucose was
   differentiated between incorporation into intracellular and capsular
   pools to obtain production estimates for capsular material. Release of
   the radiolabeled material into ambient water was followed and its
   potential as a carbon source for bacterioplankton determined. Of the
   radiolabed organic carbon detected in bacterioplankton, similar to 55\%
   was incorporated into intracellular material and 45\% into capsular
   material. No significant difference was found between seawater cultures
   grown under P-limited and balanced nutrient conditions. After transfer
   of the radiolabeled bacteria into aged seawater, bacterial-derived,
   radiolabeled DOC was released into the ambient water at a rate of
   similar to 15 amol C cell(-1) h(-1), which corresponds to similar to
   25\% of the respired C. Incorporation and respiration rates of this
   bacterial-derived DOC by bacterioplankton were at least three orders of
   magnitude lower than the corresponding rates for glucose uptake.
   Incorporation of bacterial-derived DOC was only detectable when
   additional inorganic nutrients were added. Thus, we have evidence that
   bacterioplankton are constantly renewing parts of the capsule by
   releasing this material into ambient water. The release rate of capsular
   material represents similar to 25\% of the bacterial respiration rate
   and suggests that a considerable portion of the oceanic DOC pool should
   consist of ``semi-labile{''} bacterial-derived DOC.}},

Abstract = {{RECENT observations of abundant, nonliving, submicrometre particles in
   the upper ocean1-3 and new measurements of `dissolved' organic carbon4-7
   have fuelled speculation concerning the role of colloidal matter in
   ocean chemistry and biology. Colloids may act as reactive intermediates
   in the marine geochemistry of trace metals8-12, and a biologically
   labile pool of colloidal matter would affect models of ocean carbon
   cycling13-16. Here we report the use of naturally occurring Th-234 as an
   in situ tracer to estimate the residence time of colloidal matter in the
   surface waters near Bermuda. The Th-234 activity of colloidal matter
   (size range 10,000 nominal molecular weight to 0.2-mu-m) is similar to
   that of small particles (0.2-53-mu-m). Modelling of our results
   indicates a mean residence time of colloidal Th-234 with respect to
   aggregation into small particles of 10 days, which is roughly the same
   as for small-particle Th-234, yet a factor of approximately 6 less than
   for the dissolved pool. These results suggest that, more generally,
   macromolecular colloidal matter has a short residence time and hence a
   rapid turnover rate in the upper open ocean.}},

Abstract = {{In Arctic marine bacterial communities, members of the phylum
   Verrucomicrobia are consistently detected, although not typically
   abundant, in 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and pyrotag surveys of the
   marine water column and in sediments. In an Arctic fjord
   (Smeerenburgfjord) of Svalbard, members of the Verrucomicrobia, together
   with Flavobacteria and smaller proportions of Alpha- and
   Gammaproteobacteria, constituted the most frequently detected
   bacterioplankton community members in 16S rRNA gene-based clone library
   analyses of the water column. Parallel measurements in the water column
   of the activities of six endo-acting polysaccharide hydrolases showed
   that chondroitin sulfate, laminarin, and xylan hydrolysis accounted for
   most of the activity. Several Verrucomicrobia water column phylotypes
   were affiliated with previously sequenced, glycoside hydrolaserich
   genomes of individual Verrucomicrobia cells that bound fluorescently
   labeled laminarin and xylan and therefore constituted candidates for
   laminarin and xylan hydrolysis. In sediments, the bacterial community
   was dominated by different lineages of Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes,
   and Proteobacteria but also included members of multiple phylum-level
   lineages not observed in the water column. This community hydrolyzed
   laminarin, xylan, chondroitin sulfate, and three additional
   polysaccharide substrates at high rates. Comparisons with data from the
   same fjord in the previous summer showed that the bacterial community in
   Smeerenburgfjord changed in composition, most conspicuously in the
   changing detection frequency of Verrucomicrobia in the water column.
   Nonetheless, in both years the community hydrolyzed the same
   polysaccharide substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Seawater samples were collected monthly in surface waters (2 and 5m
   depths) of the Bay of Marseilles (northwestern Mediterranean Sea; 5
   degrees 17 ` 3 `' E, 43 degrees 14 ` 3 `' N) during one year from
   November 2007 to December 2008 and studied for total organic carbon
   (TOC) as well as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) optical
   properties (absorbance and fluorescence). The annual mean value of
   surface CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm {[}a(CDOM)(350)] was very
   low (0.10 +/- 0.02 m(-1)) in comparison to values usually found in
   coastal waters, and no significant seasonal trend in a(CDOM)(350) could
   be determined. By contrast, the spectral slope of CDOM absorption
   (S-CDOM) was significantly higher (0.023 +/- 0.003 nm(-1)) in summer
   than in fall and winter periods (0.017 +/- 0.002 nm-1), reflecting
   either CDOM photobleaching or production in surface waters during
   stratified sunny periods. The CDOM fluorescence, assessed through
   excitation emission matrices (EEMs), was dominated by protein-like
   component (peak T; 1.30-21.94 QSU) and marine humic-like component (peak
   M; 0.55-5.82 QSU), while terrestrial humic-like fluorescence (peak C;
   0.34-2.99 QSU) remained very low. This reflected a dominance of
   relatively fresh material from biological origin within the CDOM
   fluorescent pool. At the end of summer, surface CDOM fluorescence was
   very low and strongly blue shifted, reinforcing the hypothesis of CDOM
   photobleaching. Our results suggested that unusual Rhone River plume
   eastward intrusion events might reach Marseilles Bay within 2-3 days and
   induce local phytoplankton blooms and subsequent fluorescent CDOM
   production (peaks M and T) without adding terrestrial fluorescence
   signatures (peaks C and A). Besides Rhone River plumes, mixing events of
   the entire water column injected relative aged (peaks C and M) CDOM from
   the bottom into the surface and thus appeared also as an important
   source of CDOM in surface waters of the Marseilles Bay. Therefore, the
   assessment of CDOM optical properties, within the hydrological context,
   pointed out several biotic (in situ biological production, biological
   production within Rhone River plumes) and abiotic (photobleaching,
   mixing) factors controlling CDOM transport, production and removal in
   this highly urbanized coastal area.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{326}},
Pages = {{61-76}},
Abstract = {{This study addresses organic matter decomposition in permeable sediment
   of a sloping intertidal sand flat (German Wadden Sea) affected by
   current-induced pore water exchange and pore fluid drainage. Seasonal
   and spatial scales of aerobic and anaerobic mineralization were
   investigated at 2 sites, one near the water line and one on the upper
   flat. Hydrodynamic forcing during inundation caused deeper oxygen
   penetration through flushing of the uppermost sediment layer. This
   flushing resulted in higher areal oxygen consumption rates and lower
   depth integrated sulfate reduction rates in the submerged flat compared
   to the rates measured during exposure. Mineralization rates in the top
   15 cm of the sediment were similar between both study sites and ranged
   from 38 (winter) to 280 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) (summer), with sulfate
   reduction contributing 3 to 25\% to total mineralization, depending on
   the season. At the upper flat, these seasonal differences were reflected
   in the pore water concentrations of nutrients, dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Near the low water
   line, however, pore water nutrient and DIC concentrations were
   independent of the season and up to 15 times higher compared to the
   values recorded in the upper flat. The differences in concentrations of
   metabolic products between the 2 sites resulted from a low tide drainage
   extending deep below the uppermost flushed layer and causing seepage of
   pore water near the low water line. Mineralization and nutrient release
   in these permeable intertidal sediments is affected by 2 circulation
   processes that work on distinctly different temporal and spatial scales:
   (1) rapid `skin circulation' through the uppermost sediment layer during
   inundation that is characterized by short flow paths, low pore water
   residence time and immediate feedback to the ecosystem, and (2) slow
   `body circulation' through deeper sediment layers during low tide that
   is characterized by long flow paths and pore water residence times, and
   acts as a buffered nutrient source to the ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The direct photooxidation of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) may provide a significant sink for
   organic carbon in the ocean. To calculate the rate of this reaction on a
   global scale, it is essential to know its quantum yield, or
   photochemical efficiency. We have determined quantum yield spectra, OW,
   (moles DIC/mole photons absorbed) for 14 samples of seawater from
   environments ranging from a turbid, eutrophic bay to the Gulf Stream.
   The spectra vary among locations, but can be represented quite well by
   three pooled spectra for zones defined by location and salinity: inshore
   phi(lambda) = e(-(6.66 + 0.0285(lambda - 290))); coastal phi(lambda) =
   e-((6.36 + 0.0140(lambda - 290))); and ocean phi(lambda) = e(-(5.53 +
   0.00914(lambda - 290))). Production efficiency increases offshore, which
   suggests that the most highly absorbing and quickly faded terrestrial
   chromophores are not those directly responsible for DIC photoproduction.

Abstract = {{Laboratory and in situ experiments were performed in order to evaluate
   the role of W radiation on bacterial activity. Particular attention was
   given to the determination of the role of W-A and photosynthetic active
   radiation (PAR) and different nutrient conditions on the recovery of
   bacterial activity. Laboratory experiments with nearly natural radiation
   intensities indicated a 20 to 40\% reduction from the initial level of
   bacterial activity after W-B exposure for 2 to 4 h. Bacterial activity
   in freshly collected seawater showed a more pronounced inhibition and
   faster recovery than bacterial activity in aged, nutrient-depleted
   seawater. The results of in situ experiments with filtered water (0.8-mu
   m-pore-size filter) and natural surface solar radiation levels agreed
   with those of the laboratory experiments and revealed that W-A and PAR
   are important for the recovery of bacterial activity and result in
   levels of bacterial activity that are higher than those prior to
   exposure to full solar radiation. Bacterioplankton exposed to full solar
   radiation for 3 h and subsequently incubated at different depths within
   the upper mixed water column showed an increase in bacterial activity
   with increased depth; the highest bacterial activity was detected at
   depths of 5.5 to 10.5 m, where the short-wavelength W-B was already
   largely attenuated, but enough long wavelength W-A and short PAR were
   available to allow recovery, This elevated bacterial activity following
   exposure to UV-B was attributed to the photolysis of dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) exposed to near-surface radiation and to the rapid recovery
   of bacteria from UV stress once they were mixed into deeper layers of
   the upper mixed water column, where they efficiently utilize the
   photolytically cleaved DOM. It is concluded that studies on the role of
   W on the carbon and energy flux through the upper layer of the ocean
   should take into account the highly dynamic radiation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The integrity of the intracellular structures and the presence and

   snow-associated and marine free-living bacteria by transmission electron
   microscopy and special fixation techniques, Three categories depending
   on the presence of internal structures were differentiated, In marine
   snow, 51\% of the marine snow-associated bacterial community was
   considered intact, 26\% had a partly degraded internal structure, and
   23\% were empty with only the cell wall remaining, For the free-living
   bacterial community, 34\% were intact cells, 42\% exhibited damage, and
   24\% of the cells were lacking any internal structure, We also
   investigated the morphology and the extent of the bacterial capsular
   envelope. More than 95\% of all intact marine snow-associated bacteria
   were surrounded by a capsule while approximate to 55\% of empty marine
   snow-associated bacteria had no capsule, For free-living bacteria,
   approximate to 65\% of the intact cells had a capsule while approximate

   is a clear trend from intact cells which are commonly surrounded by a
   capsular envelope to empty bacteria for which only the cell wall is
   remaining, Since bacterioplankton represent the largest living surface
   in the ocean, it is concluded that the release of intracellular material
   from bacteria into the environment as well as the release of
   extracellular capsular material might fuel the dissolved organic matter
   pool of the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Data concerning concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic compounds
   (DOC) from marine and lacustrine environments are reviewed and
   discussed. Dissolved free amino acids and carbohydrates comprised the
   main fraction in the labile organic carbon pool. Dissolved free amino
   acids in marine waters varied between 3-1400 nM and those of freshwaters
   between 2.6-4124 nM. Dissolved free carbohydrates varied between
   0.4-5000 nM in marine systems and between 14-1111 nM in freshwaters. The
   turnover times of both substrate pools varied in marine waters between
   1.4 hours and 948 days and in freshwaters between 2 hours and 51 days.
   Measurements of stable C-12/13-ratio and C-14-isotope dating in ocean
   deep water samples revealed DOC turnover times between 2000-6000 years.
   Studies on carbon flows within the aquatic food webs revealed that about
   50\% of photosynthetically fixed carbon was channelled via DOC to the
   bacterioplankton. Excreted organic carbon varied between 1-70\% of
   photosynthetically fixed carbon in marine waters and between 1-99\% in
   freshwaters. The labile organic carbon pool represented only 10-30\% of
   the DOC. The majority (70-90\%) of the DOC was recalcitrant to microbial
   assimilation. Only 10-20\% of the DOC could be easily chemically
   identified. Most of the large bulk material represented dissolved humic
   matter and neither the chemical structure nor the ecological function of
   the DOC is as yet clearly understood.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal oceans link terrestrial and marine carbon cycles. Yet, carbon
   sources and sinks in these biomes remain poorly understood. Here, we
   explore the dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along the Amazon
   River-to-ocean continuum from the lower mainstem at Obidos to the open
   ocean of the western tropical North Atlantic. We molecularly
   characterized DOM via ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion
   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), determined DOM stable
   carbon isotopes, and interpreted the data in the context of bacterial
   abundance and production, phytoplankton biomass and composition.
   Multivariate analysis revealed that the DOM molecular variability in the
   plume was mainly influenced by the input of terrigenous DOM. Incubation
   experiments with water from close to the river mouth showed that photo-
   and bio-degradation preferentially removed C-13-depleted and
   C-13-enriched terrigenous DOM, respectively. However, there was no
   significant quantitative change in the total amount of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) over five days. This result suggests that most of the
   reactive DOM had already been bio-degraded upstream within the river and
   that photo-degradation was diminished in the turbid plume close to the
   river mouth. Terrigenous DOM therefore appeared to be relatively
   non-reactive nearshore. In the less turbid offshore plume, enhanced
   light penetration stimulated growth of phytoplankton and increased
   bacterial production. Although marine DOM compounds became relatively
   enriched, bulk DOC concentrations were 9 to 30\% below levels expected
   from conservative mixing of river and ocean endmembers suggesting that
   quantitative removal of terrigenous DOM was not compensated by marine
   DOM production. We propose that removal of terrigenous DOM in the outer
   plume may be enhanced by (i) bio-degradation primed by reactive algal
   DOM, (ii) photo-degradation, which may further break down DOM into more
   bio-available forms, and possibly (iii) sorption of DOM to sinking
   particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To assess removal efficiency of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the
   wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), fluorescence excitation emission
   matrices (EEM) with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and second
   derivative synchronous fluorescence (SDSF) were used for the
   characterization of DOM in wastewater. In A(2)/O process,
   tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like materials were removed to the much
   greater extent than that of fulvic-like. The protein-like material might
   be mostly decomposed by anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in
   anaerobic/anoxic and oxic zones. C1, C2, I-276, I-286, AP(1) and AP(2)
   were much better in tracing variations of tryptophan-like and
   tyrosine-like materials than C3, I-329 and AF(1) in tracing fulvic-like.
   The number of sampling sites should be reduced, as concentration
   variations of DOM components were subtle among sampling sites in the
   oxic zone and secondary sedimentation tank. SDSF may be a useful tool as
   PARAFAC to monitor removal efficiency of DOM fractions from wastewater
   in the WWTP. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria play an indispensable role in marine biogeochemistry by
   recycling dissolved organic matter. Motile species can exploit small,
   ephemeral solute patches through chemotaxis and thereby gain a fitness
   advantage over nonmotile competitors. This competition occurs in a
   turbulent environment, yet turbulence is generally considered
   inconsequential for bacterial uptake. In contrast, we show that
   turbulence affects uptake by stirring nutrient patches into networks of
   thin filaments that motile bacteria can readily exploit. We find that
   chemotactic motility is subject to a trade-off between the uptake
   benefit due to chemotaxis and the cost of locomotion, resulting in an
   optimal swimming speed. A second trade-off results from the competing
   effects of stirring and mixing and leads to the prediction that
   chemotaxis is optimally favored at intermediate turbulence intensities.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{397-409}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Data from several years of monthly samplings are combined with a 1-year
   detailed study of carbon flux through bacteria at a NW Mediterranean
   coastal site to delineate the bacterial role in carbon use and to assess
   whether environmental factors or bacterial assemblage composition
   affected the in situ rates of bacterial carbon processing. Leucine (Leu)
   uptake rates {[}as an estimate of bacterial heterotrophic production
   (BHP)] showed high interannual variability but, on average, lower values
   were found in winter (around 50 pM Leu(-1) h(-1)) as compared to summer
   (around 150 pM Leu(-1) h(-1)). Leu-to-carbon conversion factors ranged
   from 0.9 to 3.6 kgC mol Leu(-1), with generally higher values in winter.
   Leu uptake was only weakly correlated to temperature, and over a
   full-year cycle (in 2003), Leu uptake peaked concomitantly with winter
   chlorophyll a (Chl a) maxima, and in periods of high ectoenzyme
   activities in spring and summer. This suggests that both low molecular
   weight dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by phytoplankton, and
   high molecular weight DOM in periods of low Chl a, can enhance BHP.
   Bacterial respiration (BR, range 7-48 mu g C l(-1) d(-1)) was not
   correlated to BHP or temperature, but was significantly correlated to
   DOC concentration. Total bacterial carbon demand (BHP plus BR) was only
   met by dissolved organic carbon produced by phytoplankton during the
   winter period. We measured bacterial growth efficiencies by the
   short-term and the long-term methods and they ranged from 3 to 42\%,
   increasing during the phytoplankton blooms in winter (during the Chl a
   peaks), and in spring. Changes in bacterioplankton assemblage structure
   (as depicted by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting)
   were not coupled to changes in ecosystem functioning, at least in
   bacterial carbon use.}},

   dissolved organic matter (DOM). On the contrary, humic fluorescence
   consumption in the light minus dark incubations was positively
   correlated with the net production in the dark, indicating a rapid
   photodegradation of recently produced marine humic substances. Parallel
   incubation experiments demonstrated that daily photodegradation rates
   and residual humic fluorescence levels followed a seasonal pattern
   characterized by a marked autumn maximum. Finally, a significant linear
   correlation between the gross primary production (PLY) and the net
   production of aromatic amino acids fluorescence in the light pointed to
   the rapid consumption of dissolved protein-like materials at a net
   average rate of -1.4 +/- 0.2 ppb equivalents of tryptophan per day,
   which accumulates in the water column only when Pg exceeds 80 20 mu mol

Abstract = {{Predicting water-column phytoplankton biomass from near-surface
   measurements is a common approach in biological oceanography,
   particularly since the advent of satellite remote sensing of ocean color
   (OC). In the Arctic Ocean, deep subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCMs)
   that significantly contribute to primary production (PP) are often
   observed. These are neither detected by ocean color sensors nor
   accounted for in the primary production models applied to the Arctic
   Ocean. Here, we assemble a large database of pan-Arctic observations
   (i.e., 5206 stations) and develop an empirical model to estimate
   vertical chlorophyll a (Chl a) according to (1) the shelf-offshore
   gradient delimited by the 50m isobath, (2) seasonal variability along
   pre-bloom, post-bloom, and winter periods, and (3) regional differences
   across ten sub-Arctic and Arctic seas. Our detailed analysis of the
   dataset shows that, for the pre-bloom and winter periods, as well as for
   high surface Chl a concentration (Chl a(surf); 0.7-30 mgm(-3))
   throughout the open water period, the Chl a maximum is mainly located at
   or near the surface. Deep SCMs occur chiefly during the post-bloom
   period when Chl a(surf) is low (0-0.5 mg m(-3)). By applying our
   empirical model to annual Chl a(surf) time series, instead of the
   conventional method assuming vertically homogenous Chl a, we produce
   novel pan-Arctic PP estimates and associated uncertainties. Our results
   show that vertical variations in Chl a have a limited impact on annual
   depth-integrated PP. Small overestimates found when SCMs are shallow
   (i.e., pre-bloom, post-bloom > 0.7 mgm(-3), and the winter period)
   somehow compensate for the underestimates found when SCMs are deep
   (i.e., post-bloom < 0.5 mgm(-3)). SCMs are, however, important seasonal
   features with a substantial impact on depth-integrated PP estimates,
   especially when surface nitrate is exhausted in the Arctic Ocean and
   where highly stratified and oligotrophic conditions prevail.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterioplankton are the primary trophic conduit for dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) and linking community structure with DOC utilization is
   central to understanding global carbon cycling. We coupled stable
   isotope probing (SIP) with 16S rRNA pyrosequencing in dark seawater
   culture experiments on euphotic and mesopelagic communities from the
   Sargasso Sea. Parallel cultures were amended with equimolar quantities
   of four DO13C substrates to simultaneously evaluate community
   utilization and population-specific incorporation. Of the substrates
   tested two cyanobacterial products (exudates or lysates from a culture
   of Synechococcus) and two defined monosaccharides (glucose or gluconic
   acid) the cyanobacterial exudates were incorporated by the greatest
   diversity of oligotrophic bacterioplankton populations in surface
   waters, including taxa from > 10 major subclades within the
   Flavobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria
   (including SAR11). In contrast, the monosaccharide glucose was not
   incorporated by any taxa belonging to extant oligotrophic oceanic
   clades. Conversely, proteobacterial copiotrophs, which were rare in the
   ambient water (< 0.1\% of sequences), grew rapidly on all DOC amendments
   at both depths, but with different substrate preferences among lineages.
   We present a new analytical framework for using SIP to detect DOC
   incorporation across diverse oligotrophic bacterioplankton and discuss
   implications for the ecology of bacterialDOC interactions among
   populations of diverging trophic strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper synthesizes recent findings regarding microbial distributions
   and processes in the bathypelagic ocean (depth > 1000 m). Abundance,
   production and respiration of prokaryotes reflect supplies of
   particulate and dissolved organic matter to the bathypelagic zone.
   Better resolution of carbon fluxes mediated by deep microbes requires
   further testing on the validity of conversion factors. Archaea,
   especially marine Crenarchaeota Group I, are abundant in deep waters
   where they can fix dissolved inorganic carbon. Viruses appear to be
   important in the microbial loop in deep waters, displaying remarkably
   high virus to prokaryote abundance ratios in some oceanic regions.
   Sequencing of 18S rRNA genes revealed a tremendous diversity of
   small-sized protists in bathypelagic waters. Abundances of heterotrophic
   nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates decrease with depth more steeply than
   prokaryotes; nonetheless, data indicated that HNF consumed half of
   prokaryote production in the bathypelagic zone. Aggregates are important
   habitats for deep-water microbes, which produce more extracellular
   enzymes (on a per-cell basis) than surface communities. The theory of
   marine gel formation provides a framework to unravel complex
   interactions between microbes and organic polymers. Recent data on the
   effects of hydrostatic pressure on microbial activities indicate that
   bathypelagic microbial activity is generally higher under in situ
   pressure conditions than at atmospheric pressures. High-throughput
   sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed a remarkable diversity of Bacteria
   in the bathypelagic ocean. Metagenomics and comparative genomics of
   piezophiles reveal not only the high diversity of deep sea microbes but
   also specific functional attributes of these piezophilic microbes,
   interpreted as an adaptation to the deep water environment. Taken
   together, the data compiled on bathypelagic microbes indicate that,
   despite high-pressure and low-temperature conditions, microbes in the
   bathypelagic ocean dynamically interact with complex mixtures of organic
   matter, responding to changes in the ocean's biogeochemical state. (C)

Abstract = {{Access to bioavailable nitrogen often limits primary production in
   marine and freshwater ecosystems. Around 70\% of nitrogen transported by
   rivers worldwide consists of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), but its
   bioavailability has been poorly investigated. To assess the potential
   bacterial growth on DON, we developed a bioassay employing natural DON
   and bacterial inocula in medium manipulated to make N the limiting
   nutrient. We analyzed the bacterial utilization of the
   high-molecular-weight fraction of DON isolated by ultrafiltration from
   three wetlands in South Sweden throughout the year. The bioavailability
   of low-molecular-weight and bulk DON was also analyzed in one of the
   wetlands, where inorganic nitrogen concentration was sufficiently low
   and did not interfere with bioassays. The bioavailability of bulk DON in
   the latter wetland varied from 2\% to 16\%, suggesting that DON is an
   important nitrogen source for the biota of coastal waters. DON may be
   the dominant input of bioavailable nitrogen during summer, when nitrate
   concentrations in rivers decrease and DON bioavailability increases.
   Marine bacterioplankton assimilated a substantially larger fraction of
   DON than did freshwater bacterioplankton, on average by a factor of 2.4.
   This finding indicates that the susceptibility of DON to bacterial
   mineralization increases as it is transported from freshwaters into
   saline environments.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal hypoxia is an increasingly recognized environmental issue of
   global concern to both the scientific community and the general public.
   We assessed the relative contributions from marine and terrestrially
   sourced organic matter that were responsible for oxygen consumption in a
   well-studied seasonal coastal hypoxic zone, the East China Sea off the
   Changjiang Estuary. Our fieldwork was conducted in August 2011 during
   reinstatement of a subsurface hypoxia, when we observed a continuous
   decline of dissolved oxygen along with production of dissolved inorganic
   carbon resulting from organic carbon remineralization. On the basis of a
   three end-member mixing model and determinations of the stable isotopic
   compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)), the end
   product of particulate organic carbon (POC) degradation, we quantified
   the delta C-13 value of the remineralized organic carbon (delta
   C-13(OCx)), which was -18.5 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand. This isotopic
   composition was very similar to the delta C-13 of marine sourced POC
   produced in situ (-18.5 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand) rather than that of
   the terrestrially sourced POC (-24.4 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand). We
   concluded that marine sourced organic matter, formed by
   eutrophication-induced marine primary production, was the dominant
   oxygen consumer in the subsurface hypoxic zone in the East China Sea off
   the Changjiang Estuary.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of conflicting results have fueled a debate about how O-2
   affects organic matter (OM) degradation and carbon cycling. In a
   laboratory study, using both OM taken directly from a humic lake and
   chemically isolated fulvic acid, we monitored the mineralization of
   dissolved OM in freshwater under purely oxic and anoxic conditions,
   under oxic then anoxic conditions, and under anoxic then oxic
   conditions, for 426 d. Between 5\% and 24\% of the initial OM was
   mineralized, with most extensive mineralization occurring under purely
   oxic and anoxic-oxic conditions. A sequential change in the O-2 regime
   did not result in greater overall degradation, but initially anoxic
   conditions favored subsequent oxic mineralization. A substantially
   greater fraction of the OM was degraded than in previous shorter
   studies, with as much as 50\% of the total OM degradation occurring
   after 147 d into the experiment. Three fractions of the degradable OM
   were identified: OM degraded only under oxic conditions (68-78\%), OM
   degraded more rapidly under anoxic conditions than under oxic conditions
   (16-18\%), and OM degraded at equal rates under both oxic and anoxic
   conditions (6-14\%). The degradation patterns of natural dissolved OM
   from a humic lake and chemically isolated fulvic acid were very similar,
   which indicates a similar level of bioavailability. The difference
   between anoxic and oxic degradation was greater in our long-term studies
   than in previous short-term experiments, which indicates that the oxic
   and anoxic degradation potentials vary with increasing overall OM
   recalcitrance and that similar oxic and anoxic degradation rates can be
   expected in short-term experiments in which <30\% of the long-term
   degradable OM is allowed to decompose.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of photochemical O-2 uptake provides a measure of total
   chemical photooxidation of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Here we study
   this process and present estimates suggesting that photooxidation has
   the potential to significantly modify marine DOM pools, complementing or
   exceeding oxidation via coupled chemical-biological pathways. We
   measured apparent quantum yields (AQYs) of photobleaching, O-2 uptake,
   and H2O2 production in several coastal marine samples and in dilutions
   of a tropical estuarine water with oligotrophic seawater. O-2-loss AQYs
   varied little among samples or with dilution but decreased linearly from
   1.2 x 10(-3) at 300 nm to 0.3 x 10(-3) at 400 nm and dropped about
   threefold to near-constant values with increasing absorbed light dose.
   H2O2 production, about 45\% of O-2 uptake, showed similar dependencies,
   whereas singlet oxygen (O-2((1)Delta(g))) reactions contributed less
   than 1\% of O-2 uptake for typical coastal water. Implications of these
   findings for photochemical O-2, H2O2, and DOM cycling are discussed.
   Modeling the dose-dependence of O-2 loss and photobleaching at 310 nm
   required three DOM pools. In the simplest case, about 90\% is a weakly
   absorbing, low-AQY pool of DOM admired with two similar-sized pools of
   more photochemically reactive DOM. This result suggests that rigorously
   extrapolating laboratory data to the environment requires detailed
   mapping of dose-wavelength-photobleaching AQY surfaces.
   Action spectra and DOM flux estimates for coastal photooxidative
   chemistry were derived. Site-specific potential rates are comparable to
   available in situ data. Globally, the DOM photolysis capacity appears to
   be larger than estimated coastal DOM inputs, especially in tropical and
   temperate areas, including areas with maximal DOM inputs.}},

   source}},
Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{148}},

Abstract = {{Extensive data exist on the optical properties of CDOM from terrestrial
   and coastal environments, yet the open oceans have been historically
   under-sampled. Consequently, the source and structural basis of marine
   CDOM optical properties are still debated. To address this issue,
   detailed optical measurements were acquired for both untreated and
   sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduced natural waters and C18 extracts
   (C18-OM) across the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Except in regions of
   upwelling or in the vicinity of the Congo River outflow, CDOM absorption
   coefficients and visible emission intensity were far smaller for surface
   waters (a(CDOM)(355): 0.057-0.162 m(-1); lambda(ex) /lambda(em) =
   350/450 nm: 0.396-1.431 qse) than for waters below the mixed layer
   (a(CDOM)(355) 0.084-0.344 m(-1); lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 350/450 nm:
   0.903-3.226 qse), while spectral slopes were higher (surface: 0.019 to
   0.025 nm(-1); deep: 0.013 to 0.019 nm(-1)), consistent with
   photobleaching of CDOM in surface waters. Distinct emission bands were
   observed in the ultraviolet, primarily at excitation/emission
   wavelengths (lambda(ex)/lambda(em)) =280/320 nm, but also at
   lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 300/340, 300/405 and 320/380 nm for some
   stations and depths. In contrast, visible emission exhibited maxima that
   continuously redshifted with increasing lambda(ex) (>330 nm), a property
   characteristic of CDOM from estuarine and coastal environments. Further
   evidence that CDOM in the offshore waters of this region is composed of
   a major terrestrial component includes: 1) similar spectral dependencies
   of the emission maxima and fluorescence quantum yields; 2) a large
   Stokes shift in the emission maxima with short-wavelength excitation
   (lambda(ex) = 280 nm); 3) correlation of visible emission intensities
   with absorption at lambda(ex) = 280, 320 and 450 nm, with absorption to
   fluorescence ratios comparable to those found in estuarine and coastal
   environments; 4) affinity of C18 cartridges for the long wavelength
   (visible) absorbing and emitting material, but not the UV emitting
   material; 5) preferential loss of visible absorption and substantially
   enhanced blue-shifted emission in the visible following borohydride
   reduction of both the Equatorial Atlantic waters and the C18-OM of these
   waters. These results support the occurrence in offshore waters of a
   major terrestrial CDOM component that absorbs in the UV and visible and
   emits in the visible, as well as marine CDOM components that absorb and
   emit in the UV. The results further demonstrate that the simultaneous
   acquisition of complete spectral absorption and emission properties,
   combined with chemical tests (C-18 extractions, borohydride reduction)
   can provide a far clearer picture of the sources and cycling of CDOM
   within the oceans. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The discharge, composition, and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   and nutrients was investigated in two of the largest Arctic rivers,
   Yenisei and Ob, in order to assess their role for the biogeochemistry of
   the Kara Sea, and the potential of terrestrial DOM as tracer for the
   Arctic Ocean. Ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) from the two river-estuary
   systems was characterized by high C/N ratios (34-49), depleted
   delta(13)C values (<-26.5parts per thousand), depleted delta(15)N values
   (1.8-4.2parts per thousand), and enriched Delta(14)C values (84-307parts
   per thousand). The distribution of DOM and its chemical properties
   indicated no major loss processes during estuarine mixing but showed
   considerable variability between the rivers and years, suggesting a
   variable input of plankton-derived DOM. The input of plankton-derived
   DOM was reflected in elevated neutral sugar yields, decreased C/N
   ratios, but variable delta(13)C values. In contrast, delta(15)N values
   appear to be more reliable indicators to distinguish terrestrial from
   plankton-derived DOM in this estuarine system. Based on delta(15)N
   values, we estimate that between 6\% and 16\% of the DOM in the river
   and estuaries is of plankton origin. Clear differences were found in the
   chemical composition of DOM size fractions. Plankton-derived DOM was
   more abundant in the higher molecular weight fractions whereas
   terrestrial-derived DOM dominated the lower molecular weight fraction.
   This suggests a more heterogeneous origin of DOM than is revealed from
   looking at the composition of the bulk DOM. Photooxidation experiments
   indicated the potential photoreactivity of river DOM from those rivers.
   Compiling the information from this study with previous studies
   indicates that river input of DOM and nutrients is not the main driver
   of autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in the Kara Sea ecosystem.
   Consistent with previous reports, we found the terrestrial fraction of
   river DOM to be largely conservative in the estuaries underscoring the
   potential of terrestrial DOM as a tracer in the Arctic Ocean, especially
   when combined with standard hydrographic measurements. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Title = {{One Carbon Metabolism in SAR11 Pelagic Marine Bacteria}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{The SAR11 Alphaproteobacteria are the most abundant heterotrophs in the
   oceans and are believed to play a major role in mineralizing marine
   dissolved organic carbon. Their genomes are among the smallest known for
   free-living heterotrophic cells, raising questions about how they
   successfully utilize complex organic matter with a limited metabolic
   repertoire. Here we show that conserved genes in SAR11 subgroup Ia
   (Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique) genomes encode pathways for the
   oxidation of a variety of one-carbon compounds and methyl functional
   groups from methylated compounds. These pathways were predicted to
   produce energy by tetrahydrofolate (THF)-mediated oxidation, but not to
   support the net assimilation of biomass from C1 compounds. Measurements
   of cellular ATP content and the oxidation of C-14-labeled compounds to
   (CO2)-C-14 indicated that methanol, formaldehyde, methylamine, and
   methyl groups from glycine betaine (GBT), trimethylamine (TMA),
   trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)
   were oxidized by axenic cultures of the SAR11 strain Ca. P. ubique
   HTCC1062. Analyses of metagenomic data showed that genes for C1
   metabolism occur at a high frequency in natural SAR11 populations. In
   short term incubations, natural communities of Sargasso Sea microbial
   plankton expressed a potential for the oxidation of C-14-labeled
   formate, formaldehyde, methanol and TMAO that was similar to cultured
   SAR11 cells and, like cultured SAR11 cells, incorporated a much larger
   percentage of pyruvate and glucose (27-35\%) than of C1 compounds
   (2-6\%) into biomass. Collectively, these genomic, cellular and
   environmental data show a surprising capacity for demethylation and C1
   oxidation in SAR11 cultures and in natural microbial communities
   dominated by SAR11, and support the conclusion that C1 oxidation might
   be a significant conduit by which dissolved organic carbon is recycled
   to CO2 in the upper ocean.}},

Abstract = {{A combined solar photo-Fenton and biological treatment is proposed for
   the decontamination of a mixture of five commercial pesticides commonly
   used in intensive agriculture Vydate (10\% Oxamyl), Metomur (20\%
   Methomyl), Couraze (20\% Imidacloprid), Ditimur-40 (40\% Dimethoate) and
   Scala (40\% Pyrimethanil). Photo-Fenton experiments were conducted in a
   solar pilot reactor consisting of four compound parabolic collectors in
   which the pesticide mixture was treated at an original dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) concentration of 200 mg/L in the presence of Fe2+ or Fe3+
   concentration of 5, 20 and 55 mg/L Ferrous ions were marginally more
   active than ferric in terms of active ingredient degradation, which
   followed zero order kinetics, more so in the early reaction stages.
   Photo-Fenton was also far more effective (by at least two orders of
   magnitude) than the respective dark reaction under identical
   experimental conditions.
   Irradiation for 50-100 min (normalized at 30 W/m(2) light intensity) at
   20 mg/L Fe2+ was able to completely eliminate the active ingredients,
   and reduce DOC by about 15-50\% and COD by 40-70\%. respectively. At
   these conditions, ecotoxicity to the marine bacteria V. fischeri was
   substantially lessened, while aerobic biodegradability in tests with
   activated sludge was enhanced. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We use a new approach to characterize the absorption characteristics of
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in standard solutions and
   in several tropical lake ecosystems (Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika,
   Laguna Ibera). Compared with the common methods where a single slope of
   CDOM absorption spectrum is determined over a broad spectral region, we
   estimate the variations in spectral slope as a function of wavelength
   from 200 to 700 nm. Hence, our results show a distribution of spectral
   slope, referred to as the spectral slope curve, S-lambda, which was used
   to identify similarities between lakes and standard solutions as well as
   to show the wavelength intervals in which photodegradation modifies
   spectral slope. In contrast to the plethora of wavelength intervals and
   ratios presented in the CDOM literature, a comparison of spectral slope
   curves between ecosystems provides a potentially important tool to
   examine the characteristics of CDOM in a consistent manner.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of nM levels of dissolved dimethylsulfoniopropionate
   {[}DMSP(d)] in surface water samples from the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of
   Maine was accompanied by the accumulation of both dimethylsulfide (DMS)
   and methanethiol (MeSH). The mean net yields for DMS and MeSH, in terms
   of sulfur from DMSP, were 32\% (range 12-66\%) and 22\% (range 3-64\%),
   respectively. In six out of seventeen experiments, maximum net
   accumulations of MeSH were equivalent to, or greater than, those
   obtained for DMS. No relationship between net DMS and MeSH accumulations
   was found when all seventeen experiments were considered, Inhibition of
   DMSP(d) degradation with 50 mu M glycine betaine substantially lowered
   production of both MeSH and DMS, indicating that degradation of DMSP was
   required to produce these sulfur gases. The most likely route for MeSH
   formation is from demethiolation of 3-methiolpropionate (MMPA), a
   product of DMSP demethylation. Experimental additions of MMPA confirmed
   that MeSH could be produced from this compound. The MeSH produced from
   DMSP was rapidly lost in all water samples tested, much more rapidly
   than DMS. Direct determinations of MeSH loss rate constants showed these
   to fall in the range of 0.14-1.4 h(-1) in different water samples.
   Filtration of water through 0.2-mu m membrane filters resulted in a
   1.3-4.5-fold decrease in the whole water loss rate constants, suggesting
   biological or particle sinks for MeSH. Addition of Suwannee River humic
   acid accelerated the loss of MeSH from filtered water, suggesting a
   possible interaction between MeSH and DOM. The results of this study
   indicate that a substantial fraction of the DMSP(d) degraded in aerobic
   seawater is converted to MeSH. The diversion of DMSP-sulfur to MeSH
   represents an important biogeochemical control on the production of
   climatically active DMS. In addition, the production of highly reactive
   MeSH suggests that the degradation of DMSP may have a more important
   impact on the chemistry of marine surface waters than previously
   recognized.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to assess the
   transcriptomic response of the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis
   aeruginosa during growth with low levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen
   (low N), low levels of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (low P), and in
   the presence of high levels of high molecular weight dissolved organic
   matter (HMWDOM). Under low N, one third of the genome was differentially
   expressed, with significant increases in transcripts observed among
   genes within the nir operon, urea transport genes (urtBCDE), and amino
   acid transporters while significant decreases in transcripts were
   observed in genes related to photosynthesis. There was also a
   significant decrease in the transcription of the microcystin synthetase
   gene set under low N and a significant decrease in microcystin content
   per Microcystis cell demonstrating that N supply influences cellular
   toxicity. Under low P, 27\% of the genome was differentially expressed.
   The Pho regulon was induced leading to large increases in transcript
   levels of the alkaline phosphatase phoX, the Pst transport system
   (pstABC), and the sphX gene, and transcripts of multiple sulfate
   transporter were also significantly more abundant. While the
   transcriptional response to growth on HMWDOM was smaller (5-22\% of
   genes differentially expressed), transcripts of multiple genes
   specifically associated with the transport and degradation of organic
   compounds were significantly more abundant within HMWDOM treatments and
   thus may be recruited by Microcystis to utilize these substrates.
   Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive understanding of
   the nutritional physiology of this toxic, bloom-forming cyanobacterium
   and the role of N in controlling microcystin synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{The biogeochemical processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in
   inland waters is inherently related to its molecular structure and
   ecological function. Controlled bioassays are a valuable tool to analyze
   these relationships, but are seldom conducted and compared at temporal
   scales that typically prevail in natural inland waters. Here we
   incubated water from six boreal lakes in the dark and examined changes
   to the initial fluorescence and absorbance after 3.5 years. We
   identified five fluorescence components with parallel factor (PARAFAC)
   analysis (C-C, C-M, C-A, C-X and C-T) and found a consistent change in
   the relative intensity of two dominant PARAFAC components (increase in
   C-A:C-C, corresponding to Peak A:Peak C), commonly found in lake water,
   that represent terrestrially-derived DOM. Surprisingly, we only found
   minor changes to specific absorbance (SUVA), and did not find any
   changes to other spectral indexes including the fluorescence index,
   humification index and freshness index. By incorporating lakes spanning
   a wide range of initial total organic carbon concentrations (3.7 to 32.5
   mg L-1), water residence times, and spectral characteristics (e.g. SUVA
   1.13 to 3.77 L.mg C-1.m(-1)), we found that the relative intensities of
   two humic-like peaks were the most revealing of changes to DOM structure
   during dark incubations. We also verified that inner filter effects were
   adequately corrected within the concentration range of incubated
   samples. Thus, the processing of DOM under dark conditions, including
   microbial decomposition and flocculation, may have a greater influence
   on the humic-like peaks, particularly C-C (Peak C), with negligible
   changes to more commonly used spectral indexes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A bioanalytical test battery was used to monitor the removal efficiency
   of organic micropollutants during advanced wastewater treatment in the
   South Caboolture Water Reclamation Plant, Queensland, Australia. This
   plant treats effluent from a conventional sewage treatment plant for
   industrial water reuse The aqueous samples were enriched using
   solid-phase extraction to separate some organic micropollutants of
   interest from metals, nutrients and matrix components The bioassays were
   chosen to provide information on groups of chemicals with a common mode
   of toxic action Therefore they can be considered as sum indicators to
   detect certain relevant groups of chemicals, not as the most
   ecologically or human health relevant endpoints The baseline toxicity
   was quantified with the bioluminescence inhibition test using the marine
   bacterium Vibrio fischeri The specific modes of toxic action that were
   targeted with five additional bioassays included aspects of
   estrogenicity, dioxin-like activity, genotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and
   phytotoxicity While the accompanying publication discusses the treatment
   steps in more detail by drawing from the results of chemical analysis as
   well as the bioanalytical results, here we focus on the applicability
   and limitations of using bioassays for the purpose of determining the
   treatment efficacy of advanced water treatment and for water quality
   assessment in general Results are reported in toxic equivalent
   concentrations (TEQ), that is, the concentration of a reference compound
   required to elicit the same response as the unknown and unidentified
   mixture of micropollutants actually present TEQ proved to be useful and
   easily communicable despite some limitations and uncertainties in their
   derivation based on the mixture toxicity theory The results obtained
   were reproducible, robust and sensitive The TEQ in the influent ranged
   in the same order of magnitude as typically seen in effluents of
   conventional sewage treatment plants In the initial steps of the
   treatment chain, no significant degradation of micropollutants; was
   observed, and the high levels of dissolved organic carbon probably
   affected the outcome of the bioassays The steps of
   coagulation/flocculation/dissolved air flotation/sand filtration and
   ozonation decreased the effect based micropollutant burden significantly

Abstract = {{Studies on biogeochemical cycling of carbon in the Chilka Lake, Asia's
   largest brackish lagoon on the east coast of India, revealed, for the
   first time, strong seasonal and spatial variability associated with
   salinity distribution. The lake was studied twice during May 2005
   (premonsoon) and August 2005 (monsoon). It exchanges waters with the sea
   (Bay of Bengal) and several rivers open into the lake. The lake showed
   contrasting levels of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and organic
   carbon (DOC) in different seasons; DIC was higher by similar to 22\% and
   DOC was lower by similar to 36\% in premonsoon than in monsoon due to
   seasonal variations in their supply from rivers and in situ production/
   mineralisation. The DIC/ DOC ratios in the lake during monsoon were
   influenced by physical mixing of end member water masses and by intense
   respiration of organic carbon. A strong relationship between excess DIC
   and apparent oxygen utilisation showed significant control of biological
   processes over CO2 production in the lake. Surface partial pressure of
   CO2 (pCO(2)), calculated using pH - DIC couple according to Cai and Wang
   (Limnol and Oceanogr 43: 657 - 668, 1998), exhibited discernable
   gradients during monsoon through northern (1,033 - 6,522 mu atm),
   central (391 - 2,573 mu atm) and southern (102 - 718 mu atm) lake. The
   distribution pattern of pCO(2) in the lake seems to be governed by pCO2
   levels in rivers and their discharge rates, which were several folds
   higher during monsoon than premonsoon. The net CO2 efflux, based on gas
   transfer velocity parameterisation of Borges et al. (Limnol and Oceanogr
   49(5): 1630 - 1641, 2004), from entire lake during monsoon (141 mmolC
   m(-2) d(-1) equivalent to 2.64 GgC d(-1) at basin scale) was higher by
   44 times than during premonsoon (9.8 mmolC m(-2) d(-1) approximate to
   0.06 GgC d(-1)). 15\% of CO2 efflux from lake in monsoon was contributed
   by its supply from rivers and the rest was contributed by in situ
   heterotrophic activity. Based on oxygen and total carbon mass balance,
   net ecosystem production (NEP) of lake (- 308 mmolC m(-2) d(-1)
   approximate to - 3.77 GgC d(-1)) was found to be almost in consistent
   with the total riverine organic carbon trapped in the lake (229 mmolC
   m(-2) d(-1) approximate to 2.80 GgC d(-1)) suggesting that the strong
   heterotrophy in the lake is mainly responsible for elevated fluxes of
   CO2 during monsoon. Further, the pelagic net community production
   represented 92\% of NEP and benthic compartment plays only a minor role.
   This suggests that Chilka lake is an important region in biological
   transformation of organic carbon to inorganic carbon and its export to
   the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence and dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) were measured in the Lingdingyang Estuary, a major
   component of the Pearl River Delta, China, in May 2001 and November
   2002. Measurements of CDOM and DOC suggest multiple sources of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) in the low-salinity region of the estuary, due to
   the mixing of four freshwater outlets, Humen, Jiaomen, Honqimen and
   Hengmen, all with different freshwater endmembers and all flowing into
   the head of the Lingdingyang. Our 2002 cruise expanded efforts to
   characterize these four major outlets, allowing for the quantification
   of CDOM inputs within this complex watershed.
   DOC and CDOM appear conservative in mid-salinity (5-20) waters,
   suggesting that mixing dominates production and removal processes over
   time scales on the order of 3 days, the residence time of water in this
   region of the estuary. DOC and fluorescence are linearly correlated in
   the mid-salinity region of the estuary north of Shenzhen, suggesting
   that in this region, terrestrial inputs dominate both signals. However,
   this relationship does not continue out onto the shelf, where water
   masses of differing optical properties mix. The CDOM/DOC ratio decreases
   with increasing salinity as would be expected through phototrasformation
   of CDOM into non-fluorescent DOC. Additionally, this ratio at low
   salinity appears to vary seasonally, with a higher value in Spring (high
   flow) compared to Fall (low flow). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was sampled by tangential flow
   ultrafiltration from different basins in the central Arctic Ocean, the
   Greenland, Iceland and Norwegian (GIN) Seas, and the estuaries of the Ob
   and Yenisei Rivers. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged
   from more than 500 muM C in the rivers to about 50 muM C in the deep
   basins. Arctic Mediterranean Sea (AMS) surface water DOC concentrations
   ranged from 66 to 137 muM C. High concentrations in surface waters were
   due mainly to river discharge of terrigenous DOC, while elevated
   concentrations in AMS deep water likely reflect downwelling of DOM in
   this system. Total hydrolyzable neutral sugar concentrations were
   similar to7-fold higher in ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) from estuaries (1200
   nM) than in Arctic ocean surface waters (160 nM), but carbon-normalized
   neutral sugar yields (\% OC) were lower in the estuaries indicating that
   marine DOM sources were relatively rich in neutral sugars. Depth
   profiles of neutral sugar concentrations and carbon-normalized yields
   indicated that carbohydrates were produced and consumed largely in
   surface waters of the AMS. These observations were consistent with rapid
   bacterial degradation of neutral sugars during decomposition
   experiments. The molecular composition of neutral sugars was very
   similar among AMS surface samples and showed only minimal differences
   between terrestrial and marine UDOM, indicating that the neutral sugar
   composition is not useful for distinguishing these sources. It appears
   diagenetic processes rather than sources are primarily responsible for
   determining neutral sugar compositions in UDOM. Neutral sugar
   compositions in all of the UDOM samples analyzed in this study were
   indicative of heteropolysaccharides. The strong relationship between
   neutral sugars and the diagenetic state of DOM was best represented by
   neutral sugar yields (\% OC), which were used as a quantitative
   indicator for the amount of labile DOM in the AMS. Based on the low
   average neutral sugar yield (5.5\% OC) in UDOM from AMS surface waters,
   we estimated that only similar to2.2\% of the DOC was of labile nature.
   This value was lower than for surface waters of the Ross Sea and
   Atlantic and Pacific Oceans suggesting DOM is less bioavailable and the
   microbial loop is less active in AMS surface waters. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production by microbial populations was
   measured at 19 stations in the Atlantic Ocean to quantify the fraction
   of photoassimilated carbon that flows through the dissolved organic pool
   at basin scale and to assess the relationship between the percentage of
   DOC production, phytoplankton size structure, and rates of net community
   production. Experiments were conducted during four cruises carried out
   between May 1998 and October 1999, covering three upwelling regions:
   Benguela (SW Africa), Mauritania (NW Africa) and NW Spain, and the
   oligotrophic North Atlantic subtropical gyre between 30 degreesN and 36
   degreesN. Photic zone integrated particulate organic carbon (POC)
   production rates ranged from 10 to 1,178 mg C m(-2) h(-1), thus covering
   a wide productivity spectrum. The percentage of DOC production with
   respect to total integrated primary production ranged from 4 to 42\%.
   being larger in oligotrophic, picoplankton-dominated waters, where a
   balanced metabolism of the microbial community was observed, than in
   productive, net autotrophic waters, where large-sized cells formed the
   bulk of the phytoplankton biomass. A highly significant relationship was
   calculated between DOC and POC production rates in upwelling conditions.
   By contrast, the relationship between these variables in oligotrophic
   environments was weak, which suggests that different processes could be
   controlling the release of dissolved organic matter in productive and
   unproductive waters.}},

Abstract = {{A natural planktonic assemblage from the St. Lawrence Estuary was
   isolated in eight 1,500-liter outdoor mesocosms and subjected to
   combinations of fast or slow mixing regimes with natural solar radiation
   or natural solar radiation artificially enhanced with ultraviolet-B
   (UVB, 280-320 nm) radiation. The interdependent evolution of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC), absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic
   matter (CDOM), chlorophyll a (CN a), particulate organic carbon (POC),
   and bacterial abundance-in the mesocosms was followed over a 10-d
   period. There was a net increase of Chi a, POC, and DOC in all systems
   over time; however, the slower mixing treatments had less accumulation
   than the systems with faster mixing. All systems displayed weak
   correlations of DOC with POC and Chi a. A significant effect of enhanced
   WE radiation on concentrations of these bulk properties was not observed
   in any of the mesocosms. A strong correlation of CDOM absorbance loss
   (photobleaching) with absorbed radiation dose was observed in all
   treatments, with the fast mixing systems having larger absorbance losses
   and faster loss rates. Photobleaching was wavelength dependent,
   resulting in an increase in the spectral slope of CDOM absorption over
   time. Thus, although CDOM photobleaching may result in deeper
   penetration of light at all wavelengths, the ratios of UVB to
   ultraviolet-A (UVA) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) are
   reduced. The effect of enhanced UVB radiation was unexpected, with no
   proportional increases in CDOM photo-bleaching in the +UVB treatments.
   Comparisons of the different treatments indicate that interactions of
   biological activity, mixing, and the in situ light field can influence
   CDOM absorbance properties and/or photoreactivity and that there is a
   possible role for UVB in the production of CDOM.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal cycles of DOC and DON at Station E-I in the English Channel
   were investigated using an ecosystem model. Important features of the
   model are: (i) both carbon and nitrogen are incorporated by means of a
   set of varying C/N ratios; (ii) separate labile and semi-labile
   dissolved organic pools are distinguished; and (iii) there is a detailed
   treatment of processes associated with DOM production. The model yields
   a seasonality in DOM C/N ratios. Results suggest that the observed DOC
   increase of 34.4 mmol m(-3) is almost entirely due to a buildup of a
   semi-labile pool (turnover similar to 1\% per day), with phytoplankton
   excretion acting as a major contributary flux (with lesser additions via
   zooplankton messy feeding, detrital breakdown, bacterial lysis and
   phytoplankton mortality). The model indicates that the food supply from
   DOM via bacteria may provide up to 50\% of the needs of zooplankton at
   certain times of year, notably during the overwintering period. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas are among the marine regions most
   affected by climate change. Here we present the results of a diagnostic
   model used to assess the primary production (PP) trends over the
   1998-2010 period at pan-Arctic, regional and local (i.e. 9.28 km
   resolution) scales. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) above and
   below the sea surface was estimated using precomputed look-up tables of
   spectral irradiance, taking as input satellite-derived cloud optical
   thickness and cloud fraction parameters from the International Satellite
   Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and sea ice concentration from passive
   microwaves data. A spectrally resolved PP model, designed for optically
   complex waters, was then used to assess the PP trends at high spatial
   resolution. Results show that PP is rising at a rate of +2.8 TgC yr(-1)
   (or +14\% decade(-1)) in the circum-Arctic and +5.1 TgC yr(-1) when
   sub-Arctic seas are considered. In contrast, incident PAR above the sea
   surface (PAR(0+)) has significantly decreased over the whole Arctic and
   sub-Arctic Seas, except over the perennially sea-ice covered waters of
   the Central Arctic Ocean. This fading of PAR(0+) (-8\% decade(-1)) was
   caused by increasing cloudiness during summer. Meanwhile, PAR
   penetrating the ocean (PAR(0-)) increased only along the sea ice margin
   over the large Arctic continental shelf where sea ice concentration
   declined sharply since 1998. Overall, PAR(0-) slightly increased in the
   circum-Arctic (+3.4\% decade(-1)), while it decreased when considering
   both Arctic and sub-Arctic Seas (-3\% decade(-1)). We showed that rising
   phytoplankton biomass (i.e. chlorophyll a) normalized by the diffuse
   attenuation of photosynthetically usable radiation (PUR), accounted for
   a larger proportion of the rise in PP than did the increase in light
   availability due to sea-ice loss in several sectors, and particularly in
   perennially and seasonally open waters. Against a general backdrop of
   rising productivity over Arctic shelves, significant negative PP trends
   and the timing of phytoplankton spring-summer bloom were observed in
   regions known for their great biological importance such as the coastal
   polynyas of northern Greenland.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial abundance and H-3-thymidine incorporation were measured
   throughout the water column during September-October 1986, along
   transects in the north western Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman. Bacterial
   abundances and production estimated from incorporation rates were high
   (>1 x 10(9) cells l-1 and 30-92\% of primary production, respectively)
   along the oceanic portions of the transects. These elevated levels may
   indicate a response to the decline of summer phytoplankton blooms
   stimulated by monsoonal deepening of the mixed layer. Bacterial
   production and abundance profiles had complex vertical structure with
   multiple subsurface maxima related to chlorophyll and oxygen
   distributions. Production and abundance both declined exponentially with
   depth below 100-200 m. Rates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release
   from the sinking particle flux may have been adequate to support
   bacterial production in the Gulf of Oman, but in the open Arabian Sea
   this source appeared to be insufficient to meet the bacterial demand.
   The bacterial production estimates reported herein are very conservative
   because very low conversion factors were used. In general these results
   suggest that the carbon sources usually assumed to support bacterial
   production (e.g., phytoplankton exudation, particle breakdown) supply
   only a fraction of the bacterial demand in the northwest Indian Ocean.}},

Journal = {{ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{26-37}},

Abstract = {{Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important component
   in the aquatic environment and plays a key role in light attenuation and
   in carbon biogeochemical cycles. We examined CDOM production in each of
   two laboratory experiments in which phytoplankton and macrophyte
   degradation were monitored using absorption and excitation-emission
   matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEMs). During the incubation period,
   CDOM was produced from phytoplankton and macrophytes, and partly
   decomposed by microorganisms. The absorption spectra of the
   phytoplankton derived and the macrophyte derived CDOM were distinct and
   characterized by peaks and shoulders in the UV bands. Production of CDOM
   absorption at 350 nm, a(350), was 0.0125 m(2)/g per unit of chlorophyll
   a from phytoplankton CDOM from 0-3 d. Meanwhile a(350) production was
   2.708 x 10(-4) m(2)/g per unit of wet biomass from macrophytes CDOM from
   1-7 d. Despite the high production of CDOM by phytoplankton and
   macrophytes, extrapolation of these values to the field indicated that
   about 15\% of total CDOM was produced from phytoplankton during algal
   blooms in Meiliang Bay in summer and about 8\% of total CDOM was
   produced from macrophytes in the macrophyte dominated littorals. The
   mean value of the spectral slope (S) describing the exponential decrease
   of the absorption spectrum, which was strongly correlated to an optical
   index of molecular size, for the phytoplankton derived CDOM was 10.26
   +/- 2.05 mu m(-1), which was significantly lower than the mean S of
   14.47 +/- 2.88 mu m(-1) for the macrophyte derived CDOM (t-test, p <
   0.001). The mean value of the spectral slope ratio (S-R) for the
   phytoplankton derived CDOM was 1.79 +/- 0.52, which was significantly
   higher than that of 0.35 +/- 0.58 for the macrophyte derived CDOM
   (t-test, p < 0.001). Three fluorescent components were validated in
   parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) models calculated separately for
   phytoplankton derived and macrophyte derived CDOM, each CDOM source
   resulting in distinct excitation and emission maxima for each component.
   The significant differences in CDOM absorption spectra, S, S-R and
   PARAFAC fluorescence component characteristics, all showed that
   phytoplankton derived CDOM was compositionally distinct from macrophyte
   derived CDOM. Overall both sources were important to the CDOM pool in
   the shallow temperate lake. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{Viral infection of bacteria causes release of dissolved organic matter
   (DOM), which is available for bacterial uptake. In aquatic environments,
   this virus-mediated transformation of living cells into dissolved and
   colloidal organic matter may be a quantitatively important process in
   the pelagic recycling of carbon and nutrients, but little is known about
   the amount, composition, or bioavailability of viral lysates. By using a
   model system of a marine bacterium (Cellulphaga sp.) and a virus
   specific to this bacterium, the present study provides a first
   quantification Of the input of dissolved free and combined amino acids
   (DFAA and DCAA) and bacterial cell wall compounds following viral lysis.
   The DCAA constituted 51-86\% of the total virus-mediated organic carbon
   release of 1087-1825 mu g Cl-1 (estimated biomass of the lysed
   bacteria), whereas DFAA and glucosamine each accounted for 2-3\% of
   total lysate-C. The viral particles themselves constituted 4-6\% of the
   released organic carbon, and altogether. the applied analyses thus
   identified 53-92\% of the released lysates. Approximately 12\% of the
   Identified Compounds were derived from bacterial cell wall
   peptidoglycan, including various D-isomers of DFAA and DCAA, glucosamine
   and diaminopimelic acid (DAPA). Although a portion of this cell wall
   material may have entered the pool of refractory material, a significant
   fraction of some peptidoglycan-derived components, e.g. 83\% of the
   released D-DFAA, were removed from the dissolved phase during the last
   part of the incubations, suggesting that part of the cell wall material
   were utilized by the developing virus-resistant Cellulophaga Population.
   Therefore, we Suggest that virus-mediated DOM is a source of a variety
   of organic compounds, Which Contribute significantly to the pool of
   rapidly recycling material in the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was collected and
   concentrated using 1 kDa cutoff tangential flow filtration (TFF) from
   marine ( similar to 33 salinity), mid-estuarine ( similar to 15
   salinity), and freshwater (< 1 salinity) portions of the Chesapeake and
   San Francisco Bays. Natural bacterioplankton were also collected during
   the same transects on 0.22-mum pore size filters. TFF permeates from
   freshwater, mid-estuarine and marine stations were used to create a
   series of salinity samples ranging from 0 to 33 by increments of 3.
   Freshwater CDOM was added in the same proportion to each salinity sample
   to determine changes in spectral signals during simulated estuarine
   mixing. A series of incubations was conducted in which concentrated CDOM
   was added to TFF permeates (< 1 kDa, low fluorescence) in a
   nine-membered matrix such that each station's CDOM was added to each
   station's TFF permeate. Each incubation was then inoculated with a
   filter from its respective collection location. Subsamples from
   bacterial incubations were collected at various times and analyzed by
   high resolution three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission
   spectroscopy (EEMs) to determine if changes in ionic strength
   encountered during estuarine mixing affect the bioavailability and
   optical properties of CDOM. Five EEMs peaks were identified for each
   mixing experiment and microbial subsample; Ex(max): 330-350 nm/Em(max):
   420-480 nm, Ex(max): 250-260 nm/ Em(max): 380-480 mm, EX(max): 310-320
   nm/ E(max): 380-420 nm, Ex(max): 270-280 nm/Em(max): 300-320 nm,
   andEx(max): 270-280 nm/Em(max): 320-350 nm. These peak ratios were
   monitored over the time course of the experiment. Changes in several
   spectral properties during the simulated estuarine mixing were observed
   indicating CDOM conformational changes as it moves through the estuary.
   We hypothesized these changes may impact the biodegradability of CDOM as
   it moves from upland sources to the coastal ocean. Changes in DOC
   concentration during incubation indicated that allochthonous CDOM was a
   more utilizable substrate for estuarine and marine bacteria. There were
   also differences in peak ratios observed during incubation with
   allochthonous and autochthonous CDOM. There were Em(max) peak shifts
   dependent on the source of CDOM and bacteria, with more red shifting
   (toward higher wavelengths) in upper reaches of the estuary and more
   blue-shifting at the oceanic end-member. We conclude that bacterial
   degradation of specific components of autochthonous and allochthonous
   CDOM may impact the spectral characteristics observed throughout an
   estuary and that CDOM optical properties are partially a function of the
   CDOM's origin and mixing history. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), stable carbon isotopic (delta(13)C)
   compositions of DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC), and elemental
   C/N ratios of POC were measured for samples collected from the lower
   Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers and adjacent coastal waters in the
   northern Gulf of Mexico during the low flow season in June 2000 and high
   flow season in April 2001. These isotopic and C/N results combined with
   DOC measurements were used to assess the sources and transport of
   terrestrial organic matter from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers
   to the coastal region in the northern Gulf of Mexico. delta(13)C values
   of both POC (-23.8parts per thousand to -26.8parts per thousand) and DOC
   (-25.0parts per thousand to -29.0parts per thousand) carried by the two
   rivers were more depleted than the values measured for the samples
   collected in the offshore waters. Strong seasonal variations in
   delta(13)C distributions were observed for both POC and DOC in the
   surface waters of the region. Fresh water discharge and horizontal
   mixing played important roles in the distribution and transport of
   terrestrial POC and DOC offshore. Our results indicate that both POC and
   DOC exhibited non-conservative behavior during the mixing especially in
   the mid-salinity range. Based on a simple two end-member mixing model,
   the comparison of the measured DOC-delta(13)C with the calculated
   conservative isotopic mixing curve indicated that there was a
   significant in situ production of marine-derived DOC in the mid- to
   high-salinity waters consistent with our in situ chlorophyll-a
   measurements. Our DOC-delta(13)C data suggest that a removal of
   terrestrial DOC mainly occurred in the high-salinity (>25) waters during
   the mixing. Our study indicates that the mid- to high- (10-30) salinity
   range was the most dynamic zone for organic carbon transport and cycling
   in the Mississippi River estuary. Variability in isotopic and elemental
   compositions along with variability in DOC and POC concentrations
   suggest that autochthonous production, bacterial utilization, and
   photo-oxidation could all play important roles in regulating and
   removing terrestrial DOC in the northern Gulf of Mexico and further
   study of these individual processes is warranted. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Feeding and digestive strategies in deposit-feeding holothurians}},
Booktitle = {{OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 38}},
Series = {{Oceanography and Marine Biology}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{257-310}},
Abstract = {{Deposit-feeding holothurians employ a range of feeding and digestive
   strategies depending on the Particular environment to which they are
   adapted. Habitat and feeding specialisation is reflected in the
   tentacles, which show high diversity.
   Studies of tentacular ultrastructure in Aspidochirotida,
   Dendrochirotida, Apodida and Elasipodida have revealed a number of
   shared features. Tentacular layers include the mesothelium, which lines
   the ambulacral ducts, connective and neural tissues and the epithelial
   layer, which is covered by extracellular coats. Up to five cell types
   have been reported in the tentacle epithelium of the taxa studied.
   The capture of food particles involves contractile arid adhesive
   elements on the tentacle surface of dendritic, peltate and possibly
   other tentacle types and may involve selectivity, although the precise
   mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. Surface deposit-feeding
   holothurians show a high degree of dietary niche overlap on tropical
   reefs and in the deep sea. Where diverse suites of species coexist
   diversification probably results from trophic arid microhabitat
   specialisation.
   The digestive tract shows distinctive inter-ordinal and intra-ordinal
   differences in anatomy. The gut wall is layered and has ectodermal arid
   endodermal components. Epithelia in the pharynx, oesophagus, rectum and
   cloaca are characterised by T-shaped cells that are covered by a cuticle
   and are thought to be involved in the uptake of dissolved organic
   matter. Enterocytes, which characterise the intestine, lack a cuticle
   but have a filamentous coat and are involved in absorption and
   intracellular digestion, The role of subcuticular bacteria, evident in a
   number of studies. remains to be demonstrated.
   Deposit-feeding holothurians are broadly adapted to process large
   quantities of often nutrient-poor sediments from which they extract
   labile compounds. Some species may be able to utilise more refractory
   organic components of the sediment and bacteria may facilitate this
   utilisation.
   Shallow-water and abyssal deposit-feeding holothurians ha e broadly
   similar suites of enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of fatty acids,
   esters, glycosidic bonds and peptide bonds in terminal positions.
   Although deep-sea holothurians might be expected to be able to exploit
   refractory organic compounds, neither cellulase nor chitinase activity
   has yet been detected in the gut tissue of holothurians. However, the
   presence of cellobiase and chitobiase in the holothurian digestive tract
   suggests that they do have the potential to utilise the breakdown
   products of cellulose and chitin arid to digest bacterial membranes.
   Factors such as temperature, light intensity, food availability and
   physiological events affect ingestion rates arid gut residence tit-ties
   in deposit-feeding holothurians. The functional relationships between
   food quality, gut residence time and digestion reaction kinetics in
   detrivores, including holothurians, have been extensively modelled using
   chemical reactor theory. Deposit feeders should theoretically show
   plug-flow characteristics in which catalytic (enzymatic) digestion
   predominates and the majority of deposit-feeding holothurians probably
   conform to this model. Expanded regions of the gut can be modelled as
   mixing chambers that may facilitate enzymatic mixing of compact
   sediments or fermentation. Examples of taxa that have expanded gut
   chambers include molpadiids and the abyssal Psychropotes longicauda.
   The impact of holothurians on suspended and deposited particulates
   reflects feeding activities and lifestyles, Aspidochirotids and
   epibenthic apodids decrease the stability of the sediment Surface
   whereas dendrochirotids facilitate the accumulation of bound organic
   matter on the sediment surface, increasing stability and decreasing
   permeability of sediment. Burrowing deposit-feeding holothurians
   increase the vertical heterogeneity of the the sediment profile.
   Molpadiids and burrowing apodids make the micro- and mesorelief of the
   sea bottom more complicated, which may have either positive or negative
   effects on sediment stability.
   Variations in surface primary and detrital production influence the
   proportions of the major holothurian taxa and consequently their impact
   at different latitudes. In tropical and subtropical regions, where
   Aspidochirotida and epibenthic Apodida predominate, the major impact of
   holothurians is horizontal transport of surface sediments. In temperate
   regions. Dendrochirotida. Molpadiida and burrowing Apodida predominate.
   These taxa have major and diverse effects on the sediment surface, where
   they cause biodeposition and horizontal sediment transport, and in
   deeper sediments A here they cause bioturbation. In polar regions, the
   major impact of holothurians is through biosedimentation: horizontal
   transfer of sediments is absent, In the deep sea. suspension feeders are
   generally rare and the distribution of deposit feeders is influenced
   greatly by surface production. In eutrophic sites relatively high
   densities of surface deposit-feeding holothurians cause rapid lateral
   transfer and redistribution of material as it arrives on the sea floor.
   In oligotrophic sites, surface deposit-feeding holothurians are less
   common and their contribution to lateral sediment transfer is
   negligible.}},

Abstract = {{It has recently been shown that marine bacterioplankton release copious
   amounts of capsular material as `semi-labile' to `refractory' dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) into the ambient water. The fate of this
   bacterioplankton-derived DOC remains largely unknown. Here we
   investigate the capability of this bacterial-derived capsular DOC to
   coagulate to exopolymer particles under contrasting turbulence regimes.
   Under high turbulence, fewer but larger particles (>2 mu m in diameter)
   were detected, while the total exopolymer particle-mass (>0.2 mu m) was
   higher under stagnant conditions. Under stagnant conditions most of the
   bacterial-derived particles remained in the size-class between 0.2 and 2
   mu m. The production rate of exopolymer particles was estimated to
   amount to about 4 amol C cell(-1) h(-1), representing about 25\% of the
   previously estimated bacterioplankton DOC release of about 15 amol C
   cell(-1) h(-1). Considering that bacterioplankton represent the largest
   living surface in the ocean, the release and subsequent coagulation of
   bacteriopIankton-derived capsular DOC might be an important. thus far

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) were
   measured during early austral Spring 1992 at a number of stations along
   the 6 degrees W meridian between 47 degrees and 60 degrees S. This
   included the Polar Front in the north, the zone of melting sea-ice in
   the south, and waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in between.
   Concentrations of DOC were low in deep water (34-38 mu M) With generally
   similar or slightly higher values in the surface mixed layer (38-55 mu
   M). DOC:DON ratios are wider in surface water than in deep water, i.e.
   surface accumulations contain relatively C-rich dissolved organic
   matter. The highly variable distribution of the surface DOC was not
   related to hydrographic or biotic features (fronts, plankton
   development) indicating the lability and transient occurrence of this
   material.
   Growth rates of bacteria were determined in subsamples from 51 0.8-mu
   m-filtered batches of seawater incubated in the dark at in-situ
   temperature. Thymidine and leucine uptake and bacterial biomass change
   as well as changes in dissolved organic carbon in the batches, and
   oxygen consumption in parallel incubations correlated linearly over 2
   weeks of incubation which allowed extrapolation to in-situ conditions.
   Bacterial growth in these experiments depended strongly on the amount of
   initial DOG. Growth in water from greater depth (1000 m) containing 38
   mu M DOG was minimal, as were DOG-decrease and oxygen consumption.
   Higher rates were observed in surface water slightly enriched with DOG,
   and highest rates in surface water amended with DOG-rich melted sea ice.
   Bacterial growth efficiencies (biomass C-increase vs DOC consumed) were
   about 30\%. The experiments showed that at least 40-60\% of the DOC in
   excess of deep water concentrations was available to bacteria. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Although halogen radicals are recognized to form as products of hydroxyl
   radical ((OH)-O-center dot) scavenging by halides, their contribution to
   the phototransformation of marine organic compounds has received little

   seawater halides can increase photodegradation rates of domoic acid, a
   marine algal toxin, and dimethyl sulfide, a volatile precursor to cloud
   condensation nuclei, up to fivefold. Using synthetic seawater solutions,
   we show that the increased photodegradation is specific to dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) and halides, rather than other seawater salt
   constituents (e. g., carbonates) or photoactive species (e. g., iron and
   nitrate). Experiments in synthetic and natural coastal and estuarine
   water samples demonstrate that the halide-specific increase in
   photodegradation could be attributed to photochemically generated
   halogen radicals rather than other photoproduced reactive intermediates
   {[}e. g., excited-state triplet DOM ((DOM)-D-3{*}), reactive oxygen
   species]. Computational kinetic modeling indicates that seawater halogen
   radical concentrations are two to three orders ofmagnitude greater than
   freshwater (OH)-O-center dot concentrations and sufficient to account
   for the observed halide-specific increase in photodegradation. Dark
   (OH)-O-center dot generation by gamma radiolysis demonstrates that
   halogen radical production via (OH)-O-center dot scavenging by halides
   is insufficient to explain the observed effect. Using sensitizer models
   for DOM chromophores, we show that halogen radicals are formed
   predominantly by direct oxidation of Cl-and Br- by (DOM)-D-3{*}, an
   (OH)-O-center dot-independent pathway. Our results indicate that halogen
   radicals significantly contribute to the phototransformation of algal
   products in coastal or estuarine surface waters.}},

Abstract = {{The Deepwater Horizon oil spill triggered a complex cascade of microbial
   responses that reshaped the dynamics of heterotrophic carbon degradation
   and the turnover of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in oil contaminated
   waters. Our results from 21-day laboratory incubations in rotating glass
   bottles (roller bottles) demonstrate that microbial dynamics and carbon
   flux in oil-contaminated surface water sampled near the spill site two
   weeks after the onset of the blowout were greatly affected by activities
   of microbes associated with macroscopic oil aggregates. Roller bottles
   with oil-amended water showed rapid formation of oil aggregates that
   were similar in size and appearance compared to oil aggregates observed
   in surface waters near the spill site. Oil aggregates that formed in
   roller bottles were densely colonized by heterotrophic bacteria,
   exhibiting high rates of enzymatic activity (lipase hydrolysis)
   indicative of oil degradation. Ambient waters surrounding aggregates
   also showed enhanced microbial activities not directly associated with
   primary oil-degradation (beta-glucosidase; peptidase), as well as a
   twofold increase in DOC. Concurrent changes in fluorescence properties
   of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) suggest an increase in
   oil-derived, aromatic hydrocarbons in the DOC pool. Thus our data
   indicate that oil aggregates mediate, by two distinct mechanisms, the
   transfer of hydrocarbons to the deep sea: a microbially-derived flux of
   oil-derived DOC from sinking oil aggregates into the ambient water
   column, and rapid sedimentation of the oil aggregates themselves,
   serving as vehicles for oily particulate matter as well as oil
   aggregate-associated microbial communities.}},

Abstract = {{We have determined the seasonal (July 2001-July 2002) and vertical
   variability in the photosynthetic production of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOCp) and particulate organic carbon (POCp) in a coastal upwelling
   ecosystem (Ria de Vigo, Northwest Spain), together with the relationship
   between irradiance and DOCp and the time-course of DOCp over 24-h
   periods. Euphotic layer-integrated rates of DOCp and POCp ranged between
   5 and 190 mg C m(-2) h(-1) and between 40 and 1,130 mg C m(-2) h(-1),
   respectively. Irradiance was the most important variable affecting the
   vertical variability of the percentage of extracellular release {[}PER,
   defined as DOCp/(DOCp + POCp)]. Whereas POCp decreased markedly below
   the surface, DOCp remained constant or even increased, thus causing a
   sharp increase in PER with depth. Biomass-specific rates of DOC
   production also increased with depth. These observations were confirmed
   by the results of photosynthesis-irradiance experiments, which
   consistently showed highest DOCp and PER values at subsaturating
   irradiances. Our results argue against the view that the release of DOC
   is an overflow mechanism occurring preferentially under conditions of
   high irradiance and low nutrient concentration. PER was uncorrelated
   with the size structure of phytoplankton biomass and productivity, and
   >80\% of the variability in integrated DOCp was explained by POCp. These
   findings indicate that the relative importance of dissolved primary
   production was independent of the dominant type of planktonic trophic
   organization. Moreover, production of DOC stopped at night, which
   strongly indicates that trophic processes were not involved in the
   release of dissolved photosynthate. Our data support a purely
   physiological mechanism of passive DOC release by normally growing
   cells, which is enhanced under suboptimal irradiances but proceeds at a
   similar biomass-specific rate throughout the year. On an integrated
   basis, PER averaged 19 +/- 1\%, thus indicating that even in eutrophic
   waters, total primary productivity can be significantly underestimated
   if the dissolved products of photosynthesis are not taken into account.}},

   the lignin-rich humic substances more slowly and less efficiently than
   other components of the DOC pool. a significant fraction (24\%) of these

   plant biomarkers (lignin phenols) indicate that 11-75\% of the dissolved
   humic substances on the southeastern U.S. continental shelf is from
   vascular plant-dominated environments, Calculations indicate that about
   half this material is contributed by the coastal salt marshes and half

Abstract = {{Most marine sponges establish a persistent association with a wide array
   of phylogenetically and physiologically diverse microbes. To date, the
   role of these symbiotic microbial communities in the metabolism and
   nutrient cycles of the sponge-microbe consortium remains largely
   unknown. We identified and quantified the microbial communities
   associated with three common Mediterranean sponge species, Dysidea
   avara, Agelas oroides and Chondrosia reniformis (Demospongiae) that
   cohabitate coralligenous community. For each sponge we quantified the
   uptake and release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON),
   inorganic nitrogen and phosphate. Low microbial abundance and no
   evidence for DOC uptake or nitrification were found for D. avara. In
   contrast A. oroides and C. reniformis showed high microbial abundance
   (30\% and 70\% of their tissue occupied by microbes respectively) and
   both species exhibited high nitrification and high DOC and NH4+ uptake.
   Surprisingly, these unique metabolic pathways were mediated in each
   sponge species by a different, and host specific, microbial community.
   The functional convergence of microbial consortia found in these two
   sympatric sponge species, suggest that these metabolic processes may be
   of special relevance to the success of the holobiont.}},

Abstract = {{Several lines of evidence indicate that microorganisms in the meso-and
   bathypelagic ocean are metabolically active and respiring carbon. In
   addition, growing evidence suggests that archaea are fixing inorganic
   carbon in this environment. However, direct quantification of the
   contribution from deep ocean carbon sources to community production in
   the dark ocean remains a challenge. In this study, carbon flow through
   the microbial community at 2 depths in the mesopelagic zone of the North
   Pacific Subtropical Gyre was examined by exploiting the unique
   radiocarbon signatures (Delta C-14) of the 3 major carbon sources in
   this environment. The radiocarbon content of nucleic acids, a biomarker
   for viable cells, isolated from size-fractionated particles (0.2-0.5 mu
   m and >0.5 mu m) showed the direct incorporation of carbon delivered by
   rapidly sinking particles. Most significantly, at the 2 mesopelagic
   depths examined (670 m and 915 m), carbon derived from in situ
   autotrophic fixation supported a significant fraction of the free-living
   microbial community (0.2-0.5 mu m size fraction), but the contribution
   of chemoautotrophy varied markedly between the 2 depths. Results further
   showed that utilization of the ocean's largest reduced carbon reservoir,
   C-14-depleted, dissolved organic carbon, was negligible in this
   environment. This isotopic portrait of carbon assimilation by the in
   situ, free-living microbial community, integrated over > 50,000 L of
   seawater, implies that recent, photosynthetic carbon is not always the
   major carbon source supporting microbial community production in the
   mesopelagic realm.}},

Abstract = {{Glass sponges are conspicuous inhabitants of benthic communities in the
   cool waters of the Antarctic and north Pacific continental shelf. We
   used an ROV outfitted with a new device for simultaneous sampling of
   water inhaled and exhaled by the sponges to provide the first data on
   the nutritional ecology and metabolism of two glass sponge species in
   their natural deep-water habitat (120-160 m). Aphrocallistes vastus and
   Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni were found to be mostly bacteriovores, removing
   up to 95\% of the bacteria (median removal was 79\% for both species)
   and heterotrophic protists (< 10 mu m) from the water they filter. The
   relatively scarce microbial cells were efficiently selected from a
   `soup' of suspended clay and detritus particles (microorganisms
   accounted for similar to 1\% of the total ambient suspended solids).
   Removal of planktonic microorganisms (2.2 +/- 1.3 mu mol carbon {[}C] C
   L-1 and 0.37 +/- 0.17 mu mol nitrogen {[}N] L-1) accounted for the
   entire total organic C uptake and ammonium excretion by both species,
   with no evidence for dissolved organic uptake. Similar results were
   obtained in laboratory experiments in which dissolved organic C was
   directly measured. Despite the massive siliceous sponge skeleton, silica
   uptake was below detection levels (0.28 mu mol L-1), supporting previous
   suggestions of low growth rates in Hexactinellida. Reported mean sponge
   abundances of > 1 individual m(-2) indicate that the sponge filtering
   activity may significantly affect the deep microbial community and
   benthic-pelagic mass exchange in some northeast Pacific fjords.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter is important in translocation and export of

   process is less well understood. We examined in laboratory experiments
   the binding of dissolved organic matter from the forest floor to
   amorphous AI(OH)(3), goethite, kaolinite, and illite and to subsoils in
   order to compare the sorption and desorption of dissolved organic C with
   that of dissolved organic N. The mineral samples were equilibrated with
   acidic solutions of organic matter at pH4. In the equilibrium solutions
   organic C and N and their contribution to two operationally defined
   fractions, namely the so-called hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions,
   were determined. We measured neutral and acidic amino sugars to discover
   the nature of the binding of organic N. Within the hydrophilic and
   hydrophobic fractions, the sorption and desorption of organic C and N
   did not differ, indicating that there was no preferential binding of
   N-containing compounds. The hydrophilic fraction contained more N and
   sorbed less than the hydrophobic fraction, and so the overall retention
   of organic N by the mineral phases and subsoils was smaller than that of
   organic C. Among the amino sugar compounds, muramic acid was
   preferentially removed from the solution, whereas the neutral amino
   sugars were sorbed similar to organic C. The results suggest that the
   sorption of N-containing compounds is favoured by acidic groups and not
   by amino groups.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical composition and degradation of dissolved amino acids and
   glucose by bacteria were investigated in the northern Sargasso Sea.
   Multiple pools of amino acids were discerned based on microbial
   reactivity. Concentrations of dissolved free amino acid (DFAA) were
   highest in the surface waters, where rapid utilization of DFAA accounted
   for <20\% of the measured bacterial growth requirements for C and N.
   Dissolved combined amino acid (DCAA) and protein (using the BCA assay)
   concentrations were 10- to 25-fold higher than that of DFAA. In surface
   waters, DCAA was largely identifiable as protein (similar to 100\%), but
   most of the DCAA at depth (>100 m) did not respond to the protein assay
   (<50\%). In surface waters, protein was the dominant form of organic
   nitrogen used to support bacterial growth, supporting 20 to 65\% of the
   calculated bacterial N demand. In deeper waters, utilization of a
   modified form of protein (glucosylated protein) accounted for the
   highest portion of the bacterial growth demands. Free and combined amino
   acids did not meet the full bacterial N demand at depth, and other,
   unmeasured nitrogen sources were required. Similar to trends in
   utilization, maximum uptake rate (V-max) for protein was highest in
   surfaces waters. Modified protein had higher V-max in deep waters,
   consistent with the longer turnover time of this pool of DCAA and the
   likelihood that it is produced in the surface and transported to depth
   each winter during mixing events.}},

Journal = {{GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{1990}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{We used methane-production measurements of slurried peat to study
   controls of methane production in six contrasting Appalachian wetland
   sites.  The sites differed widely in plant-community composition and in
   rates of methane production, which varied from 3-mu-mol/L/day in
   slurried-peat samples from a shrub-dominated bog to 216-mu-mol/L/day in
   peat from a spruce-forested wetland.  Three controlling factors of
   methane production were examined:  organic-chemical components of the
   peat (e.g., hot-water soluble, sulfuric acid soluble, sulfuric acid
   insoluble), concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, and rates of
   sulfate reduction.  Peats from shrub-dominated sites contained mostly
   acid-insoluble organic matter, which was presumably recalcitrant to
   microbial decomposition.  In contrast, peats from moss-and
   sedge-dominated sites contained mostly acid-soluble organic matter,
   which was presumably labile.  Differences of organic-chemical components
   of the peat could explain about 50\% of the variation in rates of
   methane production among samples from the sites.  Rates of sulfate
   reduction in peat samples were relatively high (5-397-mu-mol/L/day),
   despite low in situ concentrations of dissolved sulfate (<
   250-mu-mol/L), but sulfate reduction was not well correlated with rates
   of methane production, nor were concentrations of dissolved organic
   carbon.  Amendments of methanol and trimethylamine to peat samples from
   any individual site did not stimulate rates of methane production.  In
   general but not always, glucose, hydrogen, and acetate amendments
   stimulated rates of methane production.  Sulfate amendments that
   stimulated sulfate reduction also inhibited methane production by 90\%;
   however, reversal of the inhibition was achieved by acetate and hydrogen
   amendments.  Control of methane production in these organic-rich
   wetlands is related more to organic-chemical components of the peat than
   to the activity of coincident sulfate-reducing bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial and diurnal tidal variability of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) concentrations and the composition of dissolved organic matter
   (DOM), as evaluated by high-temperature catalytic oxidation and
   excitation-emission matrix combined with parallel factor analysis
   (EEM-PARAFAC), respectively, were determined in Liverpool Bay.
   EEM-PARAFAC modeling resulted in six fluorescent components
   characterized as terrestrial humic-like (two), microbial humic-like
   (two), and protein-like (two). The spatial distributions of DOC and the
   four humic-like components were negatively correlated with salinity in
   the high-salinity waters observed in this study (30.41-33.75),
   suggesting that terrestrial DOM was conservatively distributed. The
   spatial patterns of protein-like components were largely different from
   those of DOC, humic-like components, and chlorophyll a, suggesting that
   these distributions were the combined result of production and
   degradation in the bay in addition to river inputs. These findings
   suggest that the DOM dynamics in Liverpool Bay are strongly controlled
   by river-dominated allochthonous DOM inputs with some less significant
   contributions of autochthonous DOM within the bay. In addition, the
   temporal variations of DOM associated with the diurnal tidal cycles were
   determined at one inshore (31.34-32.24 salinity) and one offshore
   (33.64-33.75 salinity) station in the bay. Negative linear relationships
   between salinity and DOM characteristics, i.e., DOC, humic-like, and
   protein-like components, were observed at the inshore station. In
   contrast, no relationship was observed at the offshore station,
   suggesting that the export of DOM through rivers and possibly tidal
   flats have a noticeable influence on DOM concentration and composition
   up to a relatively elevated salinity of around 33 in Liverpool Bay.}},

Abstract = {{Release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was studied on macroalga,
   Ecklonia cava Kjellman, by in situ field bag experiments, which were
   designed to keep the algal body under natural field condition, in Oura
   Bay, Shimoda, lzu Peninsula, Japan, from August 2003 to May 2005. The
   experiments were conducted 6 times in different seasons. The
   concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the experimental bag
   generally increased during the first 1-2 days, showing the release of
   DOC from algae. The daily release rates of DOC varied between 0.12 and
   5.8 mgC per g (dry wt) of the algal blades per day. The seasonal
   variability of the DOC release rate was similar to those of the growth
   and the photosynthetic rates reported by the previous studies on E. cava
   in the same location. The fractions of the DOC release of the net
   primary production accounted for 18-62\%. These contributions are
   comparable to other macroalgae in the previous studies (27-43\%) using
   other macroalgae. Analysis of organic composition of DOM using gas
   chromatography (neutral aldose composition) and spectrometry (UV-visible
   and fluorescence) indicates that E. cava usually release extracellular
   products containing mucilaginous polysaccharides containing fucose as a
   main constituent and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The
   release of these organic compounds is likely performed as the ordinary
   metabolism of brown algae. An exceptional release of a considerable
   amount of protein and carbohydrates mainly composed of mannose was found
   in June 2004, probably reflecting leakage of the intracellular material
   by an autolysis of the algal cells. The high DOM release rate in the
   present study suggests that macroalgae would be one of the important DOM
   producers in coastal regions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In order to improve our understanding of the relationships between the
   late Hauterivian oceanic anoxic Faraoni event, contemporaneous platform
   drowning along the northern Tethyan margin and global environmental
   change in general, we established high-resolution delta C-13 and delta
   O-18 curves for the late Hauterivian and the entire Barremian stage.
   These data were obtained from whole-rock carbonate samples from the
   Veveyse de Chatel-Saint-Denis section (Switzerland), the Fiume-Bosso
   section and the nearby Gorgo a Cerbara section (central Italy), and the
   Angles section (Barremian stratotype, France). We observe an increase of
   0.3 parts per thousand. in mean delta C-13 values within sediments from
   the middle Hauterivian Subsaynella sayni ammonite zone to the
   Hauterivian-Barremian boundary; delta C-13 values remain essentially
   stable during the early Barremian. During the latest early Barremian and
   most of the late Barremian, delta C-13 values increase slowly (until the
   Imerites giraudi zone) and the latest Barremian is characterized by a
   negative trend in delta C-13 values, with minimal values at the
   Barremian-Aptian boundary. During the earliest Aptian, delta C-13 mean
   values start to rise again and attain+2.25 parts per thousand.. We
   interpret the evolution of the delta C-13 record as resulting from the
   interaction between changes in the carbon cycle in the Tethyan basin and
   the adjacent platforms and continents. In particular, changes towards
   warmer and more humid conditions on the continent and coeval phases of
   platform drowning along the northern Tethyan margin may have contributed
   to enhance the oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) reservoir which
   may have pushed the delta C-13 record towards more negative values and
   exerted a general attenuation on the delta C-13 record. From this may
   have come the general change from a heterozoan to a photozoan carbonate
   platform community, which influenced the evolution in delta C-13 values
   by increasing the export of aragonite and diminishing export of
   dissolved organic carbon into the basins. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   reported for open ocean. Results from the fall cruise were characterized
   by increased surface concentrations, sharper gradients, and shallower
   penetration of the photochemically generated H2O2. The impact of the
   river water can be traced in the eastern Caribbean by increased
   dissolved organic matter fluorescence, lower salinity, and faster
   hydrogen peroxide accumulation rates in surface samples (up to 20 times

Abstract = {{P>The impact of temperature on bacterial activity and community
   composition was investigated in arctic lakes and streams in northern
   Alaska. Aquatic bacterial communities incubated at different
   temperatures had different rates of production, as measured by
   14C-leucine uptake, indicating that populations within the communities
   had different temperature optima. Samples from Toolik Lake inlet and
   outlet were collected at water temperatures of 14.2 degrees C and 15.9
   degrees C, respectively, and subsamples incubated at temperatures
   ranging from 6 degrees C to 20 degrees C. After 5 days, productivity
   rates varied from 0.5 to similar to 13.7 mu g C l-1 day-1 and two
   distinct activity optima appeared at 12 degrees C and 20 degrees C. At
   these optima, activity was 2- to 11-fold higher than at other incubation
   temperatures. The presence of two temperature optima indicates
   psychrophilic and psychrotolerant bacteria dominate under different
   conditions. Community fingerprinting via denaturant gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes showed strong shifts in the
   composition of communities driven more by temperature than by
   differences in dissolved organic matter source; e.g. four and seven
   unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found only at 2 degrees C
   and 25 degrees C, respectively, and not found at other incubation
   temperatures after 5 days. The impact of temperature on bacteria is
   complex, influencing both bacterial productivity and community
   composition. Path analysis of measurements of 24 streams and lakes
   sampled across a catchment 12 times in 4 years indicates variable timing
   and strength of correlation between temperature and bacterial
   production, possibly due to bacterial community differences between
   sites. As indicated by both field and laboratory experiments, shifts in
   dominant community members can occur on ecologically relevant time
   scales (days), and have important implications for understanding the
   relationship of bacterial diversity and function.}},

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal variation and metabolic activity of the microbial
   community were studied in coarse-grained Middle Atlantic Bight shelf
   sediments in relation to pools of dissolved and particulate carbon.
   Algal cells were present 8-11 cm into the sediment, probably due to
   hydrodynamically induced pore water flushing and sediment mixing. The
   coarse-grained (> 70 mum) fraction of the sediment held the major share
   (61-98\%) of benthic bacteria. Bacterial and algal cell abundances,
   exoenzymatic activity, and {[}DOC] generally showed higher values in
   May/July 2001 than in August/December 2000. Carbohydrates and proteins
   were hydrolyzed at potential rates of 1-12 nmol cm(-3) h(-1)
   (beta-glucosidase) and 3-70 nmol cm(-1) h(-1) (aminopeptidase),
   respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of the benthic
   microbes assigned 45-56\% of DAPI-stained cells to Eubacteria and less
   than 2\% to Eukarya. The prokaryotic community was dominated by
   planctomycetes and members of the Cytophaga/Flavobacterium cluster. Near
   the sediment surface, iodonitrotetrazolium violet reducing cells, that
   are considered actively respiring, amounted to 15-29\% of total
   bacteria. Despite a low organic content (particulate organic carbon
   <0.03\%) and relatively low bacterial abundances (<10(9) cm(-3)), the
   Middle Atlantic Bight shelf sediments showed organic matter turnover
   rates that are comparable to those found in organic-rich finer-grained
   deposits. Our findings suggest a high biocatalytic filtration activity
   in these coarse permeable sediments. (C) 2002 Federation of European

Abstract = {{We have separated two groups of copper-complexing ligands (the weak and

   were about 0.54-1.21\% of the total dissolved organic matter (DOM), as
   determined by UV absorbance, and the strong ligands were about
   0.06-0.21\%. The results show that the stronger ligands were retained
   longer on the IMAC column, eluted later, and were accompanied by shorter
   wavelength UV absorbers, fluorescence maxima patterns with shorter
   wavelength excitation, and relatively ``fresher{''} organic matter. The
   weak ligands with logK ` (CuL) values of 6.6-7.7 had predominant
   humic-like fluorescence and may have been considerably degraded, while
   stronger ligands with logK ` (CuL)values of 8.9-9.3 had only
   protein-like fluorescence and were relatively newly produced, labile

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{123-130}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Stromatolites are laminated, lithified (CaCO3) sedimentary deposits
   formed by precipitation and/or sediment accretion by
   cyanobacterial-bacterial mat communities. Strometolites have been
   associated with these communities as far back as the Precambrian era
   some 2+ billion years ago. The means by which microbial communities
   mediate the precipitation processes have remained unclear, and are the
   subject of considerable debate and speculation. Two alternative
   explanations for microbially mediated precipitation include: (i)
   cyanobacterial photosynthesis increases pH in a system supersaturated in
   respect of CaCO3, resulting in CaCO3 precipitation and then laminated
   lithification, and (ii) decomposition of cyanobacterial extracellular
   organic matter (e.g. sheaths, mucilage and organic acids) by
   microheterotrophs leads to release of organic-bound Ca2+ ions and CaCO3
   precipitation. We evaluated these explanations by examining
   metabolically active, lithifying stromatolitic mat communities from
   Highborne Gay, Bahamas, using microautoradiography.
   Micro-autoradiographic detection of (CO2)-C-14 fixation and H-3 organic
   matter (D-glucose and an amino acid mixture) utilization by
   photosynthetically active cyanobacteria and microheterotrophs, combined
   with community-level uptake experiments, indicate that bacteria, rather
   than cyanobacteria are the dominant sites of CaCO3 deposition. In the
   oligotrophic waters in which stromatolites exist, microheterotrophs are
   reliant on the photosynthetic community as a main source of organic
   matter. Therefore, autotrophic production indirectly controls
   microbially mediated precipitation and stromatolite formation in these
   shallow marine environments.}},

Abstract = {{Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) are considered to be generated
   abiotically from dissolved extracellular polysaccharides released mainly
   by phytoplankton. TEP may affect the aggregation rate of particles and
   therefore influence the flux of organic carbon to the deep ocean. The
   role of NO3- limitation in the production of TEP by the marine diatom
   Chaetoceros calcitrans was investigated. C. calcitrans was grown in
   batch cultures with different initial nitrate concentrations (25, 75,
   150, 250 and 450 mu mol l(-1)). Nitrate affected the production of TEP
   in 2 distinct ways. The initial specific growth rate and maximum
   concentration of biomass las estimated by chlorophyll a, cell number,
   total particulate carbon or total particulate nitrogen) reached in every
   culture was directly dependent on the initial NO3- concentration.
   Maximum TEP concentration followed this trend, and was significantly
   linearly correlated with several biomass-related variables and with the
   initial NO3- concentration. However, despite the general trend of direct
   covariation between TEP concentration and phytoplankton biomass, NO3-
   has a more specific effect. A close examination of the exponential phase
   shows that the net production of TEP per biomass was higher in N-limited
   cultures. In the N-sufficient cultures, during Day 2, there was even a
   decrease in the concentration of TEP per unit of biomass with respect to
   the inoculum. Our results support the hypothesis that, under
   N-limitation, a large proportion of the photosynthetically fixed carbon
   is channeled to TEP. The concentration of carbohydrate in the
   particulate fraction (PCH) was larger in N-limited cultures. The effect
   was clearer during exponential growth. In this phase there was a good
   agreement between the response of TEP and PCH to N limitation. Unlike
   TEP, PCH decreased sharply during the stationary and senescent phases.
   The decrease of PCH was associated with an increase in dissolved organic
   carbon and an increase in the number of bacteria in the cultures.}},

Abstract = {{Fluxes of total CO2, O2, NO3- + NO2-, NH4+, DON (dissolved organic
   nitrogen) and HS- were measured across the interface of a coastal bay
   sediment for 43 d. The seawater overlying the defaunated sediment cores
   was changed continuously. Two treatments were employed: oxygenated
   overlying water (OX-cores) and anoxic water (AN-cores). Fluxes were
   measured before and after addition of an organic substrate, and loss of
   POM (particulate organic matter) was measured at the end of the
   experiment. Loss of POC (particulate organic carbon) from the sediment
   was the same under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. However, the
   highest efflux of CO2 was measured in the OX-cores, and the highest
   efflux of DOC occurred in the AN-cores before and after addition of
   fresh substrate. Similarly, loss of PON (particulate organic nitrogen)
   from the sediment was the same in the 2 treatments, but the highest
   fluxes of NH4+ and DON were measured in the AN-cores. Our conclusion is
   that degradation of POM is the same under both aerobic and anaerobic
   conditions, but that mineralization of organic molecules is less
   effective under anaerobic conditions. Before substrate addition there
   was an influx of NO3- in both OX- and AN-cores, and the estimated
   nitrification rate in the OX-cores was 1 to 2 mmol m-2 d-1. The
   estimated denitrification rate contributed 3 to 6\% to total carbon
   respiration. After addition of the substrate, fluxes of all constituents
   increased. The estimated denitrification rate constituted < 3\% of total
   respiration. There was a large efflux of HS- in AN-cores. During the
   experimental period, the losses of original POC and PON were calculated
   to be 2.6 and 4.0\%, respectively. Relative to the initial values, the
   pore water constituents increased with incubation, and the integrated
   AN/OX ratios for NH4+, DON and total CO2 were 1.2, 1.5 and 1.6,

Abstract = {{Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was measured in the spring
   and summer in the northern Gulf of Mexico with the ECOShuttle, a towed,
   instrumented, undulating vehicle. A submersible pump mounted on the
   vehicle supplied continuously flowing, uncontaminated seawater to online
   instruments in the shipboard laboratory and allowed discrete samples to
   be taken for further analysis. CDOM in the northern Gulf of Mexico was
   dominated by freshwater inputs from the Mississippi River through the
   Birdfoot region and to the west by discharge from the Atchafalaya River.
   CDOM was more extensively dispersed in the high-flow period in the
   spring but in both time periods was limited by stratification to the
   upper 12 m or so. Thin, subsurface CDOM maxima were observed below the
   plume during the highly stratified summer period but were absent in the
   spring. However, there was evidence of significant in situ biological
   production of CDOM in both seasons.
   The Mississippi River freshwater end member was similar in spring and
   summer, while the Atchafalaya end member was significantly higher in the
   spring. In both time periods, the Atchafalaya was significantly higher
   in CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than the Mississippi
   presumably due to local production and exchange within the coastal
   wetlands along the lower Atchafalaya which are absent along the lower
   Mississippi. Nearshore waters may also have higher CDOM due to
   outwelling from coastal wetlands. High-resolution measurements allow the
   differentiation of various water masses and are indicative of rapidly
   varying (days to weeks) source waters. Highly dynamic but conservative
   mixing between various freshwater and marine end members apparently
   dominates CDOM distributions in the area with significant in situ
   biological inputs (bacterial degradation of phytoplankton detritus),
   evidence of flocculation, and minor photobleaching effects also
   observed. It is clear that high-resolution measurements and adaptive
   sampling strategies allow a more detailed examination of the processes
   that control CDOM distributions in river-dominated systems. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{The composition of bacterial communities growing at the expense of
   high-molecular weight (HMW; >1000 Da) and low-molecular weight (LMW;
   <1000 Da) fractions of dissolved organic carbon from a southeastern US
   estuary was determined by sequencing and terminal restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons in 2
   enrichment studies. 16S rDNA sequence analysis indicated that the
   bacterial communities growing on the LMW fraction were dominated by
   <gamma>- and epsilon -Proteobacteria related to Pseudomonas fluorescens
   and Arcobacter nitrofigilis (accounting for 90 \% of the clones) while
   the communities using the HMW fraction were dominated by alpha-, beta-,
   and gamma -Proteobacteria and Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides related
   to Rhizobium-Agrobacterium, Janthinobacterium lividum, Pseudomonas
   fluorescens, Marinobacterium georgiense, Pseudoalteromonas, and
   Sphingobacterium comitans (accounting for 98 \% of the clones).
   Methylotrophic bacteria were present in the inoculum community but not
   found in either LMW or HMW enrichments. T-RFLP analysis of the
   enrichment communities showed measurable changes in community
   composition during the enrichment period, and companion respiration
   assays confirmed utilization of sufficient HMW and LMW carbon to support
   several bacterial generations. Although the composition of the estuarine
   inoculum used for the 2 enrichment studies (conducted in April 1997 and
   May 1999) was quite similar, the communities developing on the HMW and
   LMW fractions differed between experiments, potentially reflecting
   temporal variations in the chemical composition of the dissolved organic
   carbon.}},

Title = {{Inefficient microbial production of refractory dissolved organic matter
   in the ocean}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the oceans constitutes a major carbon
   pool involved in global biogeochemical cycles. More than 96\% of the
   marine DOM resists microbial degradation for thousands of years. The
   composition of this refractory DOM (RDOM) exhibits a molecular signature
   ubiquitously detected in the deep oceans. Surprisingly efficient
   microbial transformation of labile into stable forms of DOM has been
   shown previously, implying that microorganisms apparently produce far
   more RDOM than needed to sustain the global pool. Here we show, by
   assessing the microbial formation and transformation of DOM in
   unprecedented molecular detail for 3 years, that most of the microbial
   DOM is different from RDOM in the ocean. Only <0.4\% of the net
   community production is channelled into a form of DOM that is
   undistinguishable from oceanic RDOM. Our study provides a molecular
   background for global models on the production, turnover and
   accumulation of marine DOM.}},

Abstract = {{The substrate partitioning of sympatric populations of freshwater
   bacterioplankton was studied via microautoradiography and fluorescence
   in situ hybridization. Fourteen radiolabeled tracers were used to assess
   microbial acquisition spectra of low-molecular-weight (LMW) organic
   compounds. The most abundant group, ac1 Actinobacteria, were highly
   active in leucine, thymidine and glucose assimilation, whereas
   Alphaproteobacteria from the LD12 lineage (the freshwater sister clade
   of SAR11) only weakly incorporated these tracers, but exhibited a
   distinct preference for glutamine and glutamate. Different Bacteroidetes
   showed contrasting uptake patterns: Flavobacteriales did not incorporate
   significant amounts of any LMW compound, and Cyclobacteriaceae were
   clearly specialized on leucine, glucose and arginine. Betaproteobacteria
   represented the most active and versatile bacterioplankton fraction and
   >90\% of them could be assigned to eight species-to genus-like
   populations with contrasting substrate specialization. Limnohabitans sp.
   were the most abundant and active Betaproteobacteria, incorporating
   almost all tracers. While three closely related betaproteobacterial
   populations substantially differed in their uptake spectra, two more
   distantly related lineages had very similar preferences, and one
   population did not incorporate any tracer. The dominant phototrophic
   microorganism, the filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens,
   assimilated several substrates, whereas other (pico)cyanobacteria had no
   heterotrophic activity. The variable extent of specialization by the
   studied bacterial taxa on subsets of LMW compounds contrasts theoretical
   considerations about non-selective microbial substrate assimilation at
   oligotrophic conditions. This physiological niche separation might be
   one explanation for the coexistence of freshwater bacterioplankton
   species in a seemingly uniform environment. The ISME Journal (2013) 7,

Abstract = {{There is an increasing concern that a considerable fraction of
   engineered nanoparticles (ENs), including quantum dots (QDs), will
   eventually find their way into the marine environment and have negative
   impacts on plankton. As ENs enter the ocean, they will encounter
   extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from microbial sources before
   directly interacting with plankton cells. In this study, EPS harvested
   from four phytoplankton species, Amphora sp., Dunaliella tertiolecta,
   Phaeocystis globosa, and Thalassiosira pseudonana, were examined for
   potential interactions with CdSe nonfunctionalized and functionalized
   (carboxyl- and amine-) QDs in artificial seawater. Our results show that
   EPS do not reduce the solubility of QDs but rather decrease their
   stability. The degradation rate of QDs was positively correlated to the
   protein composition of EPS (defined by the ratio of
   protein/carbohydrate). Two approaches showed significant inhibition to
   the degradation of carboxyl-functionalized QDs: (1) the presence of an
   antioxidant, such as N-acetyl cysteine, and (2) absence of light. Owing
   to the complexity in evaluating integrated effects of QDs intrinsic
   properties and the external environmental factors that control the
   stability of QDs, conclusions must be based on a careful consideration
   of all these factors when attempting to evaluate the bioavailability of
   QDs and other ENs in the marine environments.}},

Abstract = {{Seven years (2001-2008) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) vertical
   profiles were examined in order to assess the main processes determining
   DOC concentration and distribution in the meso- and bathypelagic layers
   of the Mediterranean Sea. As expected, DOC showed high and highly
   variable concentrations in the surface layer of 57-68 mu M (average
   values between 0 and 100 m), with a decrease to 44-53 mu M between 200
   and 500 m. Deep DOC distribution was strongly affected by deep-water
   formation, with a significant increase to values of 76 mu M in recently
   ventilated deep waters, and low concentrations, comparable to those
   observed in the open oceanic waters (34-45 mu M), where the oldest, deep
   waters occurred. In winter 2004/2005 a deep-water formation event was
   observed and the consequent DOC export at depth was estimated to range
   between 0.76-3.02 Tg C month(-1). In the intermediate layer, the main
   path of the Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) was followed in order to
   estimate the DOC consumption rate in its core. Multiple regression
   between DOC, apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), and salinity indicated
   that 38\% of the oxygen consumption was related to DOC mineralization
   when the effect of mixing was removed. In deep waters of the southern
   Adriatic Sea a DOC decrease of 6 mu M, together with an AOU increase of
   9 mu M, was observed between the end of January 2008 and the end of June
   2008 (5 months). These data indicate a rate of microbial utilization of
   DOC of about 1.2 mu M C month(-1), with 92\% of the oxygen consumption
   due to DOC mineralization. These values are surprisingly high for the
   deep sea and represent a peculiarity of the Mediterranean Sea. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Chlorine is a minor constituent of most rocks and a minor ( although
   essential) element in plants, but it cycles rapidly through the
   hydrosphere and atmosphere. In forest ecosystem studies, chloride ion
   (Cl-) is often thought to be conservative in the sense that the sources
   and sinks within the ecosystem are assumed negligible compared to inputs
   and outputs. As such, Cl- is often used as a conservative tracer to
   assess sources and transformations of other ions. In this paper we
   summarize research on chloride over the course of 36 years ( 1964 -
   2000) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in central New
   Hampshire, USA. Evidence presented here suggests that in the 1960s and
   1970s the dominant source of atmospheric Cl- deposition was from
   pollutant sources, probably coal burning. In the 1970s the Cl- inputs in
   bulk deposition declined, and the lower Cl- deposition in the last two
   decades is dominated by marine sources. Between 1964 and 2000 there was
   no significant trend in Cl- export in stream flow, thus the net
   hydrologic flux (NHF = bulk deposition inputs - streamflow outputs) has
   changed over this period. Early in the record the NHF was on average
   positive, indicating net retention of Cl- within the system, but since
   about 1980 the NHF has been consistently negative, indicating an
   unmeasured input or source within the ecosystem. Dry deposition can
   account for at least part of that unmeasured source, and it appears that
   release of Cl- from mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) may also
   play an important role. We believe that accumulation of Cl- in
   vegetation during the 1960s and 1970s offset the unmeasured source and
   resulted in net ecosystem retention. Accumulation of vegetative biomass
   has ceased since about 1982, leading to the apparent net export (
   negative NHF) since that time. Although we have no direct measurements
   of Cl- accumulation in vegetation, our estimates suggest that an
   aggrading forest could sequester about 32 mol Cl ha(-1) year(-1), or
   about a third of the annual average bulk deposition flux to this
   ecosystem. Experimental additions of Cl- to the forest floor cause
   increases in Cl- concentration in foliage, throughfall, and soil
   solution. Manipulations of vegetation also affect the Cl- cycle.
   Harvesting or devegetation of watersheds causes an increase in the Cl-
   concentration and flux in stream water for several years after the
   disturbance. This period of release is followed by a period of
   reaccumulation of Cl- that may last more than 15 years. In this respect,
   the behavior of Cl- after disturbance parallels that of NO3-, for which
   export increases after disturbance due to reduced plant nitrogen uptake
   and mineralization of nitrogen from detritus, rather than SO42-, for
   which export decreases after disturbance due to pH-dependent adsorption
   onto mineral soils. The interannual pattern of Cl- export from the
   system primarily reflects the atmospheric inputs, but the net retention
   and cycling of Cl- within the system appears to be largely under
   biological, rather than geochemical, control.}},

Title = {{The partition of fluoranthene and pyrene between suspended particles and

Abstract = {{Particle-water interactions are one of the most important mechanisms
   controlling the distribution and movement of hydrophobic organic
   chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in aquatic
   environments (e.g. estuaries and oceans). To accurately predict the
   transport and fates of hydrophobic contaminants in estuarine and coastal
   marine environments, the partition coefficient (K-p) and organic carbon
   normalised partition coefficient (K-oc) are widely used in various
   biogeochemical models. Such partition coefficients may be calculated
   from the so-called linear free energy relationships between K-p, K-oc
   and more easily measured parameters such as the octanol-water partition
   coefficient (K-ow). However K-p and K-oc values measured for real
   environmental samples of water and particles obtained from seasonal
   field surveys in the Humber Estuary, UK deviated from such ideals. For
   example, K-p values showed no correlation with the fraction organic
   carbon content of particles (f(oc)) and instead of being constant, K-oc,
   values varied with f(oc). Both K-p and K-oc were 1-3 orders of magnitude
   higher than those predicted from the simple equilibrium-partitioning
   model, but were in good agreement with several other recently published
   field studies. To improve our understanding of PAH partitioning, the
   soot carbon (SC) content of particulate samples was measured so that the
   simple partition model can be extended to incorporate SC. The partition
   coefficients derived from the extended partition model are very close to
   the field K(p)s. The results suggest that PAHs associated with particles
   are in fact present in the form of soot and soot-like particles that are
   not subject to particle-water equilibrations. In other words, the PAHs
   on soot-like particles are extremely strongly bound and not influenced
   by further partitioning between the particles and water. However, there
   are still limitations with the extended partition model as it failed to
   simulate the field K-oc values. No correlation was found between the
   partition coefficients and salinity, which again we attribute to the
   non-equilibrium nature of the PAHs. However both K-p and K-oc generally
   decreased with increasing suspended solids concentrations (SSC) in the
   estuary. Such a relationship is probably due to the mixing of soot-like
   permanently suspended particles with resuspended estuarine sedimentary
   particles at the higher SSC values, and to the increased concentrations
   of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) associated with increase in SSC.
   However, it has been shown that DOC concentrations are not a suitable
   tool for correcting the SSC effect. There is therefore an urgent need to
   harmonise the laboratory and field approaches for K-p measurements. (C)

Abstract = {{Constraining the fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) delivered by
   rivers is a key to understand the global carbon cycle, since DOM
   mineralization directly influences air-sea CO2 exchange and multiple
   biogeochemical processes. The Amazon River exports large amounts of DOM,
   and yet the fate of this material in the ocean remains unclear. Here we
   investigate the molecular composition and transformations of DOM in the
   Amazon River-ocean continuum using ultrahigh resolution mass
   spectrometry and geochemical and biological tracers. We show that there
   is a strong gradient in source and composition of DOM along the
   continuum, and that dilution of riverine DOM in the ocean is the
   dominant pattern of variability in the system. Alterations in DOM
   composition are observed in the plume associated with the addition of
   new organic compounds by phytoplankton and with bacterial and
   photochemical transformations. The relative importance of each of these
   drivers varies spatially and is modulated by seasonal variations in
   river discharge and ocean circulation. We further show that a large
   fraction (50-76\%) of the Amazon River DOM is surprisingly stable in the
   coastal ocean. This results in a globally significant river plume with a
   strong terrigenous signature and in substantial export of terrestrially
   derived organic carbon from the continental margin, where it can be
   entrained in the large-scale circulation and potentially contribute to
   the long-term storage of terrigenous production and to the recalcitrant
   carbon pool found in the deep ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the rapidly increasing volume of research on the biological and
   photochemical degradation of DOC (dissolved organic carbon) in aquatic
   environments, little is known of the large-scale patterns in
   biologically and photochemically degradable DOC (BDOC and PDOC,
   respectively) in continental watersheds, and on the links that exist
   between these two key properties that greatly influence the flow of
   carbon from continents to oceans. Here we explored the patterns in the
   concentrations and proportions of BDOC and PDOC across hundreds of
   boreal lakes, rivers and wetlands spanning a large range of system
   trophic status and terrestrial influence, and compared the drivers of
   these two reactive pools of DOC at the landscape level. Using
   standardized incubations of natural waters, we found that the
   concentrations of BDOC and PDOC covaried across all systems studied but
   were nevertheless related to different pools of dissolved organic matter
   (DOM; identified by fluorescence analyses) in ambient waters.
   Concentrations of nutrients and protein-like fluorescent DOM (FDOM)
   explained nearly half of the variation in BDOC, whereas PDOC was
   exclusively predicted by DOM optical properties, consistent with the
   photochemical degradability of specific FDOM pools that we
   experimentally determined. The concentrations of colored DOM (CDOM),
   which we use here as a proxy of terrestrial influence, almost entirely
   accounted for the observed relationship between FDOM and the
   concentrations of both BDOC and PDOC. The concentrations of CDOM and of
   the putative biolabile fluorescence component shifted from complete
   decoupling in clear-water environments to strong coupling in darker
   streams and wetlands. This suggests a baseline autochthonous BDOC pool
   fueled by internal production that is gradually overwhelmed by
   land-derived BDOC as terrestrial influence increases across landscape
   gradients. The importance of land as a major source of both biologically
   and photochemically degradable DOC for continental watersheds resulted
   in a partial coupling of those carbon pools in natural freshwaters,
   despite fundamental contrasts in terms of their composition and
   regulation.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{1291-1308}},
Abstract = {{Responses to ocean acidification in plankton communities were studied
   during a CO2-enrichment experiment in the Arctic Ocean, accomplished
   from June to July 2010 in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard (78 degrees 56'2 `' N,
   11 degrees 53'6 `' E). Enclosed in 9 mesocosms (volume: 43.9-47.6m(3)),
   plankton was exposed to CO2 concentrations, ranging from glacial to
   projected mid-next-century levels. Fertilization with inorganic
   nutrients at day 13 of the experiment supported the accumulation of
   phytoplankton biomass, as indicated by two periods of high chl a
   concentration.
   This study tested for CO2 sensitivities in primary production (PP) of
   particulate organic carbon (PPPOC) and of dissolved organic carbon
   (PPDOC). Therefore, C-14-bottle incubations (24 h) of mesocosm samples
   were performed at 1m depth receiving about 60\% of incoming radiation.
   PP for all mesocosms averaged 8.06 +/- 3.64 mu molC L-1 d(-1) and was
   slightly higher than in the outside fjord system. Comparison between
   mesocosms revealed significantly higher PPPOC at elevated compared to
   low pCO(2) after nutrient addition. PPDOC was significantly higher in
   CO2-enriched mesocosms before as well as after nutrient addition,
   suggesting that CO2 had a direct influence on DOC production. DOC
   concentrations inside the mesocosms increased before nutrient addition
   and more in high CO2 mesocosms. After addition of nutrients, however,
   further DOC accumulation was negligible and not significantly different
   between treatments, indicating rapid utilization of freshly produced
   DOC. Bacterial biomass production (BP) was coupled to PP in all
   treatments, indicating that 3.5 +/- 1.9\% of PP or 21.6 +/- 12.5\% of
   PPDOC provided on average sufficient carbon for synthesis of bacterial
   biomass. During the later course of the bloom, the response of
   C-14-based PP rates to CO2 enrichment differed from net community
   production (NCP) rates that were also determined during this mesocosm
   campaign. We conclude that the enhanced release of labile DOC during
   autotrophic production at high CO2 exceedingly stimulated activities of
   heterotrophic microorganisms. As a consequence, increased PP induced
   less NCP, as suggested earlier for carbon-limited microbial systems in
   the Arctic.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional (2D) reactive transport model is used to investigate
   the controls on nutrient (NO3-, NH4+, PO4) dynamics in a coastal
   aquifer. The model couples density-dependent flow to a reaction network
   which includes oxic degradation of organic matter, denitrification, iron
   oxide reduction, nitrification, Fe2+ oxidation and sorption of PO4 onto
   iron oxides. Porewater measurements from a well transect at Waquoit Bay,
   MA, USA indicate the presence of a reducing plume with high Fe2+, NH4+,
   DOC (dissolved organic carbon) and PO4 concentrations overlying a more
   oxidizing NO3- -rich plume. These two plumes travel nearly
   conservatively until they start to overlap in the intertidal coastal
   sediments prior to discharge into the bay. In this zone, the aeration of
   the surface beach sediments drives nitrification and allows the
   precipitation of iron oxide, which leads to the removal Of PO4 through
   sorption. Model simulations suggest that removal of NO3- through
   denitrification is inhibited by the limited overlap between the two
   freshwater plumes, as well as by the refractory nature of terrestrial
   DOC. Submarine groundwater discharge is a significant source of NO3- to
   the bay. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and optical characteristics of dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) were determined in 120 rain samples collected in Wilmington, North
   Carolina, USA, between February 21, 2002 and August 11, 2003. All
   rainwater samples contained chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
   as well as fluorescent compounds. The absorbance spectra of CDOM in the
   samples decreased exponentially with wavelength with little or no
   measurable absorbance past 550 nm. Fluorescence excitation emission
   spectra (EEMS) of the precipitation revealed the presence of four major
   peaks indicating both terrestrial and marine influences. There was a
   strong positive correlation between total integrated fluorescence and
   the absorbance coefficient at 300 nm in rainwater samples, suggesting
   that these optical properties are directly interrelated and that the
   compounds responsible for absorbance may be the same as those
   responsible for fluorescence. Air-mass back-trajectory analysis
   indicated elevated CDOM levels in continentally influenced rainwater
   relative to marine dominated events implying that anthropogenic and/or
   terrestrial sources are important contributors to CDOM levels in
   precipitation. The presence of highly absorbing and fluorescing CDOM in
   rainwater has significant ramifications in atmospheric chemistry and may
   play a previously unrecognized role in the wavelength dependent spectral
   attenuation of solar radiation by atmospheric waters.}},

Abstract = {{The major aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between
   the rates of microbial activities (phytoplankton primary production,
   bacterial secondary production, bacterial utilization of organic matter,
   enzymatic activities, protozoan grazing on bacteria), bacterial numbers,
   and dissolved organic carbon concentrations and the trophic state index
   (TSI) of lakes in the upper trophogenic water layer in the pelagial zone
   along the trophic gradient (from oligo/mesotrophy to hypereutrophy) in
   19 lakes of the Mazurian Lake District (northeastern Poland). Multiple
   regression analysis (analysis of variance-ANOVA) on all collected data
   and the TSI along eutrophication gradient showed that all studied
   microbial processes and parameters were very tightly coupled to the
   trophic conditions of the studied lakes. All studied microbial processes
   involved in utilization and enzymatic degradation of organic matter were
   strongly positively dependent on the intensity and rates of
   photosynthetic organic matter production and exudation that markedly
   increased along the eutrophication gradient of lakes. V-max of alkaline
   phosphatase, aminopeptidase, and nonspecific esterase showed significant
   correlation with the TSI of the studied lakes. Protozoans removed a
   significant portion of bacterial production, i.e., from similar to 20\%
   to 75-85\% of newly produced bacterial biomass was simultaneously
   consumed by protozoans along the eutrophication gradient. These
   observations suggest that the importance of protozoan grazing on
   bacteria on regulation of bacterial production depends on lake
   productivity. The general working hypothesis that the intensity of
   microbial processes of organic matter can be tightly coupled to
   increasing eutrophication was proven in these studies.}},

Abstract = {{Blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum are annually
   recurrent events in south-east Tasmanian waters. Extensive blooms are
   preceded by a rainfall `trigger' and the associated influx of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM; otherwise known as humic substances) from land
   runoff. Culture studies were conducted to investigate the potential
   nutritive influence of DOM on G. catenatum. Using a seawater-based
   growth medium (28 parts per thousand salinity), enriched with nutrients
   but no DOM, the trace element selenium (as 10(-9) M selenite) limited
   growth rate and biomass (cell density and chlorophyll a). Addition of
   standard humic acid (aquatic Suwannee River Humic Acid available from
   the International Humic Substances Society; SHA) caused a 5-25 and
   30-99\% decrease in G. catenatum growth and biomass, respectively. In
   contrast, growth and biomass of G. catenatum were increased by
   approximately 15 and 30-60\%, respectively, when Suwannee River SHA and
   natural DOM (isolated from Huon River water, south-east Tasmania, by
   ultrafiltration) were added to cultures in the absence of any other
   chelators of associated trace metals. Under these conditions, biomass
   was limited by the macronutrients nitrate and phosphate suggesting that
   dissolved organic substances can change overall nutrient availability
   and/or uptake by G. catenatum, either by addition of nutrients (e.g.
   nitrogen and phosphorus) to the system, or by interaction with other
   nutrients (e.g. selenium). The importance of selenium for G. catenatum
   growth, its introduction into coastal systems in land runoff, and the
   interaction of selenium with DOM supports the widely accepted hypothesis
   that dissolved organic substances alter the supply of nutrients
   available for algal growth. From these observations it is clear that the
   outcome of DOM-nutrient interactions on algal growth is variable, and
   depends on the composition and amount of DOM, the concentration of
   nutrients in solution and the species- or strain-specific cellular
   nutrient requirements. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   Exponentially growing flagellates released 4-22\% of ingested nitrogen

   than ammonium release when ingestion was high, but lower than ammonium
   release when ingestion was low.  DCAA accumulated during the exponential
   growth phase of flagellates, suggesting that flagellates released DCAA. 
   We also measured the release rate of H-3-labeled compounds by
   flagellates grazing on bacteria labeled with {[}H-3]amino acids.  The
   results suggested that flagellates release significant amounts of

Abstract = {{Previous hypotheses had suggested that upwelled intrusions of
   nutrient-rich Gulf of Mexico slope water onto the West Florida Shelf
   (WFS) led to formation of red tides of Karenia brevis. However, coupled
   biophysical models of (1) wind- and buoyancy-driven circulation, (2)
   three phytoplankton groups ( diatoms, K. brevis, and microflagellates),
   (3) these slope water supplies of nitrate and silicate, and (4)
   selective grazing stress by copepods and protozoans found that diatoms
   won in one 1998 case of no light limitation by colored dissolved organic
   matter (CDOM). The diatoms lost to K. brevis during another CDOM case of
   the models. In the real world, field data confirmed that diatoms were
   indeed the dominant phytoplankton after massive upwelling in 1998, when
   only a small red tide of K. brevis was observed. Over a 7-month period
   of the CDOM-free scenario the simulated total primary production of the
   phytoplankton community was similar to1.8 g C m(-2) d(-1) along the 40-m
   isobath of the northern WFS, with the largest accumulation of biomass on
   the Florida Middle Ground (FMG). Despite such photosynthesis, these
   models of the WFS yielded a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere during
   spring and summer and suggested a small sink in the fall. With diatom
   losses of 90\% of their daily carbon fixation to herbivores the
   simulation supported earlier impressions of a short, diatom-based food
   web on the FMG, where organic carbon content of the surficial sediments
   is tenfold those of the surrounding seabeds. Farther south, the
   simulated near-bottom pools of ammonium were highest in summer, when
   silicon regeneration was minimal, leading to temporary Si limitation of
   the diatoms. Termination of these upwelled pulses of production by
   diatoms and nonsiliceous microflagellates mainly resulted from nitrate
   exhaustion in the model, however, mimicking most del(15)PON observations
   in the field. Yet, the CDOM-free case of the models failed to replicate
   the observed small red tide in December 1998, tagged with the del(15)N
   signature of nitrogen fixation. A large red tide of K. brevis did form
   in the CDOM-rich case, when estuarine supplies of CDOM favored the
   growth of the shade-adapted, ungrazed dinoflagellates. The usual
   formation of large harmful algal blooms of >1 ug chl L-1 (10(5) cells
   L-1) in the southern part of the WFS, between Tampa Bay and Charlotte
   Harbor, must instead depend upon local aeolian and estuarine supplies of
   nutrients and CDOM sun screen, not those from the shelf break. In the
   absence of slope water supplies, local upwelling instead focuses
   nitrate-poor innocula of co-occurring K. brevis and nitrogen fixers at
   coastal fronts for both aggregation and transfer of nutrients between
   these phytoplankton groups.}},

Abstract = {{The bioactive metals Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and Ni in Narragansett Bay, RI, were
   partitioned into soluble, colloidal and particulate size fractions using
   a combination of conventional and cross-flow filtrations. Particulate
   samples (0.2-8.0 mu m; > 8 mu m) were chemically fractionated into
   acetic-acid reactive and non-reactive metals. Conventional
   ``dissolved{''} samples (< 0.2 mu m) were separated into soluble (< 1
   kDa) as well as smaller (1-8 kDa) and larger (8 kDa-0.2 mu m) colloidal
   size classes. The particulate phase comprised 2\%-98\% of the total
   metal loads decreasing in the order Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Ni with
   concentrations in the 0.2-0.8 mu m fraction being generally higher than
   in the > 8.0 mu m fraction. The acid leachable fraction of the
   particulate phase increased from similar to 32\%-80\% in the order Fe <
   Cu < Ni < Zn = Mn, with larger particulates (> 8.0 mu m) being generally
   less labile than small particulates (0.2-8.0 mu m) The colloidal phase
   represented an average 4\%-96\% of the ``dissolved{''} metals, ranging
   in importance from Fe (96\%) > Cu (44\%) > Ni (25\%) > Zn (7\%) > Mn
   (4\%). Although generally small. the colloidal fraction of Zn and Mn was
   highest in a region of the bay where biomass typically is high. Changes
   in soluble and colloidal fractions along a transect through the bay
   indicate that a significant proportion of Fe, Cu and Ni were transferred
   from `'dissolved'' to particulate size fractions via colloid
   aggregation. Predicting colloidal metal concentrations from measurements
   of particulate mass (C-p) and literature values of colloid metal
   partition coefficients (K-c) underestimated the measured concentrations
   by 5-50 X. Acetic acid leachable metal concentrations in the small
   particle (0.2-8 mu m) phase correlated well with metal concentrations in
   the larger (8 kDa-0.2 mu m) colloid fraction (r = 0.91-0.99). In
   contrast, metals in the smaller colloid fraction (1-8 kDa) were for the
   most part independent of any measured parameters. Metals were not
   distributed equally between colloidal size classes; colloidal Zn was
   associated with larger colloids (> 90\%), Fe and Ni were associated
   primarily with larger colloids (similar to 70-85\%) but also with the
   smaller colloid fraction, while greater than or similar to 70\% of
   colloidal Cu was associated with smaller colloids. The non-uniform
   distribution of metals within colloidal size classes indicates that

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was isolated from surface waters of
   Delaware Bay along a transect from freshwater to the coastal ocean and
   fractionated by tangential flow ultrafiltration into high (1-30 kDa;
   HDOM) and very high (30 kDa-0.2 mu m; VHDOM) nominal molecular mass
   fractions. Carbon content, stable carbon isotopes, and lipid composition
   were measured for each DOM fraction, and particles collected in
   parallel. Lipids, excluding hydrocarbons, comprised up to 0.33\% of HDOM
   organic carbon, 1.6\% of VHDOM carbon, and 10\% of POC, the majority of
   which were fatty acids. Although lipids comprised a small fraction of
   HDOM, fatty acids and sterols provided valuable information on the
   origins of DOM. Molecular composition of particulate and dissolved
   lipids and bulk stable carbon isotopes demonstrated differences in
   organic sources along the estuarine gradient with distinct terrestrial
   signals in the river and turbid middle estuary and an algal signal in
   the lower estuary and coastal ocean. Both particulate organic matter and
   VHDOM samples were enriched in lipids on a carbon basis compared to the
   HDOM fraction, which suggests that the HDOM fraction was less labile
   than particulate organic matter or VHDOM. Selective degradation of
   labile lipids by the microbial community can account for the depletions
   of unsaturated fatty acids, sterols, and phytol within HDOM relative to
   particles. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Throughfall and soil solution chemistry were studied for 1 y in a
   tropical montane forest in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico.
   Passage of precipitation through the forest canopy resulted in an
   increase in the concentration and Bur of all solutes except H+ and NO3-.
   Throughfall chemistry showed no strong seasonal patterns, but
   concentrations of many solutes declined during weeks of high rainfall.
   Enrichment in throughfall relative to precipitation was similar to
   values reported recently for several other tropical sites, with the
   exception of NH4+, which was particularly high at this site. Based on
   net throughfall deposition of Cl-, dry deposition of marine aerosols
   appears to be a relatively minor component (c. 15\%) of total
   deposition. In soil solution, no seasonal patterns in concentration were
   evident and variability was highest for elements with high biological
   activity (especially N). Concentrations and fluxes of K+ and dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) showed the largest declines as throughfall passed
   through the soil profile; concentrations of most other elements
   increased or were relatively constant. Declining DOC flux through the
   soil profile appears to be due to sorption processes similar to those
   observed in many temperate forests. Concentrations and fluxes of HCO3-
   and SiO2, increased substantially in soil solution, but never approached
   those observed in the stream. This suggests that additional weathering
   must occur as groundwater moves from this ridgetop site to the stream.}},

Abstract = {{Hydroxyl radical (OH) is an important oxidant in atmospheric aqueous
   phases such as cloud and fog drops and water-containing aerosol
   particles. We find that numerical models nearly always overestimate
   aqueous hydroxyl radical concentrations because they overpredict its
   rate of formation and, more significantly, underpredict its sinks. To
   address this latter point, we examined OH sinks in atmospheric drops and
   aqueous particles using both new samples and an analysis of published
   data. Although the molecular composition of organic carbon, the dominant
   sink of OH, is extremely complex and poorly constrained, this sink
   behaves very similarly in different atmospheric waters and even in
   surface waters. Thus, the sink for aqueous OH can be estimated as the
   concentration of dissolved organic carbon multiplied by a general
   scavenging rate constant {[}k(C,OH) = (3.8 +/- 1.9) x 10(8) L (mol
   C)(-1) s(-1)], a simple process that should significantly improve
   estimates of OH concentrations in atmospheric drops and aqueous

Abstract = {{As a result of ubiquitous excretion by micro-organisms, extracellular
   polymeric substances are reported in high concentrations in marine
   systems. The majority of this material is exopolysaccharide (EPS).
   Despite previous studies showing that EPS can affect carbon as well as
   trace metal cycling, little is known about the effect on Fe - a critical
   nutrient limiting primary productivity in up to 40\% of the ocean. Here,
   we have characterised an EPS purified from bacteria isolated from the
   pelagic Southern Ocean (Pseudoalteromonas sp.) and investigated its role
   in Fe chemical speciation, solubility, as well as bioavailability for
   two keystone Southern Ocean phytoplankton strains. This EPS has an
   average molecular weight of 4.6 MDa, exhibiting mainly -OH. COO- and
   -NH2 functional groups. An asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation
   coupled online with UV-spectrophotometer, differential refractive index,
   and multiangle laser light scattering (aFIFFF-UV-DRI-MALS) demonstrates
   that this EPS is polydisperse with three, not well resolved, size
   populations having molar masses in the range from 0.57 to 15.8 MDa. Fe
   was exclusively associated with the medium size fraction of this EPS and
   was the most abundant trace metal with 2.2 nM Fe per nM EPS. Only a
   third of this Fe was chemically labile, and the strength of Fe-EPS
   complexes increased with equilibration time. 1 nM EPS is efficient to
   retain Fe in solution, mainly in the colloidal phase (0.02-0.2 mu m). Fe
   bound to the EPS was highly bioavailable (25\% as much as for inorganic
   Fe). Due to combined effect of EPS on Fe solubility and bioavailability,
   it can increase the residence time of bioavailable Fe in the euphotic
   zone, therefore possibly sustaining and controlling primary productivity
   in sensitive oceanic regions, such as the Southern Ocean. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Numerous studies of marine environments show that dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) concentrations in sediments are typically tenfold higher
   than in the overlying water. Large concentration gradients near the
   sediment-water interface suggest that there may be a significant flux of
   organic carbon from sediments to the water column. Furthermore,
   accumulation of DOC in the porewater may influence the burial and
   preservation of organic matter by promoting geopolymerization and/or
   adsorption reactions. We measured DOC concentration profiles (for
   porewater collected by centrifugation and ``sipping{''}) and benthic
   fluxes (with in situ and shipboard chambers) at two sites on the North
   Carolina continental slope to better understand the controls on
   porewater DOC concentrations and quantify sediment-water exchange rates.
   We also measured a suite of sediment properties (e.g., sediment
   accumulation and bioturbation rates, organic carbon content, and mineral
   surface area) that allow us to examine the relationship between
   porewater DOC concentrations and organic carbon preservation. Sediment
   depth-distributions of DOC from a downslope transect (300-1000 m water
   depth) follow a trend consistent with other porewater constituents
   (Sigma CO(2) and SO(4)(2-)) and a tracer of modern, fine-grained
   sediment (fallout Pu), suggesting that DOC levels are regulated by
   organic matter remineralization. However, remineralization rates appear
   to be relatively uniform across the sediment transect. A simple
   diagenetic model illustrates that variations in DOC profiles at this
   site may be due to differences in the depth of the active
   remineralization zone, which in turn is largely controlled by the
   intensity of bioturbation. Comparison of porewater DOC concentrations,
   organic carbon burial efficiency, and organic matter sorption suggest
   that DOC levels are nor a major factor in promoting organic matter
   preservation or loading on grain surfaces. The DOC benthic fluxes are
   difficult to detect, but suggest that only 2\% of the dissolved organic
   carbon escapes remineralization in the sediments by transport across the
   sediment-water interface. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Photochemical and microbial degradation of external inputs of dissolved

   photochemical degradation of DOM to inorganic N or P occurred in either
   the agricultural or forest runoff. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), NH4+, and PO43-, concentrations did
   not change during the photochemical experiments for any of the sources
   examined. A small, but significant increase in the NO3-/NO2- (+0.7 muM;
   p = 0.004) concentration was detected in the forest runoff, suggesting
   that a small fraction (4 to 9 \%) of the DON may be photochemically
   degraded to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Bacteria readily
   utilized DOC and DON in the agriculture and forest runoff. The percent
   of DOC and DON consumed by the bacteria ranged from 6 to 14 \% and 21 to
   25 \%, respectively. Light exposure did not alter the biological
   availability of the DOC and DON in either the equine pasture or forest
   runoff. Our results emphasize the importance of microbial processes in

   affecting the quantity and quality of the DOM exported from rivers to

   organic carbon (POC and DOG) and nitrogen (PON and DON). Production of
   POC and PON in the form of mucus has been relatively well studied, but
   very few data are available on the release of DOC and DON by corals. In
   order to investigate several aspects of carbon and nutrient cycling in
   corals, release of DOC and DON by fed and unfed colonies of the
   zooxanthellate coral Galaxea fascicularis (Linnaeus 1767) was measured
   in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Colonies were either fed
   with artemia or supplied with nitrogen- and phosphorus-enriched
   seawater. We measured DOC and DON fluxes from corals using the high
   temperature catalytic oxidation method and DOC release as
   C-14-photosynthate using a radioisotope technique. Corals released
   significant amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Two large release
   peaks were observed in mid-morning and mid-afternoon. DOC concentrations
   increased from ca 100 mu M (background level) to 300-1700 mu M,
   depending on the size of the colony and the trophic status. DON
   concentrations also increased from 15 to 120 mu M Release rates varied
   from 2-3 mu mol DOC and 0.5-0.6 mu mol DON (mg protein)(-1) d(-1) for
   the unfed colonies to 13-25 mu mol DOC and 1-3 mu mol DON (mg
   protein)(-1) d(-1) for the artemia-fed colonies to 4-6 mu mol DOC and
   0.2-1.3 mu mol DON (mg protein)(-1) d(-1) for the nutrient-enriched
   colonies. Fed corals therefore released more DOC than unfed colonies,
   but tended to conserve organic nitrogen, suggesting that heterotrophic
   nutrition may serve corals as a source of new nutrients. Calculations of
   the carbon balance for the unfed colonies showed that DOC release
   represents ca 14\% of the net daily photosynthetically fixed carbon.
   Following each peak in release, concentrations of DOM fell back to
   routine background levels. The role of free-living, epibiotic and/or
   intracellular bacteria in the uptake of DOM was therefore investigated.
   Colonies were labelled with C-14-bicarbonate and the subsequent release
   of C-14-DOM was followed in filtered seawater treated with and without
   prokaryotic inhibitors. No subsequent uptake of C-14-DOM was observed in
   the presence of inhibitors, suggesting that bacteria may play an
   important role in DOM uptake. This process may lead to tight nutrient
   recycling within coral colonies and may enable corals to thrive in
   oligotrophic waters.}},

Abstract = {{The planktonic freshwater cyanobacterium Trichormus doliolum. (Bharadw.)
   Komarek and Anagnostidis released secondary metabolites that strongly
   inhibited the growth of other cyanobacteria. The major allelopathic
   compound inhibited PS II-mediated photosynthetic electron transport. The
   allelopathic compounds were released under P-limited and replete
   exponential growth; the release of the major allelopathic compound,
   however, increased 30-fold under P-limited growth. Increased irradiance
   under P-limited growth led to elevated release of dissolved organic
   carbon, but there was no increase in release of the major allelopathic
   compound. This suggests that there are different control mechanisms for
   extracellular release of gross carbon and allelopathic secondary
   metabolices in T. doliolum. Allelopathic compounds released by T.
   doliolum grown under phosphorus limitation significantly reduced the
   growth of Anabaena variabilis even when the biomass of the latter was
   20-fold greater than that of T. doliolum. This suggests that under P
   limitation less abundant species can exert allelopathic effects on more
   abundant taxa.}},

Title = {{Global distribution of dissolved organic matter along the aquatic
   continuum: Across rivers, lakes and oceans}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{609}},
Pages = {{180-191}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Based on an extensive literature survey containing more than 12,000
   paired measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and
   absorption of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) distributed
   over four continents and seven oceans, we described the global
   distribution and transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along
   the aquatic continuum across rivers and lakes to oceans. A strong
   log-linear relationship (R-2 = 0.92) between DOC concentration and CDOM
   absorption at 350 nm was observed at a global scale, but was found to be
   ecosystem-dependent at local and regional scales. Our results reveal
   that as DOM is transported towards the oceans, the robustness of the
   observed relation decreases rapidly (R-2 from 0.94 to 0.44) indicating a
   gradual decoupling between DOC and CDOM. This likely reflects the
   decreased connectivity between the landscape and DOM along the aquatic
   continuum. To support this hypothesis, we used the DOC-specific UV
   absorbance (SUVA) to characterize the reactivity of the DOM pool which
   decreased from 4.9 to 1.7 m(2) x gC(-1) along the aquatic continuum.
   Across the continuum, a piece wise linear regression showed that the
   observed decrease of SUVA occurred more rapidly in freshwater ecosystems
   compared to marine water ecosystems, suggesting that the different
   degradation processes act preferentially on CDOM rather than carbon
   content. The observed change in the DOM characteristics along the
   aquatic continuum also suggests that the terrestrial DOM pool is
   gradually becoming less reactive, which has profound consequences on
   cycling of organic carbon in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Carbon budgets for three autotrophic Australian estuaries: Implications
   for global estimates of the coastal air-water CO2 flux}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{Estuaries are `hot spots' in the global carbon cycle, yet data on carbon
   dynamics, in particular air-sea CO2 fluxes, from autotrophic systems are
   rare. Estuarine carbon budgets were constructed for three geomorphically
   distinct warm temperate Australian estuaries over an annual cycle. All
   three estuaries were net autotrophic, with annual net ecosystem
   metabolism (NEM) ranging from 8 +/- 13.4 molC m(-2) yr(-1) to 10 +/- 14
   molC m(-2) yr(-1). There was a net flux of CO2 from the atmosphere to
   the estuaries of between 0.4 +/- 0.6 molC m(-2) yr(-1) and 2 +/- 0.9
   molC m(-2) yr(-1). Loading of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to the estuaries varied markedly within
   and between the estuaries, and was directly related to freshwater
   inflow. While NEM was similar in all three estuaries, the ratio of
   benthic versus pelagic contributions to NEM differed, with NEM dominated
   by pelagic production in the river dominated system, benthic production
   dominating in the intermediate estuary, and equal contributions of
   benthic and pelagic production in the marine dominated lagoon. All three
   estuaries exported more organic carbon than was imported, fueled by
   additional organic carbon supplied by NEM. The estuaries essentially
   acted as bioreactors, transforming DIC to organic carbon. Burial of
   organic carbon ranged from 1.2 +/- 0.3 molC m(-2) yr(-1) to 4.4 +/- 1.2
   molC m(-2) yr(-1) and represented up to half of NEM. The annual net
   uptake of atmospheric CO2 in these systems, along with previous
   estimates of the global estuarine CO2 flux being based predominantly on
   heterotrophic, large river dominated estuarine systems, indicates that
   the global estimate of the estuarine air-water CO2 flux may be
   over-estimated due to the lack of studies from autotrophic marine
   dominated estuaries.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{11359-11371}},
Abstract = {{We present the first detection of glyoxal (CHO-CHO) over the remote
   tropical Pacific Ocean in the Marine Boundary Layer (MBL). The
   measurements were conducted by means of the University of Colorado Ship
   Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (CU SMAX-DOAS)
   instrument aboard the research vessel Ronald H. Brown. The research
   vessel was on a cruise in the framework of the VAMOS
   Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study - Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx) and
   the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) projects lasting from October 2008
   through January 2009 (74 days at sea). The CU SMAX-DOAS instrument
   features a motion compensation system to characterize the pitch and roll
   of the ship and to compensate for ship movements in real time. We found
   elevated mixing ratios of up to 140 ppt CHOCHO located inside the MBL up
   to 3000 km from the continental coast over biologically active upwelling
   regions of the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean. This is surprising since
   CHOCHO is very short lived (atmospheric life time similar to 2 h) and
   highly water soluble (Henry's Law constant H = 4.2 x 10(5) M/atm). This
   CHOCHO cannot be explained by transport of it or its precursors from
   continental sources. Rather, the open ocean must be a source for CHOCHO
   to the atmosphere. Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) photochemistry in
   surface waters is a source for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) to the
   atmosphere, e. g. acetaldehyde. The extension of this mechanism to very
   soluble gases, like CHOCHO, is not straightforward since the air-sea
   flux is directed from the atmosphere into the ocean. For CHOCHO, the
   dissolved concentrations would need to be extremely high in order to
   explain our gas-phase observations by this mechanism (40-70 mu M CHOCHO,
   compared to similar to 0.01 mu M acetaldehyde and 60-70 mu M DOM).
   Further, while there is as yet no direct measurement of VOCs in our
   study area, measurements of the CHOCHO precursors isoprene, and/or
   acetylene over phytoplankton bloom areas in other parts of the oceans
   are too low (by a factor of 10-100) to explain the observed CHOCHO
   amounts. We conclude that our CHOCHO data cannot be explained by
   currently understood processes. Yet, it supports first global source
   estimates of 20 Tg/year CHOCHO from the oceans, which likely is a
   significant source of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This chemistry is
   currently not considered by atmospheric models.}},

Abstract = {{The sea-surface microlayer (SML) is the boundary layer between the ocean
   and the atmosphere. We measured bacterial production and respiration
   along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and
   phosphorus, inorganic nutrients, and dissolved amino acids in the SML
   and the underlying water (ULW) of the subtropical Atlantic gyre (SATL)
   and the western Mediterranean Sea (WMED). Dissolved amino acid
   concentrations in the SML were one order of magnitude higher than in the
   ULW. DON, ammonium, and nitrate were also significantly enriched in the
   SML as compared with the ULW. Bacterial leucine incorporation ranged
   between 3 and 50 pmol L-1 h(-1) in the SATL and 5 and 488 pmol L-1 h(-1)
   in the WMED and was generally not significantly different between the
   SML and the ULW. In contrast, bacterial respiration was significantly
   higher in the SML than in the ULW, varying between 3.6 and 9.5 mu mol
   L-1 d(-1) O-2 at both sites. The resulting bacterial growth efficiencies
   ranged between 0.1\% and 14\% using different leucine incorporation to
   carbon conversion factors. Given the high dissolved free amino acid
   (DFAA) yield of DOC (similar to 12\%) and of DON (similar to 30\%) in
   the SML, bacterial growth efficiencies in the SML were low. This
   indicates that the DFAA in the SML are not readily available for
   bacteria. The underlying mechanisms of this immobilization of DFAA in
   the SML and their production remain enigmatic.}},

Abstract = {{We tracked flows of carbon and nitrogen during an experimental
   phytoplankton bloom in a natural estuarine assemblage in Randers Fjord,
   Denmark. We used C-13-labeled dissolved inorganic carbon to trace the
   transfer of carbon from phytoplankton to bacteria. Ecosystem development
   was followed over a period of 9 d through changes in the stocks of
   inorganic nutrients, pigments, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen,
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and algal and bacterial
   polar-lipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA). We quantified the incorporation
   of C-13 in phytoplankton and bacterial biomass by carbon isotope
   analysis of specific PLFA. A dynamic model based on unbalanced algal
   growth and balanced growth of bacteria and zooplankton adequately
   reproduced the observations and provided an integral view of carbon and
   nitrogen dynamics. There were three phases with distinct carbon and
   nitrogen dynamics. During the first period, nutrients were replete, an
   algal bloom was observed, and carbon and nitrogen uptake occurred at a
   constant ratio. Because there was little algal exudation of DOC,
   transfer of C-13 from phytoplankton to bacteria was delayed by 1 d,
   compared with the labeling of phytoplankton. In the second phase, the
   exhaustion of dissolved inorganic nitrogen resulted in decoupling of
   carbon and nitrogen flows caused by unbalanced algal growth and the
   exudation of carbon-rich dissolved organic matter by phytoplankton.
   During the final, nutrient-depleted phase, carbon and nitrogen cycling
   were dominated by the microbial loop and there was accumulation of DOC.
   The main source (60\%) of DOC was exudation by phytoplankton growing
   under nitrogen limitation. Heterotrophic processes were the main source
   of dissolved organic nitrogen (94\%). Most of the carbon exudated by
   algae was respired by the bacteria and did not pass to higher trophic
   levels. The dynamic model successfully reproduced the evolution of
   trophic pathways during the transition from nutrient-replete to
   -depleted conditions, which indicates that simple models provide a
   powerful tool to study the response of pelagic ecosystems to external
   forcings.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that ultraviolet-absorbing compounds known as
   mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are not only synthesized but also
   excreted by marine phytoplankton. An experiment was performed with
   cultures of the marine dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra (previously
   known as Gonyaulax polyedra) exposed to visible (photosynthetically
   available, PAR, 400 to 700 nm) and ultraviolet (UV, 290 to 400 nm)
   radiation. Absorption properties of both particulate and dissolved
   organic matter pools (POM and DOM, respectively) showed maxima in
   ultraviolet absorption at 360 nm. Chromatographic analysis confirmed the
   presence of MAAs in both pools. Release of organic matter by L.
   polyedra, as measured spectrophotometrically by changes in UV absorption
   in the surrounding medium, showed a differential increase at 360 nm in
   cultures exposed to UV-B + PAR radiation. The changes in absorption in
   the DOM fraction were inversely proportional to intracellular UV
   absorption. Photodegradation experiments in which the DOM fraction was
   exposed to visible and UV-B radiation showed a decrease in absorption
   with dose. First-order photooxidation decay rates varied between -0.005
   and -0.26 m(2) (mol quanta)(-1) and were also a function of the initial
   optical density (OD). These results indicate that UV-absorbing compounds
   synthesized by phytoplankton, such as certain dinoflagellates, may be a
   component of the DOM pool in surface waters of the ocean and contribute
   to the attenuation of UV radiation in the water column. Photooxidation
   consumes only 3 to 10\% of the daily production of the DOM absorbing
   between 280 and 390 nm (including MAAs). This suggests that MAAs
   dissolved in seawater may contribute to the decrease of UV transmission
   through the water column on a time scale representative of phytoplankton
   growth (days) and bloom development (weeks).}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater dissolved organic matter (DOM) from different processing
   stages of a sewage treatment plant in Xiamen was characterized using
   fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. Parallel factor analysis
   modeling of excitation-emission matrix spectra revealed five fluorescent
   components occurring in sewage DOM: one protein-like (Cl), three
   humic-like (C2, C4 and C5) and one xenobiotic-like (C3) components.
   During the aerated grit chamber and primary sedimentation tank stage,
   there was only a slight decrease in fluorescence intensity and the
   absorption coefficient at 350 nm (a(350)). During the second aeration
   stage, high concentration of protein-like and short-wavelength-excited
   humic-like components were significantly degraded accompanied by
   significant loss of DOC (80\%) and a(350) (30\%), indicating that Cl and
   C2 were the dominant constituents of sewage DOM. As a result,
   long-wavelength-excited C4 and C5 became the dominant humic-like
   components and the DOM molecular size inferred from the variation of
   spectral slope S (300-650 nm) and specific absorption (a(280)/DOC)
   increased. Combination use of F-max of C 1 and the ratio of C1/C5, or
   a(350) may provide a quantitative indication for the relative amount of

Abstract = {{We examined the contribution of photoheterotrophic microbes-those
   capable of light-mediated assimilation of organic compounds-to bacterial
   production and amino acid assimilation along a transect from Florida to
   Iceland from 28 May to 9 July 2005. Bacterial production (leucine
   incorporation at a 20 nM final concentration) was on average 30\% higher
   in light than in dark-incubated samples, but the effect varied greatly
   (3\% to 60\%). To further characterize this light effect, we examined
   the abundance of potential photoheterotrophs and measured their
   contribution to bacterial production and amino acid assimilation (0.5 nM
   addition) using flow cytometry. Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were
   abundant in surface waters where light-dependent leucine incorporation
   was observed, whereas aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria were
   abundant but did not correlate with the light effect. The per-cell
   assimilation rates of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were comparable
   to or higher than those of other prokaryotes, especially in the light.
   Picoeukaryotes also took up leucine (20 nM) and other amino acids (0.5
   nM), but rates normalized to biovolume were much lower than those of
   prokaryotes. Prochlorococcus was responsible for 80\% of
   light-stimulated bacterial production and amino acid assimilation in
   surface waters south of the Azores, while Synechococcus accounted for on
   average 12\% of total assimilation. However, nearly 40\% of the
   light-stimulated leucine assimilation was not accounted for by these
   groups, suggesting that assimilation by other microbes is also affected
   by light. Our results clarify the contribution of cyanobacteria to
   photoheterotrophy and highlight the potential role of other
   photoheterotrophs in biomass production and dissolved-organic-matter
   assimilation.}},

Abstract = {{Absorption and fluorescence of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
   and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll and
   total suspended solids in Tampa Bay and its adjacent rivers were
   examined in June and October of 2004. Except in Old Tampa Bay (OTB), the
   spatial distribution of CDOM showed a conservative relationship with
   salinity in June, 2004 (a(CDOM)(400)=-0.19 x salinity+6.78, R-2=0.98,
   n=17, salinity range=1.1-32.5) with little variations in absorption
   spectral slope and fluorescence efficiency. This indicates that CDOM
   distribution was dominated by mixing. In October, 2004, CDOM
   distribution was nonconservative with an average absorption coefficient
   (a(CDOM) (400), similar to 7.76 m(-1)) about seven times higher than
   that in June (similar to 1.11 m(-1)). The nonconservative behavior was
   caused largely by CDOM removal at intermediate salinities (e.g.,
   aCDOM(400) removal > 15\% at salinity similar to 13.0), which likely
   resulted from photobleaching due to stronger stratification. The spatial
   and seasonal distributions of CDOM in Tampa Bay showed that the two
   largest rivers, the Alafia River (AR) and Hillsborough River (HR) were
   dominant CDOM sources to most of the bay. In OTB, however, CDOM showed
   distinctive differences: lower absorption coefficient, higher absorption
   spectral slopes, and lower ratios of CDOM absorption to DOC and higher
   fluorescence efficiency. These differences may have stemmed from (1)
   changes in CDOM composition by more intensive photobleaching due to the
   longer residence time of water mass in OTB; (2) other sources of CDOM
   than the HR/AR inputs, such as local creeks, streams, groundwater,
   and/or bottom re-suspension. Average CDOM absorption in Tampa Bay at 443
   nm, a(CDOM)(443), was about five times higher in June and about ten
   times higher in October than phytoplankton pigment absorption,
   a(ph)(443), indicating that blue light attenuation in the water column
   was dominated by CDOM rather than by phytoplankton absorption throughout
   the year. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is presently unclear to what extent coastal and oceanic chromophoric
   dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is remnant of diluted inputs from the
   terrestrial biosphere, is the product of in situ biological processes,
   or is a derivative of both sources. The development of a persistent
   phytoplankton thin layer (2-4 m thick) in East Sound, Washington,
   provided an opportunity to study the link between CDOM formation and in
   situ phytoplankton production. Spectral CDOM absorption a(g)(lambda),
   spectral particulate absorption a(p)(lambda), and hydrographic
   parameters were simultaneously recorded in high-resolution vertical
   profiles. Significant fine-scale variability was observed in a(g)(412).
   The majority of this fine structure covaried with salinity, consistent
   with mixing between an oceanic end member water type (low CDOM, high
   salinity) and a riverine one thigh CDOM, low salinity). During the
   development of the thin layer, deviations from this a(g)(412)-salinity
   relationship were observed. To isolate only the changes in a(g)(412)
   resulting from in situ processes, the initial state, represented by the
   a(g)(412)-salinity relationship, was subtracted from the measured
   a(g)(412). The remaining ``in situ change{''} or residual a(g)(412)
   fraction was linearly correlated with oxygen supersaturation and
   a(p)(440). Above the phytoplankton layer centered at 3-6 m the a
   residual was negative, suggesting removal by photodegradation. A
   positive a(g) residual within the thin layer is the first direct
   evidence for rapid in situ CDOM production associated with phytoplankton
   primary production. Although the in situ fraction was 10\% or less of
   the total CDOM absorption in East Sound during this period, in the open
   ocean this fraction may comprise nearly all of the absorption by
   dissolved materials.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests a key role of bacterioplankton in shaping the
   composition of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool in aquatic
   systems, not only through consumption but also through production of
   specific compounds, but the latter process is still not well understood.
   We used a bioassay approach to assess the patterns in bacterial
   production and consumption of five fluorescent DOM pools in seven lakes
   and two streams in Southeastern Quebec, Canada, and the links these
   patterns may have with key aspects of bacterial metabolism, DOM origin
   and nutrients availability. Total dissolved organic C declined by 315\%
   during these incubations, whereas the specific DOM pools had very
   different dynamics: Two humic-like fractions accumulated in all
   incubations, with rates of production increasing as a function of
   bacterial growth efficiency, which itself increased with phosphorus
   concentrations. In contrast, two protein-like fractions and a third
   humic-like fraction either increased or declined over the course of the
   experiments. The net production or consumption of these pools appeared
   to be a function of the contribution of terrestrial C to bulk DOM
   (derived from d13C of the DOM) and of total bacterial activity. Our
   results suggest that lake bacterioplankton play a dual role in DOM
   dynamics, as consumers and also producers, and that the interplay
   between DOM origin and nutrient availability appears to determine the
   net outcome of bacterial DOM processing, thus influencing the bulk DOM
   composition and its fate in these aquatic systems.}},

Abstract = {{A steady-state reaction-transport model is applied to sediments
   retrieved by gravity core from two stations (S10 and S13) in the
   Skagerrak to determine the main kinetic and thermodynamic controls on
   anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). The model considers an extended
   biomass-implicit reaction network for organic carbon degradation, which
   includes extracellular hydrolysis of macromolecular organic matter,
   fermentation, sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, AOM, acetogenesis and
   acetotrophy. Catabolic reaction rates are determined using a modified
   Monod rate expression that explicitly accounts for limitation by the in
   situ catabolic energy yields. The fraction of total sulfate reduction
   due to AOM in the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) at each site is
   calculated. The model provides an explanation for the methane tailing
   phenomenon which is observed here and in other marine sediments, whereby
   methane diffuses up from the SMTZ to the top of the core without being
   consumed. The tailing is due to bioenergetic limitation of AOM in the
   sulfate reduction zone, because the methane concentration is too low to
   engender favorable thermodynamic drive. AOM is also bioenergetically
   inhibited below the SMTZ at both sites because of high hydrogen
   concentrations (similar to 3-6 nM). The model results imply there is no
   straightforward relationship between pore water concentrations and the
   minimum catabolic energy needed to support life because of the highly
   coupled nature of the reaction network. Best model fits are obtained
   with a minimum energy for AOM of similar to 11 kJ mol(-1), which is
   within the range reported in the literature for anaerobic processes. (c)

Abstract = {{Sediment was sampled from a shallow coastal area (Knebel Vig, Denmark).
   The vertical distribution of pigments, Pb-210 and Cs-137 indicated that
   organic matter was mixed into the sediment. On an area basis, sediment
   acid hydrolyzable amino acids accounted for 24 \% of the particulate
   organic carbon pool and 53 \% of the particulate organic nitrogen pool.
   Similarly, porewater add hydrolyzable amino acids were an important
   component of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen (9
   and 27\%, respectively). It was inferred that ribonucleic acids
   potentially were an important component of dissolved organic nitrogen.
   The estimated efflux of dissolved organic nitrogen from the sediment was
   higher (3.9 mmol N m(-2) d(-1)) than the estimated efflux of dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (<2 mmol N m(-2) d(-1)). The high efflux of dissolved
   organic nitrogen was explained by organic matter hydrolysis close to the
   sediment surface. The low rates of inorganic nitrogen efflux together
   with a high carbon oxidation rate suggested degradation of organic
   matter with a low average nitrogen content and possible bacterial
   nitrogen assimilation. This was further supported by mass balance
   calculations on nitrogen incorporation into microbial biomass. The
   calculated average C/N ratio in the organic matter degraded suggested
   that only part of the sediment acid hydrolyzable amino acids were
   available for bacterial degradation. The efficiency of bacterial carbon
   incorporation was 0.33 and within the range previously encountered in
   sediments of Danish waters.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of sulphate reduction were determined in sediments from the
   eutrophic Bay of Arcachon, France. A comparison was made between
   sediment overgrown with the eelgrass Zostera noltii and unvegetated
   sediment. Rates of sulphate reduction were about twice as high in the
   root zone from 1 to 4 cm depth in the Z. noltii sediments (about 600
   nmol cm(-3) d(-1)) as compared to the activity in the equivalent layer
   of the unvegetated sediment. The sulphate reduction in the root zone was
   not stimulated by light, which in other studies with other submersed
   macrophytes has been shown to promote sulphate reduction due to
   heightened excretion of organic molecules. Furthermore, in a field
   experiment, we were not able to detect any diurnal variation in the
   activity within the root zone. The stimulation of sulphate reduction by
   the presence of the Z. noltii was most likely due to degradation of leaf
   and root fragments which were found mixed into the sediment. Incubation
   times with radioactive sulphate had to be kept very short (preferably 15
   min) to avoid a substantial reoxidation of sulphide and hence an
   underestimation of the rate of sulphate reduction.}},

   selective DOS removal and active involvement in marine biogeochemical

Abstract = {{Marine microbes have a pivotal role in the marine biogeochemical cycle
   of carbon, because they regulate the turnover of dissolved organic
   matter (DOM), one of the largest carbon reservoirs on Earth. Microbial
   communities and DOM are both highly diverse components of the ocean
   system, yet the role of microbial diversity for carbon processing
   remains thus far poorly understood. We report here results from an
   exploration of a mosaic of phytoplankton blooms induced by large-scale
   natural iron fertilization in the Southern Ocean. We show that in this
   unique ecosystem where concentrations of DOM are lowest in the global
   ocean, a patchwork of blooms is associated with diverse and distinct
   bacterial communities. By using on-board continuous cultures, we
   identify preferences in the degradation of DOM of different reactivity
   for taxa associated with contrasting blooms. We used the spatial and
   temporal variability provided by this natural laboratory to demonstrate
   that the magnitude of bacterial production is linked to the extent of
   compositional changes. Our results suggest that partitioning of the DOM
   resource could be a mechanism that structures bacterial communities with
   a positive feedback on carbon cycling. Our study, focused on bacterial
   carbon processing, highlights the potential role of diversity as a
   driving force for the cycling of biogeochemical elements.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important
   control variable in the global carbon cycle. For our understanding of
   the kinetics of organic matter cycling in the ocean, it is crucial to
   achieve a mechanistic and molecular understanding of its transformation
   processes. A long-term microbial experiment was performed to follow the
   production of non-labile DOM by marine bacteria. Two different glucose
   concentrations and dissolved algal exudates were used as substrates. We
   monitored the bacterial abundance, concentrations of dissolved and
   particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC), nutrients, amino acids and
   transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) for 2 years. The molecular
   characterization of extracted DOM was performed by ultrahigh resolution
   Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS)
   after 70 days and after similar to 2 years of incubation. Although
   glucose quickly degraded, a non-labile DOC background (5-9\% of the
   initial DOC) was generated in the glucose incubations. Only 20\% of the
   organic carbon from the algal exudate degraded within the 2 years of
   incubation. The degradation rates for the non-labile DOC background in
   the different treatments varied between 1 and 11 mol DOCL-1 year(-1).
   Transparent exopolymer particles, which are released by microorganisms,
   were produced during glucose degradation but decreased back to half of
   the maximum concentration within less than 3 weeks (degradation rate: 25
   mu g xanthan gum equivalents L-1 d(-1)) and were below detection in all
   treatments after 2 years. Additional glucose was added after 2 years to
   test whether labile substrate can promote the degradation of background
   DOC (co-metabolism; priming effect). A priming effect was not observed
   but the glucose addition led to a slight increase of background DOC. The
   molecular analysis demonstrated that DOM generated during glucose
   degradation differed appreciably from DOM transformed during the
   degradation of the algal exudates. Our results led to several
   conclusions: (i) based on our experimental setup, higher substrate
   concentration resulted in a higher concentration of non-labile DOC; (ii)
   TEP, generated by bacteria, degrade rapidly, thus limiting their
   potential contribution to carbon sequestration; (iii) the molecular
   signatures of DOM derived from algal exudates and glucose after 70 days
   of incubation differed strongly from refractory DOM. After 2 years,
   however, the molecular patterns of DOM in glucose incubations were more
   similar to deep ocean DOM whereas the degraded exudate was still
   different.}},

Abstract = {{The motile cells of chytrids were once believed to be relics from the
   time before the colonization of land by fungi. However, the majority of
   chytrids had not been found in marine but freshwater environments. We
   investigated fungal diversity by a fungal-specific PCR-based analysis of
   environmental DNA in deep-sea methane cold-seep sediments, identifying a
   total of 35 phylotypes, 12 of which were early diverging fungi (basal
   fungi, ex `lower fungi'). The basal fungi occupied a major portion of
   fungal clones. These were phylogenetically placed into a deep-branching
   clade of fungi and the LKM11 clade that was a divergent group comprised
   of only environmental clones from aquatic environments. As suggested by
   Lara and colleagues, species of the endoparasitic genus Rozella, being
   recently considered of the earliest branching taxa of fungi, were nested
   within the LKM11 clade. In the remaining 23 phylotypes identified as the
   Dikarya, the majority of which were similar to those which appeared in
   previously deep-sea studies, but also highly novel lineages associated
   with Soil Clone Group I (SCGI), Entorrhiza sp. and the agaricomycetous
   fungi were recorded. The fungi of the Dikarya may play a role in the
   biodegradation of lignin and lignin-derived materials in deep-sea,
   because the characterized fungal species related to the frequent
   phylotypes within the Dikarya have been reported to possess an ability
   to degrade lignin.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Changes in visible region (400-700 nm) absorption spectra of
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) resulting from natural
   photobleaching have not been well characterized in aquatic systems.
   Photobleaching of CDOM absorption and the resultant changes in the
   exponential spectral slope in the visible domain are documented in a
   coastal fjord. Measurements of spectral CDOM absorption were made with a
   WET Labs ac-9 in situ and in surface water incubated in UV-transparent
   Tedlar bags at 1 m for 6 days. The exponential slope of the absorption
   spectrum between 412-560 nm increased as a function of radiation dosage
   in the first 72 h of the incubations. Higher spectral slope values were
   observed in surface waters relative to bottom waters, in agreement with
   our experimental results. The extent to which a CDOM absorption spectrum
   altered by photobleaching can serve as a signature of the process
   itself, containing information about absorption loss, was investigated.
   From these observations, we propose that higher spectral slopes
   typically associated with oceanic CDOM relative to coastal CDOM may be
   due to increased cumulative photobleaching as opposed to a shift in the
   spectral signature of CDOM sources as has been hypothesized.}},

Abstract = {{Radiocarbon (Delta(14)C) and stable carbon isotopes (delta(13)C) were
   measured in total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA), total carbohydrate
   (TCHO), total lipid, and acid-insoluble organic fractions that had been
   separated from phytoplankton, zooplankton, sediment floc, and sediment
   samples from an abyssal site in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. THAA,
   TCHO, and lipid fractions accounted for 91-99\% of the total organic
   carbon (TOC) in phytoplankton and zooplankton, 57\% of TOC in sediment
   floc, and 18-38\% of TOC in sediment. Based on concentration profiles in
   sediment, first-order degradation rate constants below the bioturbation
   zone were calculated using a ``multi-G{''} model considering both labile
   and refractory organic fractions. The calculated rate constants were in
   the order THAA approximate to TCHO > TOC approximate to TN > lipid,
   indicating the relative reactivities of these compound classes in the
   sediment during early diagenesis. Bioturbation affected the
   distributions of these compound classes in the top few centimeters of
   the sediment.
   The Delta(14)C values of all organic fractions decreased in the order
   plankton in surface water to sediment floc to sediments at 4100 m depth.
   Distinct differences in Delta(14)C exist among THAA, TCHO, and lipid
   fractions in sediment flee and sediments. The lipid fraction exhibited
   lower Delta(14)C signatures than THAA and TCHO fractions. Differential
   decomposition of organic matter and sorption and/or biological
   incorporation of `old' DOC into sediment appear to be the major
   processes that likely control the observed Delta(14)C signatures and
   abundances. delta(13)C values of the organic compound classes in
   sediment are similar to their values in plankton indicating that organic
   matter input to sediment in the northeastern Pacific is mainly from
   marine sources. Also, distinct delta(13)C signatures were found in each
   of the four organic fractions. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Journal = {{ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that microbial and photochemical processing of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) determines its molecular formula composition in
   aquatic systems to a greater degree than does the original source of the
   DOM. To test this hypothesis, we exposed DOM from a leachate of a
   wetland plant (Juncus effusus) to solar radiation or incubated it in the
   dark for 1.25 yr. Analysis of the extracted DOM of the leachates via
   Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS)
   identified 2800 molecular formulae. Of the formulae in the initial DOM,
   11\% were lost during microbial decomposition in the dark and 54\% under
   solar radiation. Solar radiation also produced a large number of
   formulae containing N, that were preferentially degraded by
   microorganisms (47\% loss). We compared the ``recal-citrant formulae'',
   i.e. those not degraded in the experiment, with those of DOM from the
   deep North Pacific Ocean. Of the deep sea DOM formulae, 18\% were
   present in the recalcitrant fraction of the initial DOM. An additional
   18\% of the formulae in marine DOM were photoproduced and recalcitrant,
   and 8\% were produced by microbes in the experiment. Consequently, 44\%
   of the deep sea DOM shares identical molecular formulae with the
   recalcitrant DOM from the experiment, most of which were produced by the
   combined action of sunlight and microbes. This indicates that processes
   in the water column may be more important than the original source in
   determining the composition of bulk DOM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{148}},
Pages = {{10-21}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor
   analysis (PARAFAC) were used to characterize oil components and to
   examine their fate and transformation processes during the unprecedented
   Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Water samples were
   collected during two cruises in May and June 2010 soon after the spill
   began. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra of seawater
   samples strongly resemble those of crude oil from the Macondo well and
   weathered oil collected from Gulf surface waters. This indicates the
   influence of oil on marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) which yielded
   elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, higher UV-vis
   absorbance, and higher optically inferred molecular weight DOM in the
   water column. Two major types of DOM were found in the water column: one
   with low abundance but high optical activity and the other with high
   mass concentration yet low optical activity. Higher specific UV
   absorbance but lower spectral slope values observed for deep-water
   samples indicates the presence of less degraded or fresher crude oil in
   deep waters. Results of PARAFAC modeling revealed three oil-related
   components corresponding to crude and weathered oil in the water column:
   the most prominent one (namely C1) centered on Ex/Em 226/340 nm and the
   other two components (C2 and C6) centered on 236/360 and 252/311 nm,
   respectively. In addition, there is another DOM component (C3),
   partially representing chemically dispersed oil. Interestingly, the oil
   component ratios, an intensive property, varied with time and the
   degradation status of oil. We hypothesize that C2 (236/360 nm) is mostly
   a degraded product while C6 (252/311 nm) is a crude oil component with
   lower molecular weight, but at the same time, could be derived from oil
   degradation. Changes in fluorescence component ratios can thus be used
   as a compelling index to track the fate and transport of oil in marine
   environments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{153-167}},
Abstract = {{Concentrations of aluminium and minor metals (Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Cd,
   Ba, Pb) were measured in precipitation and surface water at two upland
   locations (Upper Duddon Valley, UDV; Great Dun Fell, GDF) in northern
   England for 1 year commencing April 1998. At both locations, the loads
   in bulk precipitation were at the lower ends of ranges reported for
   other rural and remote sites, for the period 1985-1995. The deposited
   metals were mostly in the dissolved form, and their concentrations
   tended to be greatest when rainfall volumes were low. The concentrations
   of Cu, Zn and Pb in deposition were correlated (r(2) greater than or
   equal to 0.40) with concentrations of non-marine sulphate. Three
   streams, ranging in mean pH from 5.07 to 7.07, and with mean
   concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) < 1 mg l(-1), were
   monitored at UDV, and two pools (mean pH 4.89 and 6.83, mean DOC 22 and
   15 mg l(-1)) at GDF. Aluminium and the minor metals were mainly in the
   dissolved form, and in the following ranges (means of 49-51 samples, mug
   l(-1)): Al 36-530, Mn 4.4-36, Ni 0.26-2.8, Cu 0.25-1.7, Zn 2.1-30, Cd
   0.03-0.16, Ba 1.9-140, Pb 0.10-4.5. Concentrations were generally higher
   at GDF. Differences in metal concentrations between the two locations
   and between waters at each location, and temporal variations in
   individual waters, can be explained qualitatively in terms of sorption
   to solid-phase soil organic matter and mineral surfaces, complexation
   and transport by DOC, and chemical weathering. The UDV catchments are
   sinks for Pb and sources of Al, Mn, Sr, Cd and Ba. The GDF catchments
   are sources of Al, Mn, Ni, Zn, Sr, Cd and Ba. Other metals measured at
   the two locations are approximately in balance. Comparison of
   metal:silicon ratios in the surface waters with values for silicate
   rocks indicates enrichment of Ni and Cu, and substantial enrichment of
   Zn, Cd and Pb. These enrichments, together with high metal deposition in
   the past, make it likely that concentrations of the metals in the
   surface waters are governed by release from catchment pools of
   atmospherically-deposited metal. The catchments appear to be responding
   on a time scale of decades, possibly centuries, to changes in metal
   deposition. For the more acid waters at UDV, the calculated free-ion
   concentrations of Al are similar to published LC50 values for acute
   toxicity towards fish. The free-ion concentrations of Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd
   in all the surface waters are one-to-four orders of magnitude lower than
   reported LC50 values for fish. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Carbon transformation along the Eurasian shelves in water of Atlantic
   origin is estimated. Nutrient, oxygen, and inorganic and organic carbon
   data were used in the evaluation. By comparing the relative deficit of
   the different chemical constituents it is possible to evaluate the
   transformation of carbon. It can be seen that the chemical signature in
   the shelf seas was modified extensively, corresponding to an export
   production from the upper 50 m in the Barents Sea of 28-32 g C m(-2),
   which is five times higher than that in the Kara-Laptev Seas and over
   the deep Eurasian basin. The difference in the export production,
   computed from the nutrient deficit, and the observed deficit of
   dissolved inorganic carbon is attributed air-sea exchange of CO2. With
   this approach the relative oceanic uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere was
   estimated to be 70\% (44 g C m(-2)) in the Barents Sea and 15\% (1 g C
   m(-2)) in the Kara-Laptev Seas, relative to the export production. Of
   the export production in the Barents Sea, about a quarter is found as
   DOC. The difference between the chemical signature at the Laptev Sea
   shelf slope and over the Lomonosov Ridge is negligible, which shows that
   the transformation of carbon is very small in the surface layers of the
   Eurasian basin. Combining the chemical transformation with reported
   volume transports gives an annual export production of 9.6 x 10(12) g C
   yr(-1) in the Barents Sea. The oceanic uptake of CO2 for the same area
   is 9.2 x 10(12) g C yr(-1). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The short-term variability of photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E)
   relationships and integrated primary production at 3 stations (Stns A,
   B, C in a coastal-offshore gradient) located across the Western Alboran
   Sea Gyre (SW Mediterranean) were investigated during a High Frequency
   Flux Experiment (1 to 16 May 1998). Photosynthetic production of total,
   particulate and dissolved organic carbon (TOC, POC and DOC respectively)
   was considered separatedly in 34 experiments. Photosynthetic parameters
   were calculated for TOC and POC data. For POC measurements, maximum
   photosynthetic rate (p(m)(B) (POC)) and the initial slope of the P-E
   curve (alpha) varied between 0.59 and 6.25 mg C (mg chi a)(-1) h(-1) and
   0.0023 and 0.0182 mg C (mg chi a)(-1) h(-1) (mu mol photons m(-2)
   s(-1))(-1), respectively, and were significantly correlated, showing a
   similar decrease with depth. No photoinhibition was detected at any
   depth and the light saturation parameter (E-k) was on average 251 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1), suggesting that phytoplankton assemblages were
   acclimated to high irradiance levels in the whole area. Percent
   extracellular release (PER) obtained for each experimental irradiance
   (PERE = DOC/ {[}POC+DOC]) showed an inverse relationship with irradiance
   when data from all the P-E experiments were pooled. A light-saturated
   chi a-normalized DOC production rate (P, Dec) was calculated as P-m(B)
   (TOC) - P-m(B) (POC), and PERm values calculated as P-m(B) (DOC)/P-m(B)
   (TOC) tended to increase with depth. Integrated particulate and total
   primary production varied considerably (23- and 35-fold, respectively),
   but tended to decrease along a coastal-offshore gradient. During the
   cruise, a subsurface phytoplankton bloom was advected into Stn A,
   increasing primary production rates up to 1 g C m(-2) d(-1). Average
   particulate primary production was 632 mg C m(-2) d(-1) at Stn A, 388 mg
   C m(-2) d(-1) at Stn B and 330 mg C m(-2) d(-1) at Stn C, with dissolved
   primary production ranging from 4 to 44\% of total values. integrated
   primary production was significantly correlated with surface chi a but
   not with integrated chi a. This finding has implications for the
   estimation of regional primary production based on remote sensing of
   near-surface pigments. Altogether, the results confirmed that the high
   hydrodynamism of the Alboran Sea was associated with marked biological
   variability and episodic high primary production events.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that marine bacteria utilize labile, recently
   produced components of bulk dissolved organic matter. This
   interpretation is based largely on indirect measurements using model
   compounds and plankton-derived organic matter. Here, we present an
   assessment of the relative proportions of modem and older dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) utilized by marine bacteria. Bacterial nucleic
   acids were collected from both estuarine (Santa Rosa Sound, FL) and
   open-ocean (eastern North Pacific) sites, and the natural radiocarbon
   signatures of the nucleic acid carbon in both systems were determined.
   Bacterial nucleic acids from Santa Rosa Sound were significantly
   enriched in radiocarbon with respect to the bulk DOC and were similar to
   the radiocarbon signature of atmospheric CO2 at the time of sampling,
   indicating that these bacteria exclusively assimilate a modem component
   of the estuarine bulk DOG. In contrast, bacterial nucleic acids from the
   oceanic site were enriched in C-14 relative to the bulk DOC but depleted
   in C-14 with respect to modem surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
   and suspended particulate organic carbon (POCsusp). This suggests that
   open-ocean bacteria assimilate both modem and older components of DOG.
   The distinct radiocarbon signatures of the nucleic acids at these two
   sites (i.e., +120 +/- 17\% estuarine vs. -34 +/- 24\% oceanic)
   demonstrate that natural C-14 abundance measurements of bacterial
   biomarkers are a powerful tool for investigations of carbon cycling
   through microbial communities in different aquatic systems.}},

Abstract = {{The combined impact of the burrow-dwelling polychaete, Nereis
   diversicolor, and organic enrichment with macroalgal detritus,
   Chaetomorpha linum, on sediment metabolism (CO2 production) and nutrient
   (NH4+ and NO3-) dynamics was assessed in laboratory microcosms over 35
   days with homogenized sandy (0.5\% LOI) and muddy (8.6\% LOI) sediment
   from a shallow estuary (Kertinge Nor, Denmark). In addition, the gross C
   and net N mineralization (+DOC evolution) was followed in 4 time series
   using closed anaerobic jars containing the two sediment types with and
   without organic addition. The unenriched treatments showed that the
   sandy sediment exhibited higher C and N mineralization than the muddy,
   due to a more reactive indigenous organic pool (fresh diatoms vs.
   degraded macroalgal detritus). A higher excess CO2 production due to
   enrichment in the muddy than the sandy sediment indicates a higher
   instant capacity for carbon mineralization in the former sediment. In
   contrast to the sandy, the muddy sediment had previously been exposed to
   extensive input of filamentous algae and may therefore be better adapted
   to this particular detritus type. The excess NH4+ production due to
   enrichment was highest in sandy sediment, suggesting that N was recycled
   rapidly by the microbial community of the relatively nitrogen-poor muddy
   sediment, resulting in a low net N mineralization. It also appears that
   C and N mineralization was uncoupled in sandy sediment, as indicated by
   the simultaneous initial production of DOC and NH4+ with no concomitant
   CO2 production. The presence of animals enhanced C mineralization in all
   treatments; highest in the enriched treatments. The enhancement in
   absolute rates was similar when both sediment types were enriched,
   indicating that the faunal enhancement with added detritus is
   independent of sediment type. The faunal enhancement of N
   mineralization, on the other hand, was highest in sandy sediment
   irrespective of organic enrichment. Denitrification estimates, based on
   mass balance, also appeared to be stimulated significantly by the
   presence of animals, whereas organic enrichment had a minor influence on
   this particular process. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Carbon captured by marine organisms helps sequester atmospheric CO2,
   especially in shallow coastal ecosystems, where rates of primary
   production and burial of organic carbon (OC) from multiple sources are
   high. However, linkages between the dynamics of OC derived from multiple
   sources and carbon sequestration are poorly understood. We investigated
   the origin (terrestrial, phytobenthos derived, and phytoplankton
   derived) of particulate OC (POC) and dissolved OC (DOC) in the water
   column and sedimentary OC using elemental, isotopic, and optical
   signatures in Furen Lagoon, Japan. Based on these data analysis, we
   explored how OC from multiple sources contributes to sequestration via
   storage in sediments, water column sequestration, and air-sea CO2
   exchanges, and analyzed how the contributions vary with salinity in a
   shallow seagrass meadow as well. The relative contribution of
   terrestrial POC in the water column decreased with increasing salinity,
   whereas autochthonous POC increased in the salinity range 10-30.
   Phytoplankton-derived POC dominated the water column POC (65-95\%)
   within this salinity range; however, it was minor in the sediments
   (3-29\%). In contrast, terrestrial and phytobenthos-derived POC were
   relatively minor contributors in the water column but were major
   contributors in the sediments (49-78\% and 19-36\%, respectively),
   indicating that terrestrial and phytobenthos-derived POC were
   selectively stored in the sediments. Autochthonous DOC, part of which
   can contribute to long-term carbon sequestration in the water column,
   accounted for >25\% of the total water column DOC pool in the salinity
   range 15-30. Autochthonous OC production decreased the concentration of
   dissolved inorganic carbon in the water column and thereby contributed
   to atmospheric CO2 uptake, except in the low-salinity zone. Our results
   indicate that shallow coastal ecosystems function not only as transition
   zones between land and ocean but also as carbon sequestration filters.
   They function at different timescales, depending on the salinity, and OC
   sources.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) and heterotrophic bacteria are highly
   diverse components of the ocean system, and their interactions are key
   in regulating the biogeochemical cycles of major elements. How chemical
   and phylogenetic diversity are linked remains largely unexplored to
   date. To investigate interactions between bacterial diversity and DOM,
   we followed the response of natural bacterial communities to two sources
   of phytoplankton-derived DOM over six bacterial generation times in
   continuous cultures. Analyses of total hydrolysable neutral sugars and
   amino acids, and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry revealed large
   differences in the chemical composition of the two DOM sources.
   According to 454 pyrosequences of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid genes,
   diatom-derived DOM sustained higher levels of bacterial richness,
   evenness and phylogenetic diversity than cyanobacteria-derived DOM.
   These distinct community structures were, however, not associated with
   specific taxa. Grazing pressure affected bacterial community composition
   without changing the overall pattern of bacterial diversity levels set
   by DOM. Our results demonstrate that resource composition can shape
   several facets of bacterial diversity without influencing the
   phylogenetic composition of bacterial communities, suggesting functional
   redundancy at different taxonomic levels for the degradation of
   phytoplankton-derived DOM.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the most active component in
   environmental system, and its chemical and structural characteristics
   are most likely to affect its biodegradation. DOM has several different
   fluorophores whose fluorescent characteristics contain a lot of
   information about structure and functional groups. Fluorescence
   spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared (FIR) were used to examine
   the structural and biodegradable characteristics of DOM extracted from
   fermentation effluent of swine manure slurry. Humic-like acid,
   fulvic-like acid and protein-like fluorophores were observed in
   fluorescence spectra. Fluorescence index (FI) indicated that the
   fluorophores in the samples were representative of both terrestrial and
   microbially-derived organic matter. FTIR spectroscopy showed that DOM
   featured aliphatic C H, aromatic C=C and carbohydrate C-O functional
   groups. With PARAFAC model, four fluorescent components were identified:
   component 1 (protein-like), component 2 (soluble microbial
   byproduct-like), component 3 (non-humic like) and component 4
   (fulvic-like). Component 1 was a dominant fluorescent component.
   Components 2, 3 and 4 were degraded by microorganisms as the anaerobic
   fermentation processes. The C/N ratio of DOM in F1 has a more
   significant decrease than that in F0, indicating the loss of carbon (CH4
   and CO2) during this process. The C/N ratio of DOM in F2 obviously
   increased when additional swine manure slurry was added. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The effects of infaunal mode of life on sediment properties, microbial
   reaction rates, as well as abundance and composition of bacterial
   communities were studied in sediment surrounding burrows (mucus lining,
   oxidised wall, ambient anoxic and surface sediment) of two closely
   related, but behaviourally different, nereidid polychaete worms: the
   facultative suspension-feeder Nereis (Hediste) diversicolor and the
   obligate deposit-feeder Nereis (Neanthes) virens. Burrow sediment of the
   two species was collected from two adjacent (50 m distance) shallow
   sandy locations (Kertinge Nor, Denmark). The burrow lining and wall of
   both polychaete species were enriched in organic matter originating from
   mucous secretions by the inhabitants and phytoplankton trapped through
   irrigation. This was more evident for N. diversicolor that shows a
   significantly higher irrigation rate than N. virens. Both the organic
   matter mineralisation rates (based on anaerobic incubations) and
   bacterial abundance were higher along the burrow linings and walls.
   However, accumulation of porewater TCO2 and dissolved organic carbon in
   sediments adjacent to burrows increased most rapidly in the presence of
   N. diversicolor, suggesting higher heterotrophic activity associated
   with this species. Surprisingly, bacterial abundance was lower around
   burrows of N. diversicolor than those from N. virens indicating that
   burrow environments from the first species harbour a more active
   bacterial community. Molecular fingerprints of the 16S rRNA gene from
   bacterial communities showed that the composition of the burrow linings
   and walls resembled the ambient anoxic sediment rather than the oxic
   sediment surface. On the other hand, the bacterial fingerprints of the
   sediment surrounding the burrows of the two polychaete species were
   markedly different suggesting either a site-specific difference in
   sediment parameters or a significant species-specific impact of the
   burrow inhabitants.}},

Abstract = {{The observation that a fraction of organic matter produced in marine
   systems evades the concerted efforts of microbial communities and is
   buried in sediments suggests that there are `speed bumps' in carbon
   degradation pathways that impede microbially driven remineralization
   processes. The initial step in degradation of macromolecules,
   extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis, is often stated to be `the'
   rate-limiting step in carbon remineralization. Experimental
   investigations described here, however, demonstrate that at least in
   certain cases, microbes produce extracellular enzymes on time scales of
   hours to tens of hours in response to substrate addition, and hydrolysis
   is extremely rapid. If enzymatic hydrolysis can be rapid, what factors
   slow or stop organic matter degradation? A lack of the correct inducer
   to initiate enzyme production, and/or a lack of the correct organism to
   produce the required enzyme, may result in a complete lack of hydrolysis
   in certain environments-a barricade, rather than a speed bump.
   Preliminary evidence supporting this hypothesis includes a comparison of
   polysaccharide hydrolysis in seawater and sediments, which demonstrates
   that the spectrum of enzymes active in seawater and sediments are
   fundamentally different. Furthermore, a survey of enzyme activities in
   surface waters from a range of locations suggests that pelagic microbial
   communities also differ widely in their abilities to express specific
   extracellular enzymes. Trans-membrane transport through porins is yet
   another potential location of structure-related selectivity.
   Our efforts to identify speed bumps and barricades are hampered by our
   inability to structurally characterize in sufficient detail the
   macromolecular structures present in marine systems. Furthermore,
   assessments of organic matter `quality' from a chemical perspective do
   not necessarily accurately reflect the availability of organic carbon to
   microbial communities. For these communities, in fact, `quality' may be
   a variable, which depends on the enzymatic and uptake capabilities of
   community members. To begin to assess substrate structure and quality
   from a microbial perspective, we will have to combine specific knowledge
   of macromolecular structures with detailed investigations of the
   enzymatic and transport capabilities of heterotrophic marine microbes.

Abstract = {{The impact of salinity on the composition and functional performance
   (biomass production, growth efficiency and growth rates) of bacterial
   communities was investigated using batch cultures growing on dissolved
   organic carbon from a river draining into the Northern Baltic Sea. The
   cultures were adjusted to riverine or estuarine salinity levels and
   inoculated with bacteria from these two environments. Bacterial growth
   efficiencies differed in response to salinity and the origin of the
   inoculum. When salinity was adjusted to correspond to the salinity at
   the site where the inoculum was retrieved, growth efficiency was
   relatively high (11.5 +/- 2.6\%). However, when bacteria were confronted
   with a shift in salinity, growth efficiency was lower (7.5 +/- 2.0\%)
   and more of the utilized carbon was respired. In contrast, growth rates
   were higher when bacteria were exposed to a change in salinity. The
   composition of the bacterial communities developing in the batch
   cultures differed, as shown by 16S rDNA DGGE, depending on the origin of
   the inoculum and salinity. Reverse and direct DNA-DNA hybridization
   revealed salinity optima in the growth of specific bacterial strains as
   well as broader phylogenetic groups. Strains belonging to the alpha- and
   beta-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and gamma-Proteobacteria other than
   the genus Pseudomonas showed higher relative abundance under freshwater
   conditions, whereas strains of the genus Pseudomonas and the
   Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group were favored by estuarine
   conditions. Generally, our results demonstrate functional changes
   associated with changes in community composition. We suggest that even
   moderate changes in salinity affect bacterial community composition,
   which subsequently leads to altered growth characteristics. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Natural colloids are abundant in seawater and are an intermediary in the
   fate, transport and bioavailability of many trace elements. Knowledge of
   the pathways and mechanisms of the biological uptake of colloidal Fe and
   other Fe species is of paramount importance in understanding Fe
   limitation on marine phytoplankton and thus carbon sequestration in the
   ocean. Whether the natural colloids serve as a source for the biological
   Fe requirements of marine phytoplankton, or just as a sink for
   particle-reactive metals in the oceans remains largely unknown. This
   study examined the bioavailability of Fe bound with colloids from
   different regions to a coastal diatom (Thalassiosira pseudonana).
   Natural colloids were isolated by cross-flow ultrafiltration and
   radiolabeled with (59)Fe before being exposed to phytoplankton. Control
   experiments were conducted to ensure that 59Fe radiolabeled onto the
   colloids remained mostly in the colloidal phase. Both the natural
   oceanic and coastal colloidal organic matter complexed Fe (1 nm-0.2 mum)
   can be biologically available to the marine diatom even though its
   uptake was lower than the low molecular weight counterparts. By
   comparing the measured Fe internalization fluxes and the calculated
   maximum diffusive uptake fluxes, it is evident that ligand exchange
   kinetics on the cell surface may control the internalization of
   macromolecular Fe. The calculated concentration factors under dark and
   light conditions were generally comparable. Colloidal Fe, as an
   important intermediary phase, can be actively involved in the planktonic
   food web transfer through biological uptake and regeneration processes.
   The bioavailable fraction of Fe may be substantially underestimated by
   only considering the truly dissolved Fe or overestimated when using the
   external fluxes, such as aerosol Fe, as the bioavailable fraction. (C)

Abstract = {{Runoff from small glacier systems contains dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) rich in protein-like, low molecular weight (LMW) compounds,
   designating glaciers as an important source of bioavailable carbon for
   downstream heterotrophic activity. Fluxes of DOC and particulate organic
   carbon (POC) exported from large Greenland catchments, however, remain
   unquantified, despite the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) being the largest
   source of global glacial runoff (ca. 400 km(3) yr(-1)). We report high
   and episodic fluxes of POC and DOC from a large (>600 km(2)) GrIS
   catchment during contrasting melt seasons. POC dominates organic carbon
   (OC) export (70-89\% on average), is sourced from the ice sheet bed, and
   contains a significant bioreactive component (9\% carbohydrates). A
   major source of the ``bioavailable{''} (free carbohydrate) LMW-DOC
   fraction is microbial activity on the ice sheet surface, with some
   further addition of LMW-DOC to meltwaters by biogeochemical processes at
   the ice sheet bed. The bioavailability of the exported DOC (26-53\%) to
   downstream marine microorganisms is similar to that reported from other
   glacial watersheds. Annual fluxes of DOC and free carbohydrates during
   two melt seasons were similar, despite the approximately two-fold
   difference in runoff fluxes, suggesting production-limited DOC sources.
   POC fluxes were also insensitive to an increase in seasonal runoff
   volumes, indicating a supply limitation in suspended sediment in runoff.
   Scaled to the GrIS, the combined DOC (0.13-0.17 Tg C yr(-1) (+/- 13 \%))
   and POC fluxes (mean = 0.36-1.52 Tg C yr(-1) (+/- 14 \%)) are of a
   similar order of magnitude to a large Arctic river system, and hence may
   represent an important OC source to the near-coastal North Atlantic,
   Greenland and Labrador seas.}},

Abstract = {{The photodegradation of domoic acid in model seawater containing varying
   amounts of total Fe(III) (expressed as Fe(III)), NO3-, total phosphate
   (expressed as PO43-), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) is reported. A
   multivariate, microscale, high-throughput experimental approach is
   described for evaluating how these components interact to control the
   removal of domoic acid from natural waters. Under the nominal conditions
   of the study ({[}Fe(III)](0) 0-4 mu; {[}NO3-](0) 0-35 mu M; {[}PO43-](0)
   0-4 mu M; {[}DOM](0) 0-10 mg/L), it is apparent that Fe(III) and DOM are
   significant promoters of domoic acid photooxidation. In contrast, PO43-
   interacts with Fe(III) to inhibit the photooxidation of domoic acid, but
   PO43- alone does not act to slow or accelerate domoic acid
   photodegradation. No other variables (singly or interactively) have a
   statistically significant impact. At an incident light intensity of 765
   W/m(2) and initial domoic acid concentration of 0.96 mu M, domoic acid
   half-lives range over 12-36 h, with half-life a function of {[}Fe(Ill)],
   {[}PO43-], and dissolved organic matter loadings. An NMR based technique
   for measuring domoic acid-Fe(III) binding (1.72 x 10(11)) is reported.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 19}},
Abstract = {{Sinking particles mediate the transport of carbon and energy to the
   deep-sea, yet the specific microbes associated with sedimenting
   particles in the ocean's interior remain largely uncharacterized. In
   this study, we used particle interceptor traps (PITs) to assess the
   nature of particle-associated microbial communities collected at a
   variety of depths in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Comparative
   metagenomics was used to assess differences in microbial taxa and
   functional gene repertoires in PITs containing a preservative (poisoned
   traps) compared to preservative-free traps where growth was allowed to
   continue in situ (live traps). Live trap microbial communities shared
   taxonomic and functional similarities with bacteria previously reported
   to be enriched in dissolved organic matter (DOM) microcosms (e.g.,
   Alteromonas and Methylophaga), in addition to other particle and
   eukaryote-associated bacteria (e.g., Flavobacteriales and
   Pseudoalteromonas). Poisoned trap microbial assemblages were enriched in
   Vibrio and Campylobacterales likely associated with eukaryotic surfaces
   and intestinal tracts as symbionts, pathogens, or saprophytes. The
   functional gene content of microbial assemblages in poisoned traps
   included a variety of genes involved in virulence, anaerobic metabolism,
   attachment to chitinaceaous surfaces, and chitin degradation. The
   presence of chitinaceaous surfaces was also accompanied by the
   co-existence of bacteria which encoded the capacity to attach to,
   transport and metabolize chitin and its derivatives. Distinctly
   different microbial assemblages predominated in live traps, which were
   largely represented by copiotrophs and eukaryote-associated bacterial
   communities. Predominant sediment trap-assocaited eukaryotic phyla
   included Dinoflagellata, Metazoa (mostly copepods), Protalveolata,
   Retaria, and Stramenopiles. These data indicate the central role of
   eukaryotic taxa in structuring sinking particle microbial assemblages,
   as well as the rapid responses of indigenous microbial species in the
   degradation of marine particulate organic matter (POM) in situ in the
   ocean's interior.}},

Abstract = {{Sunlight-initiated photolysis of chromophoric dissolved organic matter
   (CDOM) is the dominant source of carbon monoxide (CO) in the open-ocean.
   A modelling study was conducted to constrain this source. Spectral solar
   irradiance was obtained from two models (GCSOLAR and SMARTS2).
   Water-column CDOM and total light absorption were modelled using spectra
   collected along a Meridional transect of the Atlantic ocean using a
   200-cm pathlength liquid waveguide UV-visible spectrophotometer.
   Apparent quantum yields for the production of CO (AQY(CO)) from CDOM
   were obtained from a parameterisation describing the relationship
   between CDOM light absorption coefficient and AQYCo and the CDOM spectra
   collected. The sensitivity of predicted rates to variations in model
   parameters (solar irradiance, cloud cover, surface-water reflectance,
   CDOM and whole water light absorbance, and AQY(CO)) was assessed. The
   model's best estimate of open-ocean CO photoproduction was 47 +/- 7 Tg
   CO-C yr(-1), with lower and upper limits of 38 and 84 Tg CO-C yr(-1), as
   indicated by sensitivity analysis considering variations in AQYs, CDOM
   absorbance, and spectral irradiance. These results represent significant
   constraint of open-ocean CO photoproduction at the lower limit of
   previous estimates. Based on these results, and their extrapolation to
   total photochemical organic carbon mineralisation, we recommend a
   downsizing of the role of photochemistry in the open-ocean carbon cycle.

Title = {{Universal molecular structures in natural dissolved organic matter}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) comprises a broad range of
   dissolved organic molecules in aquatic systems and is among the most
   complex molecular mixtures known. Here we show, by comparing detailed
   structural fingerprints of individual molecular formulae in DOM from a
   set of four marine and one freshwater environments, that a major
   component of DOM is molecularly indistinguishable in these diverse
   samples. Molecular conformity was not only apparent by the co-occurrence
   of thousands of identical molecular formulae, but also by identical
   structural features of those isomers that collectively represent a
   molecular formula. The presence of a large pool of compounds with
   identical structural features in DOM is likely the result of a cascade
   of degradation processes or common synthetic pathways that ultimately
   lead to the formation of a universal background, regardless of origin
   and history of the organic material. This novel insight impacts our
   understanding of long-term turnover of DOM as the underlying mechanisms
   are possibly universal.}},

Abstract = {{Microplastics and sulfamethoxazole coexist ubiquitously in the marine
   environment, and microplastics tend to sorb organic pollutants from the
   surrounding environment. Here, the sorption kinetics and isotherms of
   sulfamethoxazole on polyethylene (PE) microplastics closely fitted a
   pseudo-second-order model (R-2 = 0.98) and linear model (R-2 = 0.99),
   respectively, indicating that the sorption process was
   partition-dominant interaction. The main binding mechanism was possibly
   the van der Waals interaction for hydrophilic sulfamethoxazole onto
   hydrophobic PE microplastics. The effects of pH, dissolved organic
   matter and salinity on sorption behavior were also studied. The sorption
   behavior of sulfamethoxazole on PE microplastics was not significantly
   influenced by pH and salinity, probably because the electrostatic
   repulsion played a minor role. In addition, the negligible effect of
   dissolved organic matter was attributed to the greater affinity of
   sulfamethoxazole to PE microplastics than to dissolved organic matter.
   Our results demonstrated that PE microplastics may serve as a carrier
   for sulfamethoxazole in the aquatic environment.}},

Abstract = {{Given the pace of climate change, it is important to better understand
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) storage and cycling in high-latitude
   rivers and its subsequent export to the Arctic Ocean. To address this
   concern, excitation/emission matrix spectroscopy and parallel factor
   analysis (PARAFAC) coupled with optical indices were used to
   characterize the optical properties of fluorescent DOM (FDOM) and
   colored DOM (CDOM) in five large Arctic rivers over two seasonal cycles.
   Five PARAFAC components were identified and proved useful indicators for
   the quantitative and qualitative descriptions of DOM sources and
   modification processes within Arctic watersheds. In comparing Pan-Arctic
   relationships between the optical properties and chemical properties of
   DOM, three components traced terrigenous biomarkers and two components
   are introduced as potential indicators for microbial processing.
   Conversely, no individual PARAFAC component could be directly linked to
   a specific plant source or river and simpler absorbance indices (i.e.,
   a(350)) proved to be better suited to quantify dissolved organic carbon
   and lignin phenol concentrations. Differences in FDOM character between
   the rivers could be explained by general watershed characteristics,
   including vegetation, topography, and hydrology. Based on these
   differences, the influence of coniferous vegetation on DOM character is
   most apparent in the Lena and Yenisei Rivers and bog-derived FDOM
   sources are more important in the Ob River. This study illustrates how
   increased hydrological connectivity in the Ob catchment and the
   abundance of lakes within the Mackenzie watershed may influence FDOM
   concentrations and the microbial processing of DOM within these
   watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{The optical characteristics, of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
   were analyzed in the Great Whale River and adjacent Hudson Bay (55
   degrees N, 77 degrees W) in the eastern Canadian Low Arctic, and in the
   Mackenzie River and adjacent Beaufort Sea in the western Canadian High
   Arctic (70 degrees N, 133 degrees W). Sampling was during ice-free open
   water conditions. Both rivers contained high concentrations of dissolved
   organic carbon (3 and 6 mg DOC l(-1) in the Great Whale River and
   Mackenzie River, respectively) and CDOM (a(320) of 11 and 14 m(-1)),
   resulting in a substantial load of organic matter to their coastal seas.
   There were pronounced differences in the CDOM characteristics of the two
   rivers, notably in their synchronous fluorescence scans (SFS). The
   latter showed that the Mackenzie River was depleted in humic materials,
   implying a more mature catchment relative to the younger, more recently
   glaciated Great Whale River system. SFS spectra had a similar shape
   across the freshwater-saltwater transition zone of the Great Whale
   plume, and DOC was linearly related to salinity implying conservative
   mixing and no loss by flocculation or biological processes across the
   salt front. In contrast, there were major differences in SFS spectral
   shape from the Mackenzie River to the freshwater-influenced coastal
   ocean, with a marked decrease in the relative importance of fulvic and
   humic acid materials. The SFS spectra for the coastal Beaufort Sea in
   September-October strongly resembled those recorded for the Mackenzie
   River during the high discharge, CDOM-rich, snowmelt period in June, but
   with some loss of autochthonous materials. These results are consistent
   with differences in freshwater residence time between the Mackenzie
   River and Great Whale River coastal ocean systems. Models of arctic
   continental shelf responses to present and future climate regimes will
   need to consider these striking regional differences in the organic
   matter content, biogeochemistry and optics between waters from different
   catchments and different inshore hydrodynamic regimes. (c) 2006 Elsevier

   1\% and 9\% (mean, 2.3\%) of total bacteria. Mean abundances in October

Abstract = {{C-14-labeled extracellular products of a natural microphytobenthic
   community and two species of benthic diatoms (Nitzschia hybridaeformis
   and Amphora coffeaeformis) were fractionated into extracellular
   dissolved organic carbon (C-14-EDOC), organic carbon extracted with EDTA
   (C-14- EDTA-extractable OC) and extracellular polymeric substances
   (C-14-EPS). The biodegradation of this labeled extracellular organic
   carbon by bacteria in sediments was examined to determine the processes
   of enzymatic degradation of photosynthetically-produced extracellular
   organic carbon from microphytobenthos in an intertidal flat ecosystem.
   In addition, primary production as well as extracellular enzyme
   activities (beta- and alpha -glucosidase) were measured to evaluate the
   possible relationship between organic carbon production and
   microbiological degradation at the Isshiki intertidal flat in Mikawa
   Bay, Japan. With all three C-14-fractions extracted from a natural
   microphytobenthic assemblage and two species of benthic diatoms, more
   than 50\% of the added substrates were mineralized within 24 h by the
   bacterial community in sediments. At that time, the percentage of
   high-molecular-weight compounds (>5 K MW) to total MW compounds of
   C-14-EDTA-extractable OC and C-14-EPS fractions decreased within 24 h
   from 50.9 to 6.6\% and 74.5 to 11.1\%, respectively. In situ, beta- and
   alpha -glucosidase activity in sediment was higher than in the seawater
   column (at a depth of 1 m), though the photosynthetic production of
   microphytobenthos was equal to that of phytoplankton. Based on our
   previous studies that microphytobenthos produced much more extracellular
   products than phytoplankton, it is assumed from these results that
   carbon flowing into the microbial loop through the mediation of
   enzymatic degradation of extracellular products in a benthic system
   exceeds that in the overlying water column. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The effect of surface solar radiation on the optical properties and the
   biological availability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its humic
   and nonhumic component was investigated in the northern Adriatic Sea (44
   degrees 52'N 13 degrees 52'E) and the coastal North Sea (53 degrees 00'N
   4 degrees 45'E). In the northern Adriatic Sea, humic substances of
   primarily autochthonous origin contributed, on average, 15\% to the bulk
   DOC, whereas in the coastal North Sea the mean contribution of the
   mainly terrestrially derived humic substances to the bulk DOC was about
   43\%. DOC-normalized absorbance and fluorescence were both similar to
   1.5-fold higher and the absorbance ratio 250:365 nm was twofold higher
   for the humic DOC of the northern Adriatic Sea as compared to the
   coastal North Sea. Bioassay experiments with indigenous bacterioplankton
   indicated a similar to 5 times higher DOC-normalized bacterial growth on
   the humic and nonhumic DOC from the northern Adriatic Sea as compared to
   the corresponding fractions from the coastal North Sea. Exposure of the
   different DOC fractions to surface solar radiation for 5-8 h and
   subsequent inoculation with a natural bacterial community resulted in
   stimulated bacterial growth on the preexposed humic and nonhumic DOC by
   35 and 45\%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding dark
   controls for the northern adriatic Sea, whereas in the coastal North Sea
   stimulated bacterial growth (by 50\%) was found only for the humic DOC.
   The increase in the DOC bioavailability upon irradiation was linearly
   related to a decrease in the absorbance and an increase in the
   absorbance ratio 250:365 nm. Both DOC-normalized photochemical and
   bacterial oxygen demand of surface water were, on average, about tenfold
   higher in the northern Adriatic Sea as compared to the coastal North
   Sea.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is increasingly clear that picoplankton play a major role in
   the oceanic carbon cycle, relatively little is known concerning the
   significance of picoplankton in coastal systems subject to significant
   environmental variance on tidal to interannual scales. Here we report on
   seasonal and interannual patterns of variability in the productivity and
   biomass of phototrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton (P- and H-PICO,
   respectively) and on the flow of carbon from phytoplankton to H-PICO.
   Annual cycles in the biomass and productivity of both picoplankton
   trophic levels exhibit winter-spring minima and summer maxima but do not
   appear to be directly coupled in terms of carbon flow from P- to H-PICO.
   H-PICO exceeds P-PICO during spring when picoplankton productivity is
   low, and P-PICO exceeds H-PICO during summer when productivity is high.
   P-PICO productivity and biomass increase rapidly each year to an early
   summer peak (20\% of total phytoplankton productivity on average)
   immediately following the collapse of the spring diatom bloom. In
   contrast, H-PICO productivity and the abundance of bacterioplankton (the
   predominant group of H-PICO) increase slowly to a late summer peak
   (equivalent to 16\% of phytoplankton productivity on average). Recently
   released phytoplankton exudates are a major source of dissolved organic
   carbon with H-PICO taking up an average of 54\% during spring and 83\%
   during summer. Variations in H-PICO are closely coupled to the release
   of DOC, most of which is produced by phytoplankton > 2-mu-m. New
   nutrient input to the Bay appears to be coupled to H-PICO productivity
   via increases in the productivity and DOC release of phytoplankton >
   2-mu-m in size.}},

Journal = {{QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Lignin has been analysed as a proxy for vegetation change in the
   Quaternary science literature since the early 1990s in archives such as
   peat, lakes, and intertidal and marine sediment cores. Historically, it
   has been regarded as comparatively resistant to various types of
   degradation in comparison to other plant components. However, studies of
   modern biogeochemical processes affecting organic carbon have
   demonstrated significant degradation and alteration of lignin as it is
   transported through the terrestrial biosphere, including phase changes
   from particulate to dissolved organic matter, mineral binding and decay
   due to biotic and abiotic processes. The literature of such topics is
   vast, however it is not particularly useful to Quaternary research
   without a comprehensive review to link our understanding of modern
   processes involving lignin to Quaternary environments. This review will
   outline the current state of the art in lignin phenol research that is
   relevant to the Quaternary scientist, and highlight the potential future
   applications for this important biomarker for vegetation change and
   terrestrial organic carbon cycling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A physically based framework for modeling the organic fractionation of
   sea spray aerosol from bubble film Langmuir equilibria}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{13601-13629}},
Abstract = {{The presence of a large fraction of organic matter in primary sea spray
   aerosol (SSA) can strongly affect its cloud condensation nuclei activity
   and interactions with marine clouds. Global climate models require new
   parameterizations of the SSA composition in order to improve the
   representation of these processes. Existing proposals for such a
   parameterization use remotely sensed chlorophyll a concentrations as a
   proxy for the biogenic contribution to the aerosol. However, both
   observations and theoretical considerations suggest that existing
   relationships with chlorophyll a, derived from observations at only a
   few locations, may not be representative for all ocean regions.
   We introduce a novel framework for parameterizing the fractionation of
   marine organic matter into SSA based on a competitive Langmuir
   adsorption equilibrium at bubble surfaces. Marine organic matter is
   partitioned into classes with differing molecular weights, surface
   excesses, and Langmuir adsorption parameters. The classes include a
   lipid-like mixture associated with labile dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), a polysaccharide-like mixture associated primarily with
   semi-labile DOC, a protein-like mixture with concentrations intermediate
   between lipids and polysaccharides, a processed mixture associated with
   recalcitrant surface DOC, and a deep abyssal humic-like mixture.
   Box model calculations have been performed for several cases of organic
   adsorption to illustrate the underlying concepts. We then apply the
   framework to output from a global marine biogeochemistry model, by
   partitioning total dissolved organic carbon into several classes of
   macromolecules. Each class is represented by model compounds with
   physical and chemical properties based on existing laboratory data. This
   allows us to globally map the predicted organic mass fraction of the
   nascent submicron sea spray aerosol.
   Predicted relationships between chlorophyll a and organic fraction are
   similar to existing empirical parameterizations, but can vary between
   biologically productive and nonproductive regions, and seasonally within
   a given region. Major uncertainties include the bubble film thickness at
   bursting, and the variability of organic surfactant activity in the
   ocean, which is poorly constrained. In addition, polysaccharides may
   enter the aerosol more efficiently than Langmuir adsorption would
   suggest. Potential mechanisms for enrichment of polysaccharides in sea
   spray include the formation of marine colloidal particles that may be
   more efficiently swept up by rising bubbles, and cooperative adsorption
   of polysaccharides with proteins or lipids. These processes may make
   important contributions to the aerosol, but are not included here.
   This organic fractionation framework is an initial step towards a closer
   linking of ocean biogeochemistry and aerosol chemical composition in
   Earth system models. Future work should focus on improving constraints
   on model parameters through new laboratory experiments or through
   empirical fitting to observed relationships in the real ocean and
   atmosphere, as well as on atmospheric implications of the variable
   composition of organic matter in sea spray.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) is one of the major water resources in
   Israel. The origin and characteristics of natural organic matter (NOM)
   in the lake and its tributary rivers were studied using fluorescence
   excitation emission matrices (EEM) and parallel factor analysis. Two
   humic-like and one proteinous components were sufficient to describe EEM
   variability among 167 water samples collected between 2/2005 and 9/2006.
   The two humic-like components showed different relations in lake and
   riverine samples. Their vertical distribution in the lake was affected
   by seasonal stratification and distance from water surface, presumably
   reflecting the release of humic-like matter from sediments, its
   production via NOM transformation in the bottom layers, and its
   photodegradation in the upper layers. Vertical distribution of the
   proteinous component, indicating biological activity at upper water
   layers, did not correlate with that of the humic-like components.
   Dissolved organic carbon concentrations did not show any vertical
   stratification, emphasizing the power of EEM to explore NOM dynamics.

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{36}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Volatile organoiodine compounds (VOIs) are the main carrier of iodine
   from the oceans to the atmosphere. We have identified a novel,
   sea-surface source of the short-lived VOIs CH2I2, CHClI2 and CHI3 in a
   series of laboratory experiments. These compounds were formed when
   seawater, collected during winter in the North Sea, was exposed to
   ambient levels of ozone. The VOIs are produced from the reaction of
   marine dissolved organic matter with hypoiodous acid/molecular iodine,
   which are formed at the sea surface when ozone reacts with dissolved
   iodide. The same three VOIs were formed when we incubated seawater of
   different productivity levels with molecular iodine during a cruise in
   the tropical Atlantic Ocean. We suggest that the presence of dissolved
   iodide, dissolved organic matter and ozone can lead to the sea-surface
   production of CH2I2, CHClI2 and CHI3. As such, this process could
   provide a ubiquitous source of iodine to the marine atmosphere.

Abstract = {{We examined the utility of delta O-18(2) measurements in estimating
   gross primary production (P), community respiration (R), and net
   metabolism (P : R) through diel cycles in a productive agricultural
   stream located in the midwestern U. S. A. Large diel swings in O-2 (+/-
   200 mu mol L-1) were accompanied by large diel variation in delta
   O-18(2) (+/- 10\%(0)). Simultaneous gas transfer measurements and
   laboratory- derived isotopic fractionation factors for O-2 during
   respiration (alpha(r)) were used in conjunction with the diel monitoring
   of O2 and delta O-18(2) to calculate P, R, and P : R using three
   independent isotope- based methods. These estimates were compared to
   each other and against the traditional ``open-channel diel O-2-change''
   technique that lacked delta O-18(2). A principal advantage of the delta
   O-18(2) measurements was quantification of diel variation in R, which
   increased by up to 30\% during the day, and the diel pattern in R was
   variable and not necessarily predictable from assumed temperature
   effects on R. The P, R, and P : R estimates calculated using the
   isotope- based approaches showed high sensitivity to the assumed system
   fractionation factor (alpha r). The optimum modeled ar values (0.986 -
   0.989) were roughly consistent with the laboratory-derived values, but
   larger (i. e., less fractionation) than ar values typically reported for
   enzyme- limited respiration in open water environments. Because of large
   diel variation in O-2, P : R could not be estimated by directly applying
   the typical steady- state solution to the O2 and O-18-O-2 mass balance
   equations in the absence of gas transfer data. Instead, our results
   indicate that a modified steady- state solution (the daily mean value
   approach) could be used with time- averaged O-2 and delta O-18(2)
   measurements to calculate P : R independent of gas transfer. This
   approach was applicable under specifically defined, net heterotrophic
   conditions. The diel cycle of increasing daytime R and decreasing
   nighttime R was only partially explained by temperature variation, but
   could be consistent with the diel production/ consumption of labile
   dissolved organic carbon from photosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Plant pigments in particulate organic carbon were examined in the lower
   Mississippi and Pearl Rivers (U.S.), along with physical variables and
   nutrients to study seasonal changes in the abundance and composition of
   phytoplankton. Water samples were collected monthly from September 2001
   to August 2003 in the lower Mississippi River (MR; no samples were taken
   in February 2002) and from August 2001 to July 2003 in the Pearl River
   (PR). High concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS), nutrients,
   and chlorophyll a (chl a; dominated by diatoms) were observed in the
   lower MR. The smaller blackwater PR was characterized by lower nutrients
   and chl a, higher ultraviolet absorbance, and a phytoplankton biomass
   dominated by chlorophytes. Chl a concentrations in the lower MR was high
   in summer low-flow periods and also during interims of winter and
   spring, and did not couple with physical variables and nutrients, likely
   due to a combination of in situ production and inputs from reservoirs,
   navigation locks, and oxbow lakes in the upper MR and Missouri River.
   Chl a concentrations in the PR was only high in summer low-flow periods
   and were controlled by temperature and concentrations of chromophoric
   dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The high, diatom-dominated
   phytoplankton biomass in the lower MR was likely the result of
   decreasing TSS (increased damming in the watershed) and increasing
   nutrients (enhanced agricultural runoff) over the past few decades.
   Lower phytoplankton biomass (dominated by chlorophytes) in the PR was
   likely linked with intense shading by CDOM and lower availability of
   nutrient inputs. An increase in the relative importance of phytoplankton
   biomass in large turbid rivers, such as the MR, could have significant
   effects on the age and lability of riverine organic matter entering the
   ocean, the stoichiometric balance of nutrients delivered to coastal
   margins, and the sequestration of atmospheric CO(2) in these dynamic
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been observed in significant concentrations
   in many natural waters. Because hydrogen peroxide can act as an oxidant
   and reductant, it participates in an extensive suite of reactions in
   surface waters. Hydrogen peroxide is produced as a secondary
   photochemical product of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
   photolysis. Apparent quantum yields for the photochemical production of
   hydrogen peroxide were determined in laboratory irradiations of filtered
   surface waters from several locations in the Chesapeake Bay and in
   Arctic coastal waters with varying levels of CDOM. The apparent quantum
   yield for H2O2 decreases by about an order of magnitude from 280 nm to
   500 nm, and the majority of H2O2 production occurs at wavelengths less
   than 340 nm. The apparent quantum yield for H2O2 production at 290 nm
   ranged from 4.2 x 10(-4) to 2.1 X 10(-6) mol H2O2 (mol photons)(-1) from
   freshwater to marine waters. A linear relationship was found between the
   production of H2O2 and change in CDOM absorbance characterized as
   photobleaching (loss of absorbance). No significant relationship was
   observed between DOC concentration and peroxide production.
   Methylhydroperoxide (CH3O2H) was the only short chain peroxide produced
   during the irradiations, and its production is at least an order
   magnitude less than that of hydrogen peroxide. Peroxide production was
   greatest in waters containing significant amounts of terrigenous C in
   the form of humic substances. Surface waters whose synchronous
   fluorescence spectra indicated the presence of polyaromatic and/ or
   extensive conjugated compounds exhibited the greatest peroxide
   production. CDOM photobleaching is not significantly linked to apparent
   quantum yields for peroxide production. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Initial rates (30-60 days) and C:N stoichiometry of decomposition were
   examined in an organic-poor sediment (0.5\% LOI) amended with fresh and
   dried yeast (Y) and Ruppia maritima (R) detritus by the use of `'open
   system'' core incubations and `'closed system'' jar incubations. High
   organic additions (0.5\% dw) inhibited anaerobic carbon mineralization
   (i.e. sulfate reduction) and stimulated DOC production and nitrogen
   mineralization 3(R) to 15(Y) times (i.e. hydrolysis and fermentation).
   This indicated that carbon and nitrogen mineralization in the highly
   amended anaerobic sediments were uncoupled. Low organic additions
   (0.08\% dw), on the other hand, stimulated both carbon and nitrogen
   mineralization by 1-2(R) and 3(Y) times. The comparison of reaction
   rates involving CO2, SO42- and NH4+ estimated from (1) modeling of
   porewater profiles (''open system''), (2) temporal changes in jars
   (''closed system'') and (3) sediment-water fluxes, documented equal
   applicability of these techniques in non-bioturbated sediment (except
   for NH4+ in (3) where nitrification interfered). The modeling approach
   (1) also suggested that the TCO2 deficiency observed in the uppermost
   oxidized zone of the sediment can be explained by rapid CO2 fixation by
   e.g. sulfide oxidizing chemoautotrophs. Although the C:N stoichiometry
   of inorganic decomposition products based on estimate (1) and (2)
   generally agreed well, it was found crucial to include dissolved organic
   pools (i.e. DOG) in estimates from highly amended anaerobic sediments
   due to the uncoupling of carbon and nitrogen mineralization. The
   stoichiometry of inorganic mineralization products can only be used to
   describe particulate organic matter decay in sediments where the
   concentration of DOC is negligible. C:N ratios obtained in the present
   study indicated that the major compounds being degraded in unamended
   (with an indigenous diatom pool) and yeast amended sediment were
   proteins (C:N = 4-5), whereas in Ruppia amended sediment carbohydrates
   were more important (C:N = 6-9).}},

Abstract = {{The marine shelf areas in subtropical and tropical regions represent
   only 35\% of the total shelf areas globally, but receive a
   disproportionately large amount of water (65\%) and sediment (58\%)
   discharges that enter such environments. Small rivers and/or streams
   that drain the mountainous areas in these climatic zones deliver the
   majority of the sediment and nutrient inputs to these narrow shelf
   environments; such inputs often occur as discrete, episodic
   introductions associated with storm events. To gain insight into the
   linked biogeochemical behavior of subtropical/tropical mountainous
   watershed-coastal ocean ecosystems, this work describes the use of a
   buoy system to monitor autonomously water quality responses to
   land-derived nutrient inputs and physical forcing associated with local
   storm events in the coastal ocean of southern Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii,
   USA. The data represent 2.5 years of near-real time observations at a
   fixed station, collected concurrently with spatially distributed
   synoptic sampling over larger sections of Kaneohe Bay. Storm events
   cause most of the fluvial nutrient, particulate, and dissolved organic
   carbon inputs to Kaneohe Bay. Nutrient loadings from direct rainfall
   and/or terrestrial runoff produce an immediate increase in the N:P ratio
   of bay waters up to values of 48 and drive phytoplankton biomass growth.
   Rapid uptake of such nutrient subsidies by phytoplankton causes rapid
   declines of N levels, return to N-limited conditions, and subsequent
   decline of phytoplankton biomass over timescales ranging from a few days
   to several weeks, depending on conditions and proximity to the sources
   of runoff. The enhanced productivity may promote the drawing down of
   pCO(2) and lowering of surface water column carbonate saturation states,
   and in some events, a temporary shift from N to P limitation. The
   productivity-driven CO2 drawdown may temporarily lead to air-to-sea
   transfer of atmospheric CO2 in a system that is on an annual basis a
   source of CO2 to the atmosphere due to calcification and perhaps
   heterotrophy. Storms may also strongly affect proximal coastal zone
   pCO(2) and hence carbonate saturation state due to river runoff flushing
   out high pCO(2) soil and ground waters. Mixing of the CO2-charged water
   with seawater causes a salting out effect that releases CO2 to the
   atmosphere. Many subtropical and tropical systems throughout the Pacific
   region are similar to Kaneohe Bay, and our work provides an important
   indication of the variability and range of CO2 dynamics that are likely
   to exist elsewhere. Such variability must be taken into account in any
   analysis of the direction and magnitude of the air-sea CO2 exchange for
   the integrated coastal ocean, proximal and distal. It cannot be
   overemphasized that this research illustrates several examples of how
   high frequency sampling by a moored autonomous system can provide
   details about ecosystem responses to stochastic atmospheric forcing that
   are commonly missed by traditional synoptic observational approaches.
   Finally, the work exemplifies the utility of combining synoptic sampling
   and real-time autonomous observations to elucidate the biogeochemical
   and physical responses of coastal subtropical/tropical coral reef
   ecosystems to climatic perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{The time course of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption
   and fluorescence were monitored during 50 to 70 days of laboratory
   incubations with water collected in the coastal upwelling system of the
   Ria de Vigo (NW Iberian Peninsula) under contrasting hydrographic
   conditions. CDOM fluorescence at peak-T (Ex/Em, 280/350 nm),
   characteristic of protein-like materials, decayed at a 1st order
   degradation rate constant (k(T)) of 0.28 +/- 0.13 day(-1) (average +/-
   SD). k(T) covaried (R(2) = 0.86, p<0.0002) with the degradation rate of
   the bulk DOC (k(DOC)), but the protein-like materials degraded 72 +/-
   23\% faster than DOC. Therefore, this study confirms that the CDOM
   fluorescence at peak-T can be used as a proxy to a DOM fraction
   significantly more labile than the bulk bioavailable DOC. In parallel
   with the decay of DOC and protein-like fluorescence, an increase in CDOM
   fluorescence at peak-M (Ex/Em, 320/410 nm) during the course of the
   incubations verified the production of marine humic-like substances as a
   by-product of the microbial metabolism. CDOM fluorescence at peak-M
   built-up at a production rate (k(M)) of 0.06 +/- 0.01 day(-1) (average
   SD) in the Ria de Vigo. Furthermore, the slope of the linear regression
   between k(DOC) and k(M) (R(2) = 0.64, p<0.001) revealed that the
   formation of marine humic-like substances occurred at about one fifth of
   the rate of net DOC consumption. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The long-term burial of organic carbon in sediments results in the net
   accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere, thereby mediating the redox
   state of the Earth's biosphere and atmosphere. Sediment microbial
   activity plays a major role in determining whether particulate organic
   carbon is recycled or buried. A diverse consortium of microorganisms
   that hydrolyze, ferment, and terminally oxidize organic compounds
   mediates anaerobic organic matter mineralization in anoxic sediments.
   Variable temperature regulation of the sequential processes, leading
   from the breakdown of complex particulate organic carbon to the
   production and subsequent consumption of labile, low-molecular weight,
   dissolved intermediates, could play a key role in controlling rates of
   overall organic carbon mineralization. We examined sediment organic
   carbon cycling in a sediment slurry and in flow through bioreactor
   experiments. The data show a variable temperature response of the
   microbial functional groups mediating organic matter mineralization in
   anoxic marine sediments, resulting in the temperature-driven decoupling
   of the production and consumption of organic intermediates. This
   temperature-cl riven decoupling leads to the accumulation of labile,
   low-molecular weight, dissolved organic carbon at low temperatures and
   low-molecular weight dissolved organic carbon limitation of terminal
   metabolism at higher temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{The biogeochemical processes were identified which improved the leachate
   composition in the flow direction of a landfill leachate plume
   (Banisveld, The Netherlands). Groundwater observation wells were placed
   at specific locations after delineating the leachate plume using
   geophysical tests to map subsurface conductivity. Redox processes were
   determined using the distribution of solid and soluble redox species,
   hydrogen concentrations, concentration of dissolved gases (N-2, Ar, and
   CH4), and stable isotopes (delta(15)N-NO3, delta(34)S-SO4,
   delta(13)C-CH4, delta(2)H-CH4, and delta(13)C of dissolved organic and
   inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively)). The combined application
   of these techniques improved the redox interpretation considerably.
   Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased downstream in association with
   increasing delta(13)C-DOC values confirming the occurrence of
   degradation. Degradation of DOC was coupled to iron reduction inside the
   plume, while denitrification could be an important redox process at the
   top fringe of the plume. stable carbon and hydrogen isotope signatures
   of methane indicated that methane was formed inside the landfill and not
   in the plume. Total gas pressure exceeded hydrostatic pressure in the
   plume, and methane seems subject to degassing. Quantitative proof for
   DOC degradation under iron-reducing conditions could only be obtained if
   the geochemical processes cation exchange and precipitation of carbonate
   minerals (siderite and calcite) were considered and incorporated in an
   inverse geochemical model of the plume. Simulation of delta(13)C-DIC
   confirmed that precipitation of carbonate minerals happened. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The interspecific variability in the sensitivity of marine bacterial
   isolates to UV-B (295- to 320-nm) radiation and their ability to recover
   from previous UV-B stress were examined, Isolates originating from
   different microenvironments of the northern Adriatic Sea were
   transferred to aged seawater and exposed to artificial UV-B radiation
   for 4 h and subsequently to different radiation regimens excluding UV-B
   to determine the recovery from UV-B stress. Bacterial activity was
   assessed by thymidine and leucine incorporation measurements prior to
   and immediately after the exposure to UV-B and after the subsequent
   exposure to the different radiation regimens. Large interspecific
   differences among the 11 bacterial isolates,were found in the
   sensitivity to UV-g, ranging from 21 to 92\% inhibition of leucine
   incorporation compared to the bacterial activity measured in dark
   controls and from 11 to 84\% for thymidine incorporation. Interspecific
   differences in the recovery from the UV stress were also large.,in
   inverse relation was detectable between the ability to recover under
   dark conditions and the recovery under photosynthetic active radiation
   (400 to 700 nm). The observed large interspecific differences in the
   sensitivity to UV-B radiation and even more so in the subsequent
   recovery from UV-B stress are not related to the prevailing radiation
   conditions of the microhabitats from which the bacterial isolates
   originate. Based on our investigations on the II marine isolates, we
   conclude that there are large interspecific differences in the
   sensitivity to UV-B radiation and even larger differences in the
   mechanisms of recovery from previous UV stress. This might lead to
   UV-mediatad shifts in the bacterioplankton community composition in
   marine surface waters.}},

Abstract = {{The photoreactivity to UV light of ultrafiltered dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) collected during cruises along salinity transects in the
   Mississippi and Atchafalaya River plumes was examined by measuring
   photogenerated free radicals and singlet molecular oxygen (O-1(2))
   photosensitization. Singlet oxygen was detected by its infrared
   phosphorescence at 1270 nm using both steady-state and time-resolved
   techniques. The O-1(2) quantum yields were corrected for self-quenching
   of O-1(2) by the DOM substrates. Photogenerated free radicals were
   monitored dy electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Two size fractions
   of the dissolved organic matter were examined: material retained with a
   3 kDa cut-off filter and material retained with a 1 kDa cut-off filter.
   The highest O-1(2) quantum yields were found in the lower molecular mass
   material. Then was little change in the O-1(2) quantum yields with
   increasing salinity, indicating that the photosensitizing ability of the
   estuarine DOM does not decrease as terrestrial DOM is transported to sea
   and mixes with marine DOM. In contrast to O-1(2) formation, the
   steady-state levels of photoproduced free radicals did not significantly
   differ between high and low molecular mass DOM, and the levels were
   substantially higher in riverine DOM than along plume salinity
   transects. This rapid transition in free radical level suggests that
   terrestrially-derived DOM experiences significant changes in this aspect
   of its photoreactivity in low (< 10 ppt) salinity waters. Published by

Abstract = {{Fluorescence at wavelengths characteristic of humic substances
   (excitation 350 nm, emission 450 nm) have been used in this study to
   approximate concentrations of fluorescent dissolved organic material
   (FDOM). In situ regulated and unregulated benthic chambers, sediment
   cores, and laboratory tank incubations were used to study early
   diagenesis of FDOM in coastal marine sediments of the Gullmar Fjord,
   western Sweden. In the regulated in situ chambers, pH and oxygen were
   kept at relatively stable levels, while in the unregulated in situ
   chambers, pH and oxygen were left to decrease as a result of biological
   activity. FDOM porewater distributions and correlation between FDOM and
   parameters indicating mineralization showed that FDOM was formed in the
   sediment and should flux across the sediment-water interface. A
   substantial flux of FDOM was also observed during winter and spring
   conditions and during anoxic conditions fall. However, no flux was
   observed during oxic conditions fall. Modeling indicated that oxygen
   penetration depth was deeper during winter than during fall, i.e., the
   oxygen penetration depth increased during fall towards winter values. We
   suggest that as FeOOH was formed when oxygen penetration depths
   increased, FDOM was sorbed to newly formed FeOOH, inhibiting FDOM flux
   over the sediment-water interface. In addition, at onset of anoxic
   conditions in the sediment surface layer in fall incubations, FDOM flux
   from sediment to overlying water increased substantially. Increases in
   anoxic FDOM fluxes were accompanied by increases in Fe and phosphate
   fluxes. We suggest that reductively dissolved FeOOH released sorbed
   FDOM. FDOM released from FeOOH by anoxic conditions was not resorbed
   when oxic conditions were resumed. This could be an effect of higher pH
   in overlying water as compared with porewater, inhibiting FeOOH sorption
   of FDOM.}},

Abstract = {{Two water samples from the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge
   with high dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations (51 and 121 mg C
   L-1) were subjected to ultraviolet (UV) light for up to 110 days. During
   the course of the irradiations, 74-88 \% of the original dissolved
   organic carbon was lost along with 95-99 \% of the absorption at 300 nm.
   Based on changes observed during light exposure, three pools of DOM were
   identified: photo-labile, photo-refractory, and photo-produced
   compounds. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were
   used to determine structural moieties characteristic to each of these
   pools. These analyses showed aromatic carbons were preferentially
   removed while carbohydrate-like and amide/peptide-like carbons were
   preserved during UV exposure. An increase in carbon normalized C-13 NMR
   signal in the 0-50 ppm region suggests that alkyl moieties were
   produced, while FTIR signal at 1,745 cm(-1) and two-dimensional H-1-C-13
   NMR results confirmed the photochemical production of acetate. Several
   properties typically used to trace terrigenous DOM in ocean margin and
   marine environments were significantly altered. Optical properties,
   including absorption spectral slopes and fluorescence indices, as well
   as carbon-normalized lignin yields shifted from terrestrial values
   towards those more typical of coastal or open ocean samples. The loss of
   terrestrial signatures during irradiation highlights the difficulty
   faced when quantifying the contribution of terrigenous DOM to aquatic
   carbon pools.}},

Abstract = {{We present the extensive characterization of Antarctic Pony Lake (PL)
   dissolved organic matter (DOM), an International Humic Substance Society
   (IHSS) fulvic acid (FA) reference standard, using electrospray
   ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry
   (ESI FT-ICR MS) and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy
   (EEMS). PLFA is the first reference standard available through IHSS
   derived solely from a microbial source. A number of factors
   differentiate PLFA from other IHSS standards, including source material,
   geographic location, sunlight exposure, freeze-thaw conditions, and
   other in situ environmental influences. ESI FT-ICR MS and EEMS were used
   to compare the PLFA microbial DOM compositional signature with the IHSS
   Suwannee River (SR) FA, a standard frequently studied for environmental
   DOM analysis. Although CcHhOoNnSs (n = 0, 1, or 2 and s = 0 or 1)
   constituents were present in both IHSS samples, PLFA contained more N
   and S molecular species, whereas SRFA was dominated by CcHhOo compounds.
   Proteinaceous character was detected with both methods, in greater
   abundance for PLFA, which we attributed to its microbial source material
   and labile, potentially more reactive nature than SRFA. Characterization
   from both analytical techniques resulted in complementary data that
   reinforce the importance of PLFA as an IHSS reference standard that
   should be utilized for other microbiological environmental DOM
   comparisons. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microalgae are considered to be a potential alternative to terrestrial
   crops for bio-energy production due to their relatively high
   productivity per unit area of land. In this work we examined the amount
   of dissolved organic matter exuded by algal cells cultured in
   photobioreactors, to examine whether a significant fraction of the
   photoassimilated biomass could potentially be lost from the harvestable
   biomass. We found that the mean maximum amount of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) released measured 6.4\% and 17.3\% of the total organic
   carbon in cultures of Chlorella vulgaris and Dunaliella tertiolecta,
   respectively. This DOM in turn supported a significant growth of
   bacterial biomass, representing a further loss of the algal assimilated
   carbon. The release of these levels of DOC indicates that a significant
   fraction of the photosynthetically fixed organic matter could be lost
   into the surrounding water, suggesting that the actual biomass yield per
   hectare for industrial purposes could be somewhat less than expected. A
   simple and inexpensive optical technique, based on chromophoric
   dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measurements, to monitor such losses in
   commercial PBRs is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We analysed bacteriochlorophyll diel changes to assess growth rates of
   aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs in the euphotic zone across the Atlantic
   Ocean. The survey performed during Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise
   16 has shown that bacteriochlorophyll in the North Atlantic Gyre cycles
   at rates of 0.91-1.08 day(-1) and in the South Atlantic at rates of
   0.72-0.89 day(-1). In contrast, in the more productive equatorial region
   and North Atlantic it cycled at rates of up to 2.13 day(-1). These
   results suggest that bacteriochlorophyll-containing bacteria in the
   euphotic zone of the oligotrophic gyres grow at rates of about one
   division per day and in the more productive regions up to three
   divisions per day. This is in striking contrast with the relatively slow
   growth rates of the total bacterial community. Thus, aerobic anoxygenic
   phototrophs appear to be a very dynamic part of the marine microbial
   community and due to their rapid growth, they are likely to be larger
   sinks for dissolved organic matter than their abundance alone would
   predict.}},

Abstract = {{Large blooms of the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton
   Bay, Australia (27 degrees 05'S, 153 degrees 08'E) have been
   re-occurring for several years. A bloom was studied in Deception Bay
   (Northern Moreton Bay) in detail over the period January-March 2000. In
   situ data loggers and field sampling characterised various environmental
   parameters before and during the L. majuscula bloom. Various
   ecophysiological experiments were conducted on L. majuscula collected in
   the field and transported to the laboratory, including short-term (2h)
   C-14 incorporation rates and long-term (7 days) pulse amplitude
   modulated (PAM) fluorometry assessments of photosynthetic capacity. The
   effects of L. majuscula on various seagrasses in the bloom region were
   also assessed with repeated biomass sampling. The bloom commenced in
   January 2000 following usual December rainfall events, water
   temperatures in excess of 24 degrees C and high light conditions. This
   bloom expanded rapidly from 0 to a maximum extent of 8 km(2) over 55
   days with an average biomass of 210 g(dw)(-1) m(-2) in late February,
   followed by a rapid decline in early April. Seagrass biomass, especially
   Syringodium isoetifolium, was found to decline in areas of dense L.
   majuscula accumulation. Dissolved and total nutrient concentrations did
   not differ significantly (P > 0.05) preceding or during the bloom.
   However, water samples from creeks discharging into the study region
   indicated elevated concentrations of total iron (2.7-80.6 mu M) and
   dissolved organic carbon (2.5-24.7 mg L-1), associated with low pH
   values (3.8-6.7). C-14 incorporation rates by L. majuscula were
   significantly (P < 0.05) elevated by additions of iron (5 mu M Fe), an
   organic chelator, ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (5 mu M EDTA) and
   phosphorus (5 mu M PO4-3). Photosynthetic capacity measured with PAM
   fluorometry was also stimulated by various nutrient additions, but not
   significantly (P > 0.05). These results suggest that the L. majuscula
   bloom may have been stimulated by bioavailable iron, perhaps complexed
   by dissolved organic carbon. The rapid bloom expansion observed may then
   have been sustained by additional inputs of nutrients (N and P) and iron
   through sediment efflux, stimulated by redox changes due to decomposing
   L. majuscula mats. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Elemental analyses (H, N, C, O, S), bulk isotope analyses (C-13, N-15)
   and C-13 content of pyrolysis products from Sphagnum moss, underlying
   peat from a bog and the bog water (Hohlohsee, Black Forest, Germany)
   were performed to identify humification processes in the early
   diagenesis of peat formation and to determine the origin of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) in the bog lake. Atomic ratios of bulk elemental
   analysis suggest a compositional shift from carbohydrate dominated
   structures to phenolic polymers. Observed variations of bulk delta(15)N
   and total nitrogen are likely due to microbial production. Combining
   isotopic and structural information using a coupled Py-GC/MS-IRMS system
   provides further information on the peat formation, e.g. biogeochemical
   processes of (1) biological degradation of source material, (2)
   selective preservation of individual compounds, and (3) formation of
   microbial biomass (e.g. trophic level effect). In particular, the stable
   isotope data helped to identify microbial processes as a source for
   carbohydrate pyrolysis products in deeper horizons. The comparison of
   pyrolysis products from peat and DOM from the bog lake indicates
   different sources. From the isotope ratios of pyrolysates it is
   suggested that DOM is formed in situ by microbial production and not
   simply dissolved from the peat profile. The uptake of C-13 depleted
   carbon, e.g. respired CO2, CO2 from the oxidation of methane or acetic
   acid is proposed as an important factor in the formation of dissolved
   organic matter. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In several recent studies, a net stimulation of bacterial growth has
   been demonstrated after exposing humic surface waters to solar radiation
   or artificial ultraviolet radiation. This stimulation has been
   attributed to a photochemical release of bioavailable carbon or nitrogen
   compounds (ammonium). In a synoptic experiment, we exposed 0.2 mu m
   filtered water from 12 different habitats in a river system, dominated
   by allochthonous carbon input, to mild artificial UV radiation. A
   significant photochemical release of carboxylic acids of low molecular
   weight occurred. Furthermore, the exposure increased carbon-limited
   bacterial yield on average by a factor of 1.7. No photochemical
   production of free ammonium could be detected, which was in accordance
   with the lack of effects of radiation on bacterial growth yield under
   nitrogen-limited conditions. We conclude that, in boreal systems
   dominated by allochthonous carbon input, photochemical production of
   bioavailable carbon rather than nitrogen compounds is likely to
   positively influence the total substrate pool available for bacterial
   utilization.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{191}},
Pages = {{1-18}},
Abstract = {{Occurrence, composition and biolability of total dissolved nitrogen
   (TDN, including dissolved inorganic and organic N ({[}DIN and DON]) were
   examined in May and July 1996 in the northern (Koiguste transect) and
   southern part (Saulkrasti transect) of the Gulf of Riga. In the
   Saulkrasti transect, the Daugava River was a major source or TDN as
   indicated by concentrations of up to 60 mu M TDN in the river plume,
   compared to about 20 mu M TDN in the open gulf. DON made up 80 to 90 \%
   of the TDN, but on May 16 a nitrate-rich river plume lowered the
   proportion of DON to 65 \%. Riverine DIN and DON stimulated the
   biological activity along the transect in May, but apparently not in
   July. In the Koiguste transect, concentrations of TDN were 0.5-fold
   lower than at Saulkrasti. In May, input of terrestrial nutrients to the
   inner part of the transect probably increased the biological production.
   In both transects, the labile DON fraction, defined as bacterial DON
   degradation over a week, was estimated at 4 to 29 \%, with an average of
   13 \%. Dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA) made up 10 to 30 \% of the
   DON. A high DON lability coincided with a large proportion of DCAA,
   relative to TDN, or a high algal biomass. The L/D ratio of especially
   dissolved combined glutamic acid appeared to be a potential indicator of
   DON lability. DCAA, as well as dissolved free amino acids (DFAA), were
   dominant nutrient sources to the bacteria, on average sustaining 77 \%
   (range 8 to 136 \%) of the bacterial N demand. In addition to amino
   acids, the bacteria incorporated or released DIN and urea. The effect of
   solar radiation on DON biolability was tested, but no consistent
   evidence for a Light effect on transformation or bacterial utilization
   of recalcitrant DON was found. Our results show that there is an active
   microbial cycling of DON in the gulf, driven in part by input of N from
   the Daugava River. In summer, availability of assimilable N appears to
   limit. the microbial activity as indicated by an estimated C/N ratio of
   43 of labile DOM, as compared to a ratio of 4 in May. The microbial N
   dynamics in the Gulf of Riga are comparable to low-eutrophic estuaries
   and do not indicate direct eutrophication effects.}},

Abstract = {{Observations are reviewed which indicate that not only phytoplankton,
   but also heterotrophic bacteria are P-limited during those seasons when
   there is stratification in the Mediterranean. It is discussed how these
   observations fit into a general concept of a site-structured food chain
   where: the structure is a result of combined top-down control from
   sits-selective predators and site-dependent competition for phosphate.
   It is argued that, conceptually, labile DOC and silicate have
   symmetrical roles in potentially controlling the Aux of P through the
   `microbial' and `classical' sides, respectively, of this food web. The
   resulting concept provides a model linking C, P, and Si fluxes to the
   size spectrum of biogenic particles in the photic zone. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Identical techniques and laboratory equipment were used to compare
   photosynthetic particulate assimilation and excretion of dissolved
   organic compounds (EOC) by different size classes of phytoplankton from
   marine and freshwater ecosystems. The subsequent assimilation and
   respiration of these algal exudates by bacteria were measured. The
   percentage of extracellular release of dissolved organic compounds was
   lower (4 to 5 \%) for larger algal cells than for picoeukaryotes (29
   \%). Bacterial assimilation of the EOC released by the algae under these
   conditions seemed to be related more to algal species than to biovolume,
   although there may also be an effect on the specific bacterial
   assemblages. Bacterial uptake and utilization of EOC was 19\% for
   freshwater picoeukaryotes, and 18 to 70 \% for marine nanoplankton.
   Great variations were found in the respiration rates of natural bacteria
   on EOC released by the freshwater picoalgae (95 \%) and nanoplanktonic
   salt pond algae (20 to 41\%).}},

Abstract = {{Three large diatoms, Stephanopyxis palmeriana (Greville) Grunow,
   Pseudoquinardia recta von Stosch, and Navicula sp. (cell volumes 1.15 x
   10(5) to 3.83 x 10(5) mum3), were isolated from the Sargasso Sea and
   cultivated in batch cultures under low irradiance. Growth rates mu of
   each species occurred in 2 phases, an exponential phase where mu varied
   from 0.72 to 1.12 d-1 and a much slower transition phase that lasted
   from 3 to 6 d. We suspect that diffusion limitation of nutrient
   transport controlled growth rates during this latter phase. Exponential
   growth rates were rapid enough to meet the requirements of a bloom
   scenario whereby total annual new production in a locale such as the
   Sargasso Sea could be met in a single 21 d bloom, The C:N:P ratio of all
   3 species was close to the Redfield proportions during exponential
   growth. Uncoupling between photosynthesis and nutrient acquisition was
   evident in 1 species, S. palmeriana, with carbon accumulation, both in
   the form of phytoplankton carbon and dissolved organic carbon,
   continuing well into the stationary phase, long after nutrients were
   depleted from the growth medium. In fact, 50\% of particulate organic
   carbon production occurred after the culture entered the stationary
   phase. Clearly there is ambiquity in the traditional definition of new
   production which implies that over a relatively short time scale a
   balance exists between new nitrogen entering the euphotic zone and new
   carbon production, assuming a Redfield stoichiometry between cellular
   carbon and nitrogen. The excess carbon, both particulate and dissolved,
   could lead to large discrepancies in estimates of new production.}},

Abstract = {{Methylmercury (MeHg) is the only species of mercury (Hg) to biomagnify
   in aquatic food-webs to levels that are a widespread concern for human
   and ecological health. Here we investigate the association between
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seawater and Hg speciation and uptake
   using experimental data and field measurements from Long Island Sound
   (LIS) and the Northwestern Atlantic continental margin. We measured
   differences in DOM composition across sampling stations using excitation
   emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy and further separated DOM into
   terrestrial and marine components using Parallel Factor Analysis
   (PARAFAC). Highest MeHg concentrations were found in the estuarine
   stations (LIS) with highest DOM concentrations due to enhanced external
   inputs from the watershed and rivers. For stations on the shelf and
   slope, MeHg in plankton increased linearly with a decreasing fraction of
   fluorescence attributable to DOM components with a terrestrial rather
   than marine origin. These results are corroborated by experimental data
   showing higher MeHg uptake by cells in the presence of predominantly
   marine DOM compared to terrestrial DOM. Highest fractions of dissolved
   gaseous mercury were also found at stations with the highest marine DOM
   content, suggesting a greater reducible fraction of divalent inorganic
   Hg. These data suggest DOM composition is a critical driver of Hg
   reactivity and bioavailability in offshore marine waters.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal lakes are biogeochemical hotspots that alter carbon fluxes by
   sequestering particulate organic carbon in sediments(1,2) and by
   oxidizing terrestrial dissolved organic matter to carbon dioxide (CO2)
   or methane through microbial processes(3,4). At present, such dilute
   lakes release similar to 1.4 petagrams of carbon annually to the
   atmosphere(3,4), and this carbon efflux may increase in the future in
   response to elevated temperatures(5) and increased hydrological delivery
   of mineralizable dissolved organic matter to lakes(6,7). Much less is
   known about the potential effects of climate changes on carbon fluxes
   from carbonate-rich hardwater and saline lakes that account for about 20
   per cent of inland water surface area(4,8). Here we show that
   atmospheric warming may reduce CO2 emissions from hardwater lakes. We
   analyse decadal records of meteorological variability, CO2 fluxes and
   water chemistry to investigate the processes affecting variations in pH
   and carbon exchange(9,10) in hydrologically diverse lakes of central
   North America. We find that the lakes have shifted progressively from
   being substantial CO2 sources in the mid-1990s to sequestering CO2 by
   2010, with a steady increase in annual mean pH. We attribute the
   observed changes in pH and CO2 uptake to an atmospheric-warming induced
   decline in ice cover in spring that decreases CO2 accumulation under
   ice, increases spring and summer pH, and enhances the chemical uptake of
   CO2 in hardwater lakes. Our study suggests that rising temperatures do
   not invariably increase CO2 emissions from aquatic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Formula assignment is one of the key challenges in evaluation of
   dissolved organic matter analyses using ultra-high resolution mass
   spectrometry (FTICR MS). The number of possible solutions for elemental
   formulas grows exponentially with increasing nominal mass, especially
   when non-oxygen heteroatoms like N, S or P are considered. Until now, no
   definitive solution for finding the correct elemental formula has been
   given. For that reason an approach from the viewpoint of chemical
   feasibility was elucidated. To illustrate the new chemical formula
   assignment principle, a literature data set was used and evaluated by
   simplified chemical constraints. Only formulas containing a maximum of
   one sulphur and five nitrogen atoms were selected for further data
   processing. The resulting data table was then divided into mass peaks
   with unique component solutions (singlets, representing unequivocal
   formula assignments) and those with two or more solutions (multiple
   formula assignments, representing equivocal formula assignments). Based
   on a {[}double bond equivalent (DBE) versus the number of oxygen atoms
   (o)] frequency contour plot and a frequency versus {[}DBE minus o]
   diagram, a new assessment and decision strategy was developed to
   differentiate multiple formula assignments into chemically reliable and
   less reliable molecular formulas. Using this approach a considerable
   number of reliable components were identified within the equivocal part
   of the data set. As a control, a considerable proportion of the assigned
   formulas deemed to be reliable correspond to those which would have been
   obtained by CH2-based Kendrick mass defect analysis. We conclude that
   formula assignment in complex mixtures can be improved by group-wise
   decisions based on the frequency and the {[}DBE minus o] values of
   multiple formula assignments.}},

Abstract = {{Polyethylene-water partitioning coefficients (K-PE) and mass transfer

   metabolites dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD),
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and,
   dichlorodiphenylmonochloroethylene (DDMU) were measured. These data were
   used to derive activated carbon (AC) sorption isotherms in clean water
   in the sub-nanogram per litre free aqueous concentration range for a
   Virgin and a regenerated AC. The sorption strength of AC for DDT and its
   metabolites was very high and logarithmic values of the AC-water
   partitioning coefficients, logK(AC), ranged from 8.47 to 9.26. A
   numerical mass transfer model was calibrated with this data to interpret
   previously reported reductions in DDT uptake by semipermeable membrane
   devices after AC amendment of sediment from Lauritzen Channel,
   California, USA. The activated carbon-water partitioning coefficient
   values (K-AC) measured in clean water systems appear to overestimate the
   AC sorption capacity in sediment up to a factor 32 for DDT and its
   metabolites at long contact time with fine-sized AC. Modelling results
   show decreased attenuation of the AC sorption capacity with increased
   sediment-AC contact time. We infer that increased resistance in mass
   transfer of DDTs to sorption sites in the microporous region likely
   caused by deposits of dissolved organic matter in the macro- and
   mesopores of AC appears to be the most relevant fouling mechanism. These
   results suggest that DDTs may diffuse through possible deposits of
   dissolved organic matter over time, implying that the effects of
   sediment on the sorption of DDTs by AC may be more kinetic than
   competitive. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter isolated from the deep Atlantic Ocean and
   fractionated into a so-called hydrophobic (HPO) fraction and a very
   hydrophilic (HPI) fraction was analyzed for the first time by Fourier
   transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) to
   resolve the molecular species, to determine their exact masses, and to
   calculate their molecular formulas. The elemental composition of about
   300 molecules was identified. Those in the HPO fraction (C-14 age of
   5100 year) are very similar to much younger freshwater fulvic acids, but
   less aromatic and more oxygenated molecules are more frequent This trend
   continues toward the HPI fraction and may indicate biotic and abiotic
   aging processes that this material experienced since its primary
   production thousands of years ago. In the HPI fraction series of
   nitrogenous molecules containing one, two, or three nitrogens were
   identified by FTICR-MS. Product ion spectra of the nitrogenous molecules
   suggest that the nitrogen atoms in these molecules are included in the
   (alicyclic) backbone of these molecules, possibly in reduced form. These
   mass spectrometric data suggest that a large set of stable fulvic acids
   is ubiquitous in all aquatic compartments. Although sources may differ,
   their actual composition and structure appears to be quite similar and
   largely independent from their source, because they are the remainder of
   intensive oxidative degradation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Mississippi plume
   region may have several distinct sources: riverine (terrestrial soils),
   wetland (terrestrial plants), biological production (phytoplankton,
   zooplankton, microbial), and sediments. Complex mixing,
   photodegradation, and biological processes make differentiation of the
   specific sources of CDOM difficult. Using a combination of high
   resolution in situ observations on an undulating vehicle, the
   ECOShuttle, a pumping system mounted on the vehicle, and detailed
   chemical and biological analyses of discrete samples allowed us to
   characterize two specific sources of CDOM in the Louisiana Bight: the
   river water constrained in the upper 12 m of the Mississippi River plume
   and several subsurface layers of CDOM below the plume. The subsurface
   CDOM maxima were coincident with steep pycnoclines and sometimes with
   maxima in chlorophyll a fluorescence. Both sources were actively
   supplying CDOM to the same location by entirely different processes. The
   subsurface CDOM was more biologically labile and photochemically
   refractory than the surface CDOM. Optical properties were also different
   with a relatively higher protein fluorescence and a lower spectral slope
   coefficient in the subsurface CDOM. The geographical extent of the two
   sources was determined by three-dimensional mapping of the area, and due
   to the relatively calm conditions in the summer of 2000, thin layers of
   CDOM produced in the subsurface were observed throughout the region.
   While riverine inputs dominated the distribution of CDOM in surface
   waters <12 m in depth, biological production of CDOM, probably due to
   the bacterial degradation of phytoplankton produced DOM dominated the
   subsurface waters. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A constituent of the bacterial cell wall, peptidoglycan, has been
   suggested to be a significant fraction of marine dissolved organic
   matter, but little is known about its turnover. We measured. hydrolysis
   and remineralization rates of peptidoglycan in surface waters by using
   radiolabeled peptidoglycan that was extracted from a Gram-negative
   bacterium. Polysaccharide (N-acetyl-glucosamine and N-acetyl-muramic
   acids) and peptide (D-glutamate) components of peptidoglycan were
   specifically radiolabeled. Purity of the preparations and specificity of
   labeling were ascertained by high-performance liquid chromatography.
   First-order kinetic constants of peptidoglycan remineralization were
   2-21 times lower than those of proteins. The turnover time of
   peptidoglycan was estimated to be 10-167 d, indicating its semilabile
   nature. The two main components of peptidoglycan are degraded
   differently; the remineralization rate of the peptide component was
   three times greater than that of the polysaccharide moiety. Chemically
   modified, low-molecular-weight material was produced during the
   degradation of the polysaccharide component, but not during degradation
   of protein. These results indicate that peptidoglycan is less degradable
   than proteins in marine environments and are consistent with
   observations that D/L-isomer ratios of amino acids increase during
   early, diagenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Whenever actively photosynthesizing cells are exposed to conditions
   where carbon fluxes exceed intakes of other essential-nutrients required
   for formation of new biomass, cell division is arrested, and the excess
   carbon is stored, excreted or directed to secondary functions. The
   extent of this uncoupling and its' implications in aquatic systems are
   discussed. We focus on three examples: the cellular level of free living
   phytoplankton, the ecosystem level in the microbial food web, and the
   highly specialized level of species interactions in the symbiotic
   association between zooxanthellae and corals. These examples highlight
   the adaptive significance of uncoupling between photosynthesis and
   growth in aquatic systems. Moreover, we underscore the fact that in many
   real-world situations, net primary productivity cannot be equated to
   population growth.
   Roles of the ``excess{''} carbon include photoprotective pigments and
   buoyancy regulating ballast. The excreted carbon compounds may protect
   cells or cell masses from desiccation, and fuel the microbial loop. The
   microbial loop increases overall nutrient extraction efficiency compared
   to that of which phytoplankton alone are capable.
   The zooxanthellae-coelenterate symbiosis drives the nutrient and energy
   fluxes supporting coral reef life in the nutrient-poor tropical seas. In
   those mutualistic associations, since photosynthesis is normally
   uncoupled from cell growth, the algae excrete most of their
   photosynthate and that supports the metabolic activities of the host.}},

Abstract = {{Several aspects of bacterial glucose assimilation and bacterial
   production (EP) were investigated over 2 d in the upper 300 m of the
   Gulf of Mexico. Glucose concentrations ranged from 2 to 15 nM in surface
   seawater; glucose utilization rates were 1-3 nM d(-1) in the upper 150 m
   of the water column and 0.02-0.8 nM d(-1) in deeper water (150-300 m).
   Turnover of glucose and bacteria were similar and were in the range of
   0.01-0.4 d(-1). Measured glucose assimilation rates imply that glucose
   supports similar to 5-10\% of the observed BP in surface waters. The
   limiting factors for bacterial glucose utilization varied with depth.
   Glucose assimilation seemed to be Limited by availability of inorganic N
   in the chlorophyll maximum. Additions of nitrate or ammonium had similar
   effects on glucose assimilation. BP was limited by C below and above the
   chlorophyll maximum. Additions of high-molecular-weight (HMW) dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) decreased bacterial glucose uptake rates,
   indicating that substances competing with glucose assimilation were
   derived from HMW DOM extracellularly. Thus, the measurement of free
   glucose assimilation appears to integrate bacterial utilization of
   combined glucose and indicates that many of the free sugars in seawater
   may be derived from polymers. The higher glucose assimilation rates
   achieved with inorganic nutrient additions indicate that bacterial
   degradation of C-rich organic matter (OM) could vary between ocean
   regions with varying inorganic nutrient concentrations.}},

   responded rapidly to shifts from dark to light and vice versa,

Abstract = {{Glacial meltwater exports a unique type of organic carbon to marine
   systems, distinct from non-glacially derived riverine export,
   potentially capable of stimulating downstream marine primary
   productivity. Here, we describe for the first time the bulk-level
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC)
   isotopic composition of glacial meltwater draining the Greenland ice
   sheet (GrIS). These data, in conjunction with an earlier study that
   investigated the molecular-level composition of GrIS dissolved organic
   matter, collectively describe the concentration, radiocarbon content,
   and lability of organic carbon in subglacial discharge from a
   land-terminating outlet glacier during a melt season. By scaling up our
   measurements across the ice sheet, we estimate that the annual DOC flux
   from the GrIS (0.08 Tg/y) is equivalent to that from a small Arctic
   river (discharge (Q) < 50 km(3)/y), and that the annual POC flux from
   the GrIS (0.9 Tg/y) may be comparable to that of a large Arctic river (Q
   > 200 km(3)/y). The DOC flux is derived primarily from beneath the
   glacier (subglacial) (>75\%) in the early season, and from surface
   ice-melt (up to 100\%) transmitting through the subglacial environment
   at the peak of the meltseason. The POC flux is primarily derived from
   the subglacial environment throughout the meltseason. The early season
   (low flow) glacier discharge contains higher DOC concentrations (0.5-4.1
   mg L-1), and exports more enriched carbon (Delta C-14-(DOC) similar to
   -250 parts per thousand) compared to the peak season (high flow)
   discharge, when the concentrations are lower (0.1-0.6 mg L-1) and the
   Delta C-14 is more depleted (Delta C-14(DOC) similar to -400 parts per
   thousand). Conversely, the POC export (1.4-13.2 mg L-1, Delta C-14(POC)
   similar to -250 parts per thousand) shows no temporal variation in
   either concentration or radiocarbon content throughout the meltseason.
   Dissolved ion loads in concomitant samples reflected the seasonal
   evolution of the subglacial drainage system, confirming the influence of
   subglacial hydrology on the composition of the bulk carbon pools. Based
   on this work, we conclude that (1) different mechanisms control the DOC
   and POC flux from glacial systems; (2) chemically-distinct DOC pools are
   accessed by seasonally-evolving hydrological flow-paths; and (3) the
   GrIS can deliver labile carbon, which may also be 14 C-depleted, to
   downstream proglacial and marine environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Activated carbon (AC) amendment is an innovative method for the in situ
   remediation of contaminated soils. A field-scale AC amendment of either
   2\% powder or granular AC (PAC and GAC) to a PAH contaminated soil was
   carried out in Norway. The PAH concentration in drainage water from the
   field plot was measured with a direct solvent extraction and by
   deploying polyoxymethylene (POM) passive samplers. In addition, POM
   samplers were dug directly in the AC amended and unamended soil in order
   to monitor the reduction in free aqueous PAH concentrations in the soil
   pore water. The total PAH concentration in the drainage water, measured
   by direct solvent extraction of the water, was reduced by 14\% for the
   PAC amendment and by 59\% for GAC, 12 months after amendment.
   Measurements carried out with POM showed a reduction of 93\% for PAC and
   56\% for GAC. The free aqueous PAH concentration in soil pore water was
   reduced 93\% and 76\%, 17 and 28 months after PAC amendment, compared to
   84\% and 69\% for GAC. PAC, in contrast to GAC, was more effective for
   reducing freely dissolved concentrations than total dissolved ones. This
   could tentatively be explained by leaching of microscopic AC particles
   from PAC. Secondary chemical effects of the AC amendment were monitored
   by considering concentration changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   and nutrients. DOC was bound by AC, while the concentrations of
   nutrients (NO3, NO2, NH4, PO4, P-total, K. Ca and Mg) were variable and
   likely affected by external environmental factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In advanced wastewater treatment plants that achieve high levels of
   nitrogen (N) removal, up to one-third of the N in effluent is organic,
   herein referred to as effluent organic N (EON). While we know that
   inorganic N is highly labile, it is unclear what fraction of EON is
   bioavailable. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of a method that
   can be used to examine the reactivity of EON in natural receiving waters
   to better understand both the ecosystem response and the potential
   bioavailability of EON. The technique is suitable for analyzing polar
   organic matter in natural waters; electrospray ionization coupled with
   Fourier transform mass spectrometry. Bioassays were performed on samples
   collected at the end of the biological process from two wastewater
   treatment plants achieving advanced N removal. The samples were
   concentrated, and then added to natural water samples collected from the
   oligohaline James River, a major tributary of the Chesapeake Bay. Our
   results demonstrate that while the lignin-like fraction of the effluent
   dissolved organic matter (some of which contains N) was conserved, a
   large portion of aliphatic and aromatic compounds containing N was
   removed (79-100\%) during incubations, while other compounds were
   produced. Furthermore, the two effluents exhibited differences in the
   degree of degradation and type of degradation, which can be related both
   to the various processes employed in the two WWTPs and the dramatic
   differences in the type of influent they received. These findings
   suggest that EON is highly reactive in the natural environment and that
   simple assays examining net consumption or production of bulk dissolved
   organic N pools are inadequate for assessing the bioavailability of EON.

Abstract = {{The mid-Ediacaran Mistaken Point biota of Newfoundland represents the
   first morphologically complex organisms in the fossil record. At the
   classic Mistaken Point localities the biota is dominated by the
   enigmatic group of ``fractally{''} branching organisms called
   rangeomorphs. One of the few exceptions to the rangeomorph body plan is
   the fossil Thectardis avalonensis, which has been reconstructed as an
   upright, open cone with its apex in the sediment. No biological affinity
   has been suggested for this fossil, but here we show that its body plan
   is consistent with the hydrodynamics of the sponge water-canal system.
   Further, given the habitat of Thectardis beneath the photic zone, and
   the apparent absence of an archenteron, movement, or a fractally
   designed body plan, we suggest that it is a sponge. The recognition of
   sponges in the Mistaken Point biota provides some of the earliest body
   fossil evidence for this group, which must have ranged through the
   Ediacaran based on biomarkers, molecular clocks, and their position on
   the metazoan tree of life, in spite of their sparse macroscopic fossil
   record. Should our interpretation be correct, it would imply that the
   paleoecology of the Mistaken Point biota was dominated by sponges and
   rangeomorphs, organisms that are either known or hypothesized to feed in
   large part on dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The biology of these two
   clades gives insight into the structure of the Ediacaran ocean, and
   indicates that a non-uniformitarian mechanism delivered labile DOC to
   the Mistaken Point seafloor.}},

Abstract = {{We now have a relatively good idea of how bulk microbial processes shape
   the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in the sea. The advent of
   the molecular biology era in microbial ecology has resulted in advanced
   knowledge about the diversity of marine microorganisms, suggesting that
   we might have reached a high level of understanding of carbon fluxes in
   the oceans. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that there are
   large gaps in the understanding of the role of bacteria in regulating
   carbon fluxes. These gaps may result from methodological as well as
   conceptual limitations. For example, should bacterial production be
   measured in the light? Can bacterial production conversion factors be
   predicted, and how are they affected by loss of tracers through
   respiration? Is it true that respiration is relatively constant compared
   to production? How can accurate measures of bacterial growth efficiency
   be obtained? In this paper, we discuss whether such questions could (or
   should) be addressed. Ongoing genome analyses are rapidly widening our
   understanding of possible metabolic pathways and cellular adaptations
   used by marine bacteria in their quest for resources and struggle for
   survival (e.g. utilization of light, acquisition of nutrients, predator
   avoidance, etc.). Further, analyses of the identity of bacteria using
   molecular markers (e.g. subgroups of Bacteria and Archaea) combined with
   activity tracers might bring knowledge to a higher level. Since
   bacterial growth (and thereby consumption of DOC and inorganic
   nutrients) is likely regulated differently in different bacteria, it
   will be critical to learn about the life strategies of the key bacterial
   species to achieve a comprehensive understanding of bacterial regulation
   of C fluxes. Finally, some processes known to occur in the microbial
   food web are hardly ever characterized and are not represented in
   current food web models. We discuss these issues and offer specific
   comments and advice for future research agendas.}},

   with other simple carbon compounds). We found that GGE was unaffected by
   growth rate, the C:N-S ratio, or different combinations of carbon and
   nitrogen substrates, averaging similar to 50\%. However the 95\%
   confidence interval was as high as +/-20\%, suggesting that experimental
   error may be a common problem in determining GGE in laboratory studies
   and a far more serious problem in making such estimates in field
   studies. The C:N-B ratio was invariant at similar to 4.5:1 (by atoms)
   under all conditions when carbon was limiting growth, but increased to
   similar to 7 : 1-9. 1 when reaching the stationary phase during batch
   growth and up to 13 :1 at very low growth rates in continuous culture.
   These results indicate that the C:N-B ratio has some value as a
   diagnostic tool for determining the physiological state of bacterial
   populations, although there are some concerns about its general
   applicability. Finally, there was absolutely no evidence that NH4+
   uptake was inhibited in the presence of amino acids. The key to NH4+
   uptake is the presence of a readily assimilated carbon source to balance
   nitrogen uptake stoichiometrically. These findings have some bearing on
   the recent suggestions that gradients exist in both GGE and nitrogen
   preference of marine bacteria from productive inshore regions to the
   oligotrophic open ocean.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the seasonal dynamics and consumption by planktonic bacteria
   of the labile pools of dissolved organic carbon (DOClab), dissolved
   amino acids (TDAA(lab)), and dissolved carbohydrates (TDCHOlab) in Lake
   Constance, Germany, between March and October 1994. The labile pools
   were defined as those fractions consumed by bacteria in 1 mu m filtered
   samples over 4 d. DOClab varied from 0.064 to 0.606 mg C l(-1) and
   constituted 5 to 36 \% of bulk DOC, which ranged between 1.45 and 2.3 mg
   C l(-1). Proportion of DOClab >13 \% occurred during the phytoplankton
   spring bloom, whereas later in the year <13 \% of bulk DOC was labile.
   The bacterial growth efficiency, i.e, the ratio of biomass produced over
   DOC consumed, ranged from 8 to 57 \% with a mean of 23 \% and no obvious
   seasonal trend. TDAA(lab) constituted 10 to 73 \% of bulk TDAA and 5 to
   95 \% of DOClab, respectively, with highest proportions during the
   spring bloom, the clear-water phase (not of DOClab), and a phytoplankton
   bloom in July. TDCHOlab constituted 24 to 73 \% of bulk TDCHO and 5 to
   86 \% of DOClab, respectively, with highest proportions during the
   clear-water phase and in September. TDAA(lab) and TDCHOlab were
   positively correlated to bulk TDAA and bulk TDCHO, respectively. Even
   though both substrate classes were the major components of the labile
   DOC and together constituted 47 to 100 \% of DOClab in 75 \% of the
   experiments, they were not utilized to equal amounts but relative
   proportions varied considerably from May to September. Both substrates
   often were also utilized differently for biosynthetic and energy
   requirements as demonstrated by respiration measurements of C-14-amino
   acids and C-14-glucose. During the spring bloom amino acids were
   respired preferentially, whereas during the summer bloom glucose was
   respired preferentially. Turnover times of amino acids and glucose also
   demonstrated that both substrate classes were utilized differently
   because turnover times of glucose were consistently longer than those of
   amino acids except in surface waters from mid-July until September.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the seasonal variation of biotic and abiotic processes and
   the physico-chemical forcing factors involved in the production and
   consumption of dimethylsulfide (DMS) and its precursor
   dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) at a coastal sampling station in the
   northwestern Mediterranean. Monthly samplings of surface seawater for an
   18-month period revealed that algal-associated DMSP and
   dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) did not follow total phytoplankton biomass
   (measured as chlorophyll a {[}Chl a]). DMSP concentrations peaked 1 or 2
   months later than the late winter Chl a bloom, following phytoplankton
   succession, whereas particulate DMSO was maximal in summer. Both Chl a
   -normalized concentrations (DMSP : Chl a and DMSO: Chl a) exhibited a
   clear seasonality with maxima in summer, which was indicative of
   concurrent phytoplankton succession and physiological acclimation toward
   higher dimethylated sulfur-producing taxa in summer. DMS concentrations
   also showed clear maxima in mid-summer and minima in winter, which is
   anticorrelated with Chl a. Gross DMS production rates were higher in
   summer, coinciding with higher DMSP-to-DMS conversion yields and
   exceeded microbial DMS consumption in this season. Heterotrophic
   bacteria and DMSP-assimilating phytoplankton only accounted for a
   portion (annual average 52\%) of total DMSP transformations, suggesting
   that phytoplankton DMSP-lyases, either in stressed cells or upon grazing
   by herbivores, must play a more important role in DMS production than is
   generally believed. Calculated photolysis and measured microbial
   consumption alternated in dominance as DMS sinks over the year, with
   ventilation to the atmosphere generally being a minor loss process.
   Under higher solar radiation (from March to September), calculated
   photolysis followed variations of colored dissolved organic matter, a
   known DMS photosensitizer.}},

Abstract = {{Total hydrolyzable amino acid and fluorescence properties, using
   3-dimensional excitation and emission matrix (3DEEM) spectroscopy of the
   bulk and four molecular mass fractions (GF/F-0.1 mum, 0.1 mum-10 kDa, 10
   kDa-5 kDa and < 5 kDa) of dissolved organic matter (DOM), were
   determined in the surface (10 m) and deep (1000 m) waters of Sagami Bay,
   Japan. Among the molecular mass fractions, we found a successive
   decrease in degradation index (DI) derived from amino acid composition
   with decreasing molecular mass in both surface and deep waters,
   indicating that relatively fresh and large molecules become smaller in
   size along a degradation pathway. In the 3DEEM fluorescence patterns of
   high molecular mass DOM, only a tryptophan-like fluorophore was observed
   in the surface water. In contrast, both tryptophan- and tyrosine-like
   fluorophores were observed in the deep water, indicating that amino
   acid-containing DOM in the high molecular mass fractions was comprised
   of protein molecules or least degraded proteins (polypeptides) in
   surface water, but in deep water other forms of amino acids were
   dominant even though the molecular mass fractions were of the same size.
   We hypothesize that degradation products (peptides) form high molecular

Abstract = {{A knowledge of the balance between plankton gross primary production
   (GPP) and community respiration (CR) in the open ocean is vital to the
   accurate determination of the global carbon cycle, yet the paucity of
   open ocean measurements severely limits our understanding. This study
   measured GPP, net community production, dark CR, and size-fractionated
   primary production in the upper 200 m of a 12,100 km latitudinal (32
   degreesS-48 degreesN) transect in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean during May
   and June 1998. This comprehensive data set, which spans five contrasting
   plankton regimes, including two open ocean oligotrophic provinces, is
   used to derive a GPP: CR relationship, which suggests that net
   heterotrophy (GPP < CR) prevails in the eastern Atlantic when primary
   production falls below <similar to>100 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1). The
   predictive capability of this relationship is compared with that of the
   only other published relationship based on similar methodologies and is
   found to give a more representative description of the autotrophic (GPP
   > CR) to heterotrophic seasonal cycle in the Bay of Biscay. This
   improved predictive power is attributed to the increased
   representativeness of the current data set. Specifically, the
   interpretation suggests that the influence of community structure on net
   ecosystem metabolism implies that prediction of GPP:CR balances in
   pelagic ecosystems can be best achieved by use of a data set that covers
   a wide range of community structure and not only a wide range in the
   magnitude of primary production.}},

Abstract = {{Natural organic matter is an important pool that is not yet totally
   described. Two types of compounds are found: some chemically well
   characterised molecules (biopolymers) and uncharacterised humic
   substances (geopolymers). The spectroscopic properties of this pool of
   organic matter have recently been advanced by the excitation emission
   fluorescence matrix (EEFM) {[}Coble, G. P. (1996) Characterization of
   marine and terrestrial DOM in seawater using excitation-emission matrix
   spectroscopy. Marine Chemistry 51, 325-346.]. Three types of
   fluorophores are described by their excitation/emission wavelength at
   maximum intensity (lambda(ex)/lambda(em))(max): the tyrosin and
   tryptophan like structures, not examined here, and the humic like
   fluorescent structures of type A (lambda(260)/lambda(445)) and type C
   (lambda(330)/lambda(445)) The EEFM applied to sequential tangential
   ultrafiltered (UFTS) amazonian fresh waters give spectroscopic
   information on the fluorescent properties of particulate (>0.22 mu m),
   colloidal and dissolved (< 5 kDa) organic matter. Chromophores A and C
   are present in all sized fraction samples. Their
   (lambda(ex)/lambda(em))(max) are in the same domains as those of
   terrestrial humic substances {[}Seritti, A., Morelli, E., Nannicini. L.
   and Del Vecchio. R. (1994) Production of hydrophobic fluorescent organic
   matter by marine diation Pheodactylum tricornutum. Chemosphere 28(1),
   117-129; Coble, G. P. (1996) Characterization of marine and terrestrial
   DOM in seawater using excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy, Marine
   Chemistry 51, 325-346.]. Differentiation of the type A and type C peaks
   in 3D diagrams are based on their (lambda(ex)/lambda(em))(max) position
   and the I-a/I-c ratio. Differences are observed between humic material
   extracted by hydrophobic resins or concentrated sample from tangential
   sequential ultrafiltration (UFTS). Spectroscopic properties of the humic
   material are not modified by the ultrafiltration process. A particular
   attention is given on the differentiation between black water (Rio Negro
   River) and white water (Rio Solimoes and Rio Madeira River). Black
   waters are generally known as humic rich and low mineral content waters.
   EEFM analysis on these two types of water lead to the following
   conclusions: (i) the humic like fluorescent compounds of type C are
   preferentially retained by membranes with 5 kDa cut off. These compounds
   have the larger molecular weight. (ii) In the presence of copper cation,
   the type C compounds are divided in two groups according to their
   (lambda(ex)/lambda(em))(max): the First one is invariant, the other one
   expands (20 nm) its efficient excitation wavelength domain. (iii)
   Photochemical reactions induced by UV irradiation also lead to a 20 nm
   expansion of the efficient excitation wavelength domain. From these
   spectroscopic and molecular weight complementary data, it is proposed
   that A type fluorophores are close to fulvic acids while C fluorophores
   seems to be more related to humic acid. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Subglacial sediments sampled from beneath Robertson Glacier (RG),
   Alberta, Canada, were shown to harbor diverse assemblages of potential
   nitrifiers, nitrate reducers, and diazotrophs, as assessed by amoA,
   narG, and nifH gene biomarker diversity. Although archaeal amoA genes
   were detected, they were less abundant and less diverse than bacterial
   amoA, suggesting that bacteria are the predominant nitrifiers in RG
   sediments. Maximum nitrification and nitrate reduction rates in
   microcosms incubated at 4 degrees C were 280 and 18.5 nmol of N per g of
   dry weight sediment per day, respectively, indicating the potential for
   these processes to occur in situ. Geochemical analyses of subglacial
   sediment pore waters and bulk subglacial meltwaters revealed low
   concentrations of inorganic and organic nitrogen compounds. These data,
   when coupled with a C/N atomic ratio of dissolved organic matter in
   subglacial pore waters of similar to 210, indicate that the sediment
   communities are N limited. This may reflect the combined biological
   activities of organic N mineralization, nitrification, and nitrate
   reduction. Despite evidence of N limitation and the detection of nifH,
   we were unable to detect biological nitrogen fixation activity in
   subglacial sediments. Collectively, the results presented here suggest a
   role for nitrification and nitrate reduction in sustaining microbial
   life in subglacial environments. Considering that ice currently covers
   11\% of the terrestrial landmass and has covered significantly greater
   portions of Earth at times in the past, the demonstration of
   nitrification and nitrate reduction in subglacial environments furthers
   our understanding of the potential for these environments to contribute
   to global biogeochemical cycles on glacial-interglacial timescales.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated along a gradient across
   the Subtropical Convergence (STC) off the South Island, New Zealand.
   Ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), excitation emission
   matrix fluorescence (EEM) spectroscopy, and molecular lignin analysis
   techniques were used to study this DOM. The analysis revealed a group of
   compounds found only in the coastal DOM samples, which were also
   characterized by an elevated terrestrial DOM fluorescence pattern and
   elevated lignin content if compared to the offshore samples. This group
   exhibited a high degree of carbon unsaturation, as evident from high
   double bond equivalence minus oxygen values (DBE-O>9) and maximum
   fluorescence intensity. Sulfur-containing molecular formulae for summer
   DOM samples were much more abundant across the entire transect of the
   STC compared to winter and exhibited distinctly different
   hydrogen:carbon and oxygen:carbon elemental ratios, suggesting a
   possible correlation between biological activity and sulfur compounds.
   The molecular formulae common to all STC samples were compared with
   those calculated for DOM extracted from freshwater collected from a
   stream discharging into Doubtful Sound (West Coast, New Zealand).
   ESI-FT-ICR-MS measurements undertaken in negative electrospray
   ionization (ESI-) mode indicated that 30\% of the molecular formulae
   were present in both types of DOM, while in positive ESI mode (ESI+)
   over 90\% of the formulae were present in all samples. Hence, a
   significant portion of the molecular formulae assigned to the
   solid-phase extractable DOM pool (SPE-DOM) appear to be identical in
   oceanic and freshwater samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in fogwater samples collected in
   southeastern Louisiana and central-eastern China has been characterized
   using excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy. The goal of
   the study was to illustrate the utility of fluorescence for obtaining
   information on the large fraction of organic carbon in fogwaters
   (typically >40\% by weight) that defies characterization in terms of
   specific chemical compounds without the difficulty inherent in obtaining
   sufficient fogwater volume to isolate DOM for assessment using other
   spectroscopic and chemical analyses. Based on the findings of previous
   studies using other characterization methods, it was anticipated that
   the unidentified organic carbon fraction would have characteristic peaks
   associated with humic substances and fluorescent amino acids. Both
   humic- and protein-like fluorophores were observed in the fogwater
   spectra and fluorescence-derived indices for the fogwater had similar
   values to those of soil and sediment porewater. Greater biological
   character was observed in samples with higher organic carbon
   concentrations. Fogwaters are shown to contain a mixture of
   terrestrially- and microbially-derived fluorescent organic material,
   which is expected to be derived from an array of different sources, such
   as suspended soil and dust particles, biogenic emissions and organic
   substances generated by atmospheric processes. The fluorescence results
   indicate that much of the unidentified organic carbon present in
   fogwater can be represented by humic-like and biologically-derived
   substances similar to those present in other aquatic systems, though it
   should be noted that fluorescent signatures representative of DOM
   produced by atmospheric processing of organic aerosols may be
   contributing to or masked by humic-like fluorophores. Published by

Title = {{Regionalisation of chemical variability in European mountain lakes}},

Abstract = {{P>1. We carried out a coordinated survey of mountain lakes covering the
   main ranges across Europe (including Greenland), sampling 379 lakes
   above the local tree line in 2000. The objectives were to identify the
   main sources of chemical variability in mountain lakes, define a
   chemical classification of lakes, and develop tools to extrapolate our
   results to regional lake populations through an empirical
   regionalisation or upscaling of chemical properties.
   2. We investigated the main causes of chemical variability using factor
   analysis (FA) and empirical relationships between chemistry and several
   environmental variables. Weathering, sea salt inputs, atmospheric
   deposition of N and S, and biological activity in soils of the catchment
   were identified as the major drivers of lake chemistry.
   3. We tested discriminant analysis (DA) to predict the lake chemistry.
   It was possible to use the lithology of the catchments to predict the
   range of Ca2+ and SO(4)2- into which a lake of unknown chemistry will
   decrease. Lakes with lower SO(4)2- concentrations have little
   geologically derived S, and better reflect the variations in atmospheric
   S loading. The influence of marine aerosols on lakewater chemistry could
   also be predicted from the minimum distance to the sea and altitude of
   the lakes.
   4. The most remarkable result of FA was to reveal a factor correlated to
   DOC (positively) and NO(3)- (negatively). This inverse relationship
   might be the result either of independent processes active in the
   catchment soils and acting in an opposite sense, or a direct
   interaction, e.g. limitation of denitrification by DOC availability.
   Such a relationship has been reported in the recent literature in many
   sites and at all scales, appearing to be a global pattern that could
   reflect the link between the C and N cycles.
   5. The concentration of NO(3)- is determined by both atmospheric N
   deposition and the processing capacity of the catchments (i.e. N uptake
   by plants and soil microbes). The fraction of the variability in NO(3)-
   because of atmospheric deposition is captured by an independent factor
   in the FA. This is the only factor showing a clear pattern when mapped
   over Europe, indicating lower N deposition in the northernmost areas.
   6. A classification has been derived which takes into account all the
   major chemical features of the mountain lakes in Europe. FA provided the
   criteria to establish the most important factors influencing lake water
   chemistry, define classes within them, and classify the surveyed lakes
   into each class. DA can be used as a tool to scale up the classification
   to unsurveyed lakes, regarding sensitivity to acidification, marine
   influence and sources of S.}},

Abstract = {{One indicator of health in estuarine and coastal ecosystems is the
   ability of local waters to transmit sunlight to planktonic, macrophytic,
   and other submerged vegetation for photosynthesis. The concentration of
   coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a primary factor affecting
   the absorption of incident sunlight in coastal and estuarine waters. In
   estuaries, CDOM concentrations vary due to changes in salinity
   gradients, inflows of industrial and domestic effluents, and the
   production of new dissolved organic matter from marine biologic
   activity. CDOM absorption data have been collected from a variety of
   waters. However, there are a limited number of measurements along the US
   east coast and a general lack of data from New England waters.
   This study characterized the temporal and spatial variability of CDOM
   absorption over an annual cycle in Narragansett Bay and Block Island
   Sound (Rhode Island). Results suggested that, in Narragansett Bay, the
   magnitude of CDOM absorption is related to the seasonal variability of
   freshwater input from surrounding watersheds and new CDOM production
   from in situ biologic activity. The data show that the average CDOM
   absorption coefficient at 412 nm was 0.45 m(-1) and the average spectral
   slope was 0.020 nm(-1). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Acetate oxidation frequently has been used as proxy of organic carbon
   decomposition in marine anoxic sediments. However, the importance of
   acetate uptake in carbon cycling in marine anoxic water columns is less
   well studied. Acetate concentrations and uptake rate constants, together
   with total bacterial numbers, primary and chemoautotrophic production
   rates, and particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes, were measured in the
   water column of the Cariaco Basin during upwelling and nonupwelling
   seasons between November 1995 and May 1999 as part of the international
   CARIACO (Carbon Retention In A Colored Ocean) program. Acetate uptake
   was found to vary strongly with depth and season. Zones of elevated
   acetate uptake were found in the surface waters and near the
   suboxic/anoxic interface. High acetate uptake in the surface oxic layer
   suggests that acetate cycling may be an important component of organic
   carbon oxidation in oxic environments as well as under anoxic
   conditions. Depth-integrated acetate uptake rates were correlated with
   the rates of organic carbon supply in the two zones (r(2) = 0.37, P =
   0.017). Comparisons of acetate oxidation rates with rates of primary
   production, chemoautotrophic production, and POC flux show that, on
   average, acetate oxidation can account for respiration of between 16 and
   46\% of the organic carbon fixed in the water column.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the roles of marine viruses in marine microbial food webs,
   it is important to determine rates and mechanisms of virus degradation
   and subsequent uptake of degraded virus material and other cell lysis
   products by heterotrophic marine bacteria. We radiolabeled and
   concentrated viruses and viral lysis products from either pure cultures
   ((3)H) Or natural communities ((3)H and (33)P) and added them to
   seawater samples of differing trophic status from coastal (mesotrophic)
   and offshore (oligotrophic) California waters and French Mediterranean
   waters (oligotrophic). Rates of degradation were determined by the loss
   of high molecular weight radiolabel over time and the fate of the
   degraded material (microbial uptake or accumulation in low molecular
   weight pools) was followed by size fractionation and/or acid extraction.
   Preliminary experiments with (3)H-labeled, single-stranded RNA phage MS2
   and marine phage H11/1 demonstrated that MS2 degraded significantly
   faster in coastal Santa Monica Bay seawater (2.5 +/- 0.6\% h(-1)), than
   the marine phage, H11/1 (0.99 +/- 0.1\% h(-1)). For labeled virus
   material from natural populations, rates of degradation were slower in
   oligotrophic waters (ranges from 1.0 to 3.3\% h(-1)) than in mesotrophic
   waters (ranges from 4.9 to 6.0\% h(-1)), corresponding to turnover rates
   of 1 to 4 d for this material. Degradation rates of labeled virus
   material are likely underestimates, because during preparation,
   degradation and uptake are continually occurring, resulting in
   accumulation of the less reactive products. The proportion of
   radiolabeled material taken up by microbes was greatest in oligotrophic
   waters, especially in the phosphate-limited Villefranche Bay, France,
   where most of the (33)PO(4)-labeled material was taken up in less than 7
   h. In contrast, the majority of degraded 3H-labeled material was not
   accumulated into biomass, and in 3 of 4 samples, accumulation was hardly
   detectable. The results suggest that viruses and lysis products are
   labile and turn over relatively rapidly, but often may not be
   efficiently incorporated into bacterial biomass.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},

Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Trillions of plastic fragments are afloat at sea, yet they represent
   only 1-2\% of the plastics entering the ocean annually. The fate of the
   missing plastic and its impact on marine life remains largely unknown.
   To address these unknowns, we irradiated post-consumer microplastics
   (polyethylene, PE; polypropylene, PP; and expanded polystyrene, EPS),
   standard PE, and plastic-fragments collected from the surface waters of
   the North Pacific Gyre under a solar simulator. We report that simulated
   sunlight can remove plastics from the sea surface. Simulated sunlight
   also fragmented, oxidized, and altered the color of the irradiated
   polymers. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is identified as a major
   byproduct of sunlight-driven plastic photodegradation. Rates of removal
   depended upon polymer chemistry with EPS degrading more rapidly than PP,
   and PE being the most photo-resistant polymer studied. The DOC released
   as most plastics photodegraded was readily utilized by marine bacteria.
   However, one sample of PE microplastics released organics or
   co-leachates that inhibited microbial growth. Thus, although sunlight
   may remove plastics from the ocean's surface, leachates formed during
   plastic photo-degradation may have mixed impacts on ocean microbes and
   the food webs they support.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is causing extensive warming across Arctic regions
   resulting in permafrost degradation, alterations to regional hydrology
   and shifting amounts and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   transported by streams and rivers. Here, we characterize the DOM
   composition and optical properties of the six largest Arctic rivers
   draining into the Arctic Ocean to examine the ability of optical
   measurements to provide meaningful insights into terrigenous carbon
   export patterns and biogeochemical cycling. The chemical composition of
   aquatic DOM varied with season, spring months were typified by highest
   lignin phenol and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with
   greater hydrophobic acid content, and lower proportions of hydrophilic
   compounds, relative to summer and winter months. Chromophoric DOM (CDOM)
   spectral slope (S275-295) tracked seasonal shifts in DOM composition
   across river basins. Fluorescence and parallel factor analysis
   identified seven components across the six Arctic rivers. The ratios of
   terrestrial humic-like vs. marine humic-like fluorescent components
   co-varied with lignin monomer ratios over summer and winter months,
   suggesting fluorescence may provide information on the age and
   degradation state of riverine DOM. CDOM absorbance (a350) proved a
   sensitive proxy for lignin phenol concentrations across all six river
   basins and over the hydrograph, enabling for the first time the
   development of a single pan-arctic relationship between a350 and
   terrigenous DOC (R2 = 0.93). Combining this lignin proxy with
   high-resolution monitoring of a350, pan-arctic estimates of annual
   lignin flux were calculated to range from 156 to 185 Gg, resulting in
   shorter and more constrained estimates of terrigenous DOM residence
   times in the Arctic Ocean (spanning 7 months to 2 years). Furthermore,
   multiple linear regression models incorporating both absorbance and
   fluorescence variables proved capable of explaining much of the
   variability in lignin composition across rivers and seasons. Our
   findings suggest that synoptic, high-resolution optical measurements can
   provide improved understanding of northern high-latitude organic matter
   cycling and flux, and prove an important technique for capturing future
   climate-driven changes.}},

Abstract = {{There are few available in situ remediation options for Hg contaminated
   sediments, short of capping. Here we present the first tests of
   activated carbon and other sorbents as potential in situ amendments for
   remediation of mercury and methylmercury (MeHg), using a study design
   that combined 2 L sediment/water microcosms with 14 day bioaccumulation
   assays. Our key key end points were pore water concentrations, and
   bioaccumulation of total Hg and MeHg by a deposit-feeding oligo-chaete
   Lumbriculus variegatus. Four amendments were tested: an activated carbon
   (AG); CETCO Organoclay MRM (MRM); Thiol-SAMMS (TS), a
   thiol-functionalized mesoporous silica; and A/VIBERSEP GT74, an
   ion-exchange resin. Amendments were tested in four separate microcosm
   assays using Hg-contaminated sediments from two freshwater and two
   estuarine sites. AC and TS amendments, added at 2-7\% of the dry weight
   of sediments significantly reduced both MeHg concentrations in pore
   waters, relative to unamended controls (by 45-95\%) and bioaccumulation
   of MeHg by Lumbriculus (by between 30 and 90\%). Both amendments had
   only small impacts on microcosm surface water, sediment and pore water
   chemistry, with the exception of significant reductions in pore water
   dissolved organic matter. The effectiveness of amendments in reducing
   bioaccumulation was well-correlated with their effectiveness in
   increasing sediment:water partitioning, especially of MeHg. Sediments
   with low native sediment:water MeHg partition coefficients were most
   effectively treated. Thus, in situ sediment sorbent amendments may be
   able to reduce the risk of biotic Hg and MeHg uptake in contaminated
   sediments, and subsequent contamination of food webs.}},

Abstract = {{This study reveals the peculiar in vivo cell kinetics and cell turnover
   of the marine sponge Halisarca caerulea under steady-state conditions.
   The tropical coral reef sponge shows an extremely high proliferation
   activity, a short cell cycle duration and massive cell shedding. Cell
   turnover is predominantly confined to a single cell population, i.e. the
   choanocytes, and in this process apoptosis only plays a minor role. To
   our knowledge, such fast cell kinetics under steady-state conditions,
   with high turnover by shedding in the absence of apoptosis, has not been
   observed previously in any other multicellular organism. The duration of
   the cell cycle in vivo resembles that of unicellular organisms in
   culture. Morphological and histochemical studies demonstrate
   compartmentalization of choanocytes in the sponge tissue, which
   corresponds well with its remarkable cellular kinetics. Coral reef
   cavity sponges, like H. caerulea, inhabit low nutrient tropical waters,
   forcing these organisms to filter large volumes of water and to capture
   the few nutrients efficiently. Under these oligotrophic conditions, a
   high cell turnover may be considered as a very useful strategy,
   preventing permanent damage to the sponge by environmental stress.
   Halisarca caerulea maintains its body mass and keeps its food uptake
   system up to date by constantly renewing its filter system. We conclude
   that studies on cell kinetics and functional morphology provide new and
   essential information on the growth characteristics and the regulation
   of sponge growth in vivo as well as in vitro and the role of choanocytes
   in tissue homeostasis.}},

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{36}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{The present study shows a previously undocumented role of dissolved
   organic matter in the marine carbonate system. During photosynthesis,
   phytoplankton release dissolved organic compounds containing basic
   functional groups that readily react with protons during seawater
   titration, and thereby contribute to alkalinity (a measure of buffering
   capacity). The magnitude of the contribution of dissolved organic
   compounds to seawater alkalinity is species dependent, suggesting that
   individual phytoplankton species exude dissolved organic compounds with
   unique proton accepting capacities. Our study shows that dissolved
   organic matter produced by marine phytoplankton during photosynthesis is
   a newly identified buffering component in the ocean, and indicates that
   the contribution of dissolved organic matter to seawater alkalinity can
   be significant in the biologically productive upper ocean, where to date
   it has been unrecognized or considered insignificant. Citation: Kim,

Title = {{JEM Spotlight: Monitoring the treatment efficiency of a full scale
   ozonation on a sewage treatment plant with a mode-of-action based test
   battery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Tertiary treatment of wastewater with ozone is a promising technique for
   removing residual micropollutants that remain after secondary biological
   treatment. We monitored the performance of a full-scale ozonation
   reactor on a sewage treatment plant in Switzerland with a screening
   battery of bioassays. Six toxicity endpoints were selected that covered
   non-specific toxicity, as well as selected receptor-mediated modes of
   action and reactive toxicity. Non-specific toxicity was assessed with
   two bioassays, the bioluminescence inhibition of the marine luminescent
   bacterium Vibrio Fischeri and the growth inhibition of the green algae
   Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. Treatment efficiency was around 90\%
   for the secondary treatment, but only 65\% and 76\% for the ozonation
   step in the two nonspecific endpoints, respectively. This finding is
   consistent with this type of oxidation reaction because ozone only
   modifies the organic molecules but does not mineralize them fully
   leaving residual toxicity of the transformation products. In contrast,
   the specific receptor-mediated endpoints of inhibition of photosystem II
   in algae and estrogenicity were largely reduced by ozonation. While
   compounds inhibiting photosynthesis proved to be rather recalcitrant
   toward biological treatment with only 47\% removal, an additional 86\%
   removal by ozonation yielded an overall treatment efficiency in the
   entire treatment chain of 89\%. The effect on estrogenicity, quantified
   with the yeast estrogen screen, was even more significant: A treatment
   efficiency of 95\% in the secondary treatment, 86\% during ozonation
   plus a small effect by biological sand filtration yielded an overall
   treatment efficiency of 99.5\%. Insecticides that inhibit
   acetylcholinesterase were fairly resistant to degradation, but an
   overall treatment efficiency of 91\% was achieved in two steps: 72\% in
   biological treatment and 60\% during ozonation. Finally, no significant
   genotoxicity was observed with the umuC test after ozonation, while the
   influent showed a genotoxic response when it was enriched by a factor of
   15 to 60. Treatment efficiency increased with the ozone dose and
   remained virtually unchanged over ozone doses above 500 g ozone per kg
   dissolved organic carbon. The reduction of toxicity can be rationalized
   by the chemical oxidation processes likely to occur for each group of
   chemicals that are typical for a given mode of toxic action. For
   comparison, tertiary treatment with powdered activated carbon was also
   evaluated, which poses a viable alternative to ozonation with respect to
   removal of micropollutants.}},

Abstract = {{dSix structurally distinct polysaccharides were fluorescently labeled
   and used to compare potential hydrolysis rates and substrate
   specificities of extracellular enzymes in bottom water and surface
   sediments. Potential hydrolysis rates differed by factors of 10-100
   among the six polysaccharides. The relative order of potential
   hydrolysis rates in sediments was distinctly different from that of the
   bottom water samples. In surface sediments, pullulan hydrolysis was
   extremely rapid, and relative hydrolysis rates decreased in the order
   pullulan >> laminarin > chondroitin sulfate > xylan > arahinogalactan >>
   fucoidan. In bottom water, in contrast, pullulan, arabinogalactan, and
   fucoidan were barely hydrolyzed, whereas chondroitin sulfate, xylan, and
   laminarin were hydrolyzed relatively rapidly. Hydrolysis rates decreased
   in the order xylan > chondroitin sulfate > laminarin >>> arahinogalactan
   congruent to pullulan congruent to fucoidan. The differences among the
   relative hydrolysis rates might reflect fundamental differences in
   seawater and sedimentary microbial communities with disparate
   extracellular enzymatic capabilities. Carbohydrates are significant
   constituents of dissolved organic carbon in seawater and are detectable
   as molecularly distinct structures in sediments of significant geologic
   age. Slow hydrolysis may provide the time required for geochemical
   transformations that further increase resistance to remineralization.}},

Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{112-120}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The potential of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) in the
   aquaculture industry is increasingly being acknowledged. Along with
   intensified application, the need to better characterise and understand
   the accumulated dissolved organic matter (DOM) within these systems
   increases. Mature RASs, stocked with rainbow trout and operated at
   steady state at four feed loadings, were analysed by dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) analysis and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM)
   spectroscopy. The fluorescence dataset was then decomposed by PARAFAC
   analysis using the drEEM toolbox. This revealed that the fluorescence
   character of the RAS water could be represented by five components, of
   which four have previously been identified in fresh water, coastal
   marine water, wetlands and drinking water. The fluorescence components
   as well as the DOC showed positive correlations with feed loading,
   however there was considerable variation between the five fluorescence
   components with respect to the degree of accumulation with feed loading.
   The five components were found to originate from three sources: the
   feed; the influent tap water (groundwater); and processes related to the
   fish and the water treatment system. This paper details the first
   application of fluorescence EEM spectroscopy to assess DOM in RAS, and
   highlights the potential applications of this technique within future
   RAS management strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1962-1973}},

Abstract = {{In addition to the cyanobacterial N-2-fixers (diazotrophs), there is a
   high nifH gene diversity of non-cyanobacterial groups present in marine
   environments, yet quantitative information about these groups is scarce.
   N-2 fixation potential (nifH gene expression), diversity and
   distributions of the uncultivated diazotroph phylotype gamma-24774A11, a
   putative gammaproteobacterium, were investigated in the western South
   Pacific Ocean. gamma-24774A11 gene copies correlated positively with
   diazotrophic cyanobacteria, temperature, dissolved organic carbon and
   ambient O-2 saturation, and negatively with depth, chlorophyll a and
   nutrients, suggesting that carbon supply, access to light or inhibitory
   effects of DIN may control gamma-24774A11 abundances. Maximum nifH
   gene-copy abundance was 2 x 10(4) I-1, two orders of magnitude less than
   that for diazotrophic cyanobacteria, while the median gamma-24774A11
   abundance, 8 x 10(2) I-1, was greater than that for the UCYN-A
   cyanobacteria, suggesting a more homogeneous distribution in surface
   waters. The abundance of nifH transcripts by gamma-24774A11 was greater
   during the night than during the day, and the transcripts generally
   ranged from 0-7\%, but were up to 26\% of all nifH transcripts at each
   station. The ubiquitous presence and low variability of gamma-24774A11
   abundances across tropical and subtropical oceans, combined with the
   consistent nifH expression reported in this study, suggest that
   gamma-24774A11 could be one of the most important heterotrophic (or
   photoheterotrophic) diazotrophs and may need to be considered in future
   N budget estimates and models.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon and nitrogen uptake in a microbial community comprising bacteria
   and microalgae in a sandy marine sediment under nutrient-limited and
   -replete conditions was studied using a mesocosm approach. After 2 wk of
   incubation, a pulse of (HCO3-)-C-13 and (NH4+)-N-15 was added to the
   mesocosms, and subsequent uptake of C-13 and N-15 by bacteria and
   microphytobenthos (MPB) was traced by analysis of C-13 and N-15
   incorporation into hydrolysable amino acids, including the bacterial
   biomarker D-alanine. The results confirm that MPB communities are
   capable of sustained high rates of photosynthesis despite nutrient
   limitation. Under these conditions cellular growth stops (as defined by
   the synthesis of chlorophyll a and amino acids) and the carbon fixed
   under such conditions consists predominantly of carbohydrates produced
   through `overflow metabolism'. In the treatment with nutrient addition,
   algal growth was stimulated and label incorporation was more balanced,
   with carbohydrates accounting for a much smaller fraction of newly fixed
   organic carbon. There was close agreement between net C fixation based
   on O-2 fluxes and the increase of particulate organic carbon in the
   sediment under bath nutrient-limited and -replete conditions. This
   finding suggests that very little fixed C was lost to the water column
   as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), consistent with direct measurements
   of DOC release using. There was a significant and rapid transfer of C-13
   from the MPB to bacterial biomass in both treatments within 24 h of
   label addition, revealing that fixed carbon excreted by MPB was rapidly
   utilised by bacteria. In both treatments, bacteria incorporated a
   significant fraction of N-15 from (NH4+)-N-15, with the greatest
   incorporation being observed under nutrient limited conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined the partitioning of organic matter in
   upwelling systems, despite the fact that these systems play a key role
   in carbon and nitrogen budgets in the ocean. We examined the production
   and partitioning of phytoplankton-derived organic matter in deck
   incubations off Oregon during the upwelling season. During exponential
   growth of the phytoplankton, greater than or equal to78\% of total
   accumulated organic matter was in particulate (POM) form. This suggests
   that dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a small fraction of primary
   production during the exponential growth of coastal phytoplankton
   blooms. After nitrate depletion, carbon-rich (C: N greater than or equal
   to 16) DOM accumulated in incubations dominated by the diatom
   Chaetoceros sp., accounting for 38\% (+/-8.5\%) of accumulated total
   organic carbon (TOC) and 24\% (+/-8\%) of accumulated total organic
   nitrogen (TON). However, in a bloom dominated by the diatom
   Leptocylindrus mimmus, a relatively smaller amount of DOM accumulated,
   accounting for only 15\% of accumulated TOC and 7\% of accumulated TON.
   On the basis of measured concentrations of nitrate and accumulated TOC,
   similar to70\%-157\% more carbon was fixed than would be predicted by
   Redfield stoichiometry (referred to as ``excess carbon fixation{''}),
   with 20\%-69\% of the excess carbon fixation occurring after nitrate
   depletion. The accumulation of carbon-rich DOM and excess carbon
   fixation suggests that nitrate assimilation (i.e., new production) might
   not equate to net production of POM in coastal upwelling systems.}},

   study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{473-495}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Relationships between bacterial and primary production in the eastern
   and western basins of the Mediterranean Sea are different. In this
   study, a ID coupled ecosystem model is used to simulate primary and
   bacterial production along the west-east trophic gradient and to
   ascertain the physical and biogeochemical controls that determine
   regional variations in production. Simulations demonstrate differences
   in ecosystem function between the western and eastern basins of the
   Mediterranean Sea at the level of bacterial and primary production.
   Vertical mixing processes (deep mixing and convection), particularly in
   late winter, are crucial in determining total annual production in both
   basins, and the dissolved organic carbon pool, from which bacteria
   obtain their carbon, is derived from autotrophic rather than
   heterotrophic activity. Bacterial production is nutrient limited in the
   cast, and may be grazer controlled in the west. The dissolved organic
   nutrient pools are derived from heterotrophic rather than autotrophic
   activity. The eastern basin is characterised by strong competition
   between phytoplankton and bacteria for nutrients whereas the western
   basin is characterised by relatively high levels of heterotrophic
   activity. Nitrogen and phosphate uptake by phytoplankton is biologically
   important in both basins, whereas bacterial uptake of these is only
   important in the eastern basin. A generic model parameterisation
   produces simulation results which concur with recent observations
   although simulated production rates are very sensitive to the initial
   conditions upon which those simulations are based. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Exposure of riverine waters to natural sunlight initiated alterations in
   stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) of the associated dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC). Water samples were collected from two
   compositionally distinct coastal river systems in the southeastern
   United States-the Satilla River which has high DOC concentrations (10-35
   mg/l), and the Altamaha River which has relatively low DOC
   concentrations (3-9 mg/l). Approximately 21-26\% of the DOC was
   remineralized to DIC. The delta C-13 of remineralized DIC was
   isotopically ``light{''} (delta C-13 = -28.8 to -33.2 parts per
   thousand) relative to the initial DOC (delta C-13 = -27.4 parts per
   thousand), leaving a residual fraction of isotopically ``heavy{''}
   (delta C-13 = -25.8 to -26.6 parts per thousand) DOC.
   Photochemically-induced fractionation of C-13 results from selective
   degradation of certain biochemical constituents including lignin
   phenols. These results are consistent with shifts in VC of DOC observed
   during mixing of river and marine waters, suggesting that
   photochemically-induced alterations are a factor in determining these

Journal = {{PHOTOSYNTHETICA}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{111-126}},
Abstract = {{Primary productivity in marine waters is widely estimated by the
   measurements of C-14 incorporation, the underwater light climate, and
   the absorption spectra of phytoplankton. In bio-optical models the
   quantum efficiency of carbon fixation derived from C-14 incorporation
   rates, the photosynthetically absorbed radiation derived from the
   underwater light climate, and the phytoplankton absorption spectra are
   used to calculate time- and depth-integrated primary productivity. Due
   to the increased sensitivity of commercially available fluorometers,
   chlorophyll a in vivo fluorescence became a new tool to assess the
   photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton. Since fluorescence data yield
   only relative photosynthetic electron transport rates, a direct
   conversion into absolute carbon fixation rates is not possible. Here, we
   report a procedure how this problem can be adressed in freshwater
   phytoplankton. We adapted a marine bio-optical model to the freshwater
   situation and tested if this model yields realistic results when applied
   to a hypertrophic freshwater reservoir. Comparison of primary
   productivity derived from C-14 incorporation to primary productivity
   derived from Chi a fluorescence showed that the conversion of
   fluorescence data into carbon fixation rates is still an unsolved
   problem. Absolute electron transport rates calculated from fluorescence
   data tend to overestimate primary production. We propose that the
   observed differences are caused mainly by neglecting the package effect
   of pigments in phytoplankton cells and by non-carbon related electron
   flow (e.g., nitrogen fixation). On the other hand, the C-14
   incorporation rates can be artificially influenced by `'bottle
   effects{''}, especially near the water surface, where photoinhibition,
   photorespiration, and Mehler reaction can play a major role.}},

Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{66}},

Pages = {{53-79}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of diagenesis and benthic biogeochemical cycling
   were studied at six stations in the Northern Adriatic during September,
   1988. The objectives of this work were to quantify the mechanisms
   responsible for mass transport and to establish the stoichiometry of
   reactions involving carbon and nutrients. Stations were chosen to
   include sites near the Po delta that have rapid sediment accumulation,
   sites south of the Po delta that lie beneath its nutrient-rich plume but
   beyond the region of rapid accumulation, and one site further offshore
   in a zone with little or no modern sediment accumulation. Benthic flux
   measurements of oxygen, TCO2, ammonia, alkalinity, phosphate, silicate
   and radon were made at five of the study sites. Synthesis of this data
   shows that fluxes of oxygen and nutrients are similar at both high and
   low accumulation rate sites, but that the offshore site has fluxes that
   are at least two times smaller for all parameters except silica and
   radon. Cores were collected, and analyses of solid phases (organic
   carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, total and organic phosphorus, and Pb-210) and
   pore waters (alkalinity, pH, ammonia, sillica, calcium, iron, and
   phosphate) were carried out. Calculations indicated that pore waters
   were near equilibrium or slightly supersaturated with calcite,
   supersaturated with apatite, and undersaturated with vivianite. Pore
   water profiles of TCO2 and silica were used to calculate diffusive
   fluxes across the sediment-water interface. Comparison of these
   calculated fluxes to in situ flux measurements indicated solute
   transport at the rapid accumulation sites is dominated by diffusive
   fluxes, while at the other sites about half is accomplished by
   irrigation; the contrast reflects the abundance of macrofauna. Rate
   constants for organic matter degradation were estimated and reflect the
   presence of fractions with mean lifetimes from a few months to several
   years. Diagenetic stoichiometry is dominated by degradation of organic
   carbon, which accounts for about 95\% of the TCO2 flux. Ultimately,
   oxygen is the principal terminal electron acceptor, although ferric
   iron, nitrate and sulfate must be important intermediates. Carbonate
   dissolution accounts for the remaining 5\% of the TCO2 flux. The average
   C/N ratio of degrading organic material derived from pore water profiles
   of TCO2 and ammonia is 5 +/- 2; this is 30-50\% of the ratio measured in
   solid phases, demonstrating preferential degradation of compounds rich
   in N. However, the C/N ratio observed in flux measurements averages 11.0
   +/- 1.7, suggesting that about half of the fixed nitrogen remineralized
   is lost as N-2 during diagenesis. The TCO2/alkalinity diagenetic ratio
   in the anoxic pore waters was uniform at all sites and averaged 1.11 +/-
   0.02 mol/equivalent, a result 30\% greater than predicted for the
   formation of FeS2 via sulfate reduction with ferric hydroxide as the
   iron source. Several explanations for this difference are possible. The
   observed ratio is more consistent with precipitation of FeS using ferric
   hydroxide as an iron source; additional factors may be preferential
   de-carboxylation of organic matter or proton uptake by DOC during
   alkalinity titrations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A highly sensitive stopped flow chemiluminescence method has been
   developed for the analysis of Fe(II) at subnanomolar levels in seawater.
   Oxidation of Fe(II) by O-2 in the absence of H2O2 is used to catalyze
   luminol chemiluminescence. The sample and luminol reagent are
   pneumatically injected into a 1 cm flow cell positioned in front of a
   photomultiplier tube. The luminescence intensity is measured with a
   picoammeter and recorded on a personal computer. Fe(II) can be
   determined directly in open ocean and coastal waters with 5 ml of
   sample. Interference studies were conducted with Cr(III), Fe(III),
   Cu(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), Co(II), and Ni(II). Ni(II), Cr(III), and Fe(III)
   did not exhibit a significant interference over the concentration range
   5 to 500 nmol/kg. Mn(II) and Cu(II) caused a reduction in signal at all
   levels greater than 5 nmol/kg. Zn(II) and Co(II) produced an
   interference only when their concentrations were 100 times or more that
   of Fe(II), resulting in an enhanced signal. Dissolved organic matter
   reduced the sensitivity of the method in coastal waters relative to open
   ocean waters. The detection limit for Fe(II) with a 200 mu l sample
   injection volume is 0.06 nmol/kg in open ocean waters and 0.15 nmol/kg
   in coastal waters. The relative standard deviation of three replicates
   is +/- 8\%. Direct application to seawater is accomplished with a
   minimum of post-sampling manipulations or chemical treatments. In
   addition the reducible iron concentration can be determined by reduction
   with sulfite. The instrumentation required is easily adapted for field
   use.}},

Abstract = {{The progress during the past 10-15 years in the studies of organic
   macromolecules (humic substances, HS) in seawater and sediments is
   reviewed. The review describes the advances in the characterization of
   seawater and sedimentary HS, HS formation models, studies on the
   geochemical role of marine HS, and future research needs.
   A macroreticular polystyrene resin (e.g. Amberlite XAD-2) has been
   generally used to isolate seawater HS. The HS isolated from seawater or
   sediments have been characterized by the analysis of lignin-phenols from
   CuO degradation, 1H and 13C NMR, stable carbon isotope analysis,
   pyrolysis-GCMS etc. The major conclusions of these analyses are: (1)
   seawater HS are essentially aliphatic and thought to be of phytoplankton
   origin and (2) sedimentary HS also have an aliphatic structure. The
   formation model of marine (both seawater and sedimentary) HS may be
   categorized into two groups: small molecular polymerization model which
   assumes that biopolymers are first degraded to small molecules and then
   re-polymerize to produce HS; and biopolymer degradation and
   polymerization model which assumes that HS are mainly or partly composed
   of refractory biopolymers and reaction products among refractory
   biopolymers, modified biopolymers, regenerated molecules, and the
   refractory biopolymers and their modified ones are the basic building
   blocks of humin (insoluble fraction of HS). However, analytical data are
   still insufficient to draw the conclusion.
   The effort to isolate a large amount of seawater HS and characterize
   both seawater HS and sedimentary HS by chemical and physical methods,
   which should be done with the active participation of biochemists, is
   strongly needed to draw the picture of chemical structure of marine HS
   and to confirm the HS formation models.}},

   complexation in water column of the stratified Krka River estuary

Abstract = {{An interaction of dissolved natural organic matter (DNOM) with copper
   ions in the water column of the stratified Krka River estuary (Croatia)
   was studied. The experimental methodology was based on the differential
   pulse anodic stripping voltammetric (DPASV) determination of labile
   copper species by titrating the sample using increments of copper
   additions uniformly distributed on the logarithmic scale. A classical
   at-equilibrium approach (determination of copper complexing capacity,
   CuCC) and a kinetic approach (tracing of equilibrium reconstitution) of
   copper complexation were considered and compared. A model of discrete
   distribution of organic ligands forming inert copper complexes was
   applied. For both approaches, a home-written fitting program was used
   for the determination of apparent stability constants (K-i(equ)), total
   ligands concentration (L-iT) and association/dissociation rate constants
   (k(i)(1),k(i)(-1)).
   A non-conservative behaviour of dissolved organic matter (DOC) and total
   copper concentration in a water column was registered. An enhanced
   biological activity at the freshwater-seawater interface (FSI) triggered
   an increase of total copper concentration and total ligand concentration
   in this water layer. The copper complexation in fresh water of Krka
   River was characterised by one type of binding ligands, while in most of
   the estuarine and marine samples two classes of ligands were identified.
   The distribution of apparent stability constants (log K-i(equ):
   11.2-13.0, log K-2(equ):8.8-10.0) showed increasing trend towards higher
   salinities, indicating stronger copper complexation by autochthonous
   seawater organic matter.
   Copper complexation parameters (ligand concentrations and apparent
   stability constants) obtained by at-equilibrium model are in very good
   accordance with those of kinetic model. Calculated association rate
   constants (k(1)(1):6.1-20 x 10(3) (M s)(-1), k(2)(1) : 1.3-6.3 x 10(3)
   (M s)(-1)) indicate that copper complexation by DNOM takes place
   relatively slowly. The time needed to achieve a new pseudo-equilibrium
   induced by an increase of copper concentration (which is common for Krka
   River estuary during summer period due to the nautical traffic), is
   estimated to be from 2 to 4 h.
   It is found that in such oligotrophic environment (dissolved organic
   carbon content under 83 mu M-C. i.e. 1 mg(C)L(-1)) an increase of the
   total copper concentration above 12 nM could enhance a free copper
   concentration exceeding the level considered as potentially toxic for
   microorganisms (10 pM). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the long-term photochemical and microbial decomposition
   of biologically recalcitrant humic-like dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   leached from a vascular wetland plant, the common rush (Juncus effusus).
   Although the leachate would have been characterized as biologically
   recalcitrant by short-term (<14 d) bioassays, microbes decomposed 51\%
   of its organic carbon in 898 d with a first-order biological
   decomposition coefficient of 0.0008 d(-1) in darkness. Solar radiation
   exposure accelerated the decomposition of leachate. Under 459-d exposure
   to surface solar radiation, up to 90\% of organic carbon was
   mineralized. During the exposure, the photochemical reactions
   preferentially mineralized the C-12 fraction of organic carbon and
   enriched the C-13 of organic carbon by 6\% in the residual leachate.
   Solar radiation also decomposed nearly completely (up to 99.7\%) chromo-
   and fluorophores of DOM. A 439-d bioassay following the solar radiation
   exposure resulted in up to 97.3\% mineralization of organic carbon.
   Solar radiation together with microbial metabolism can completely
   mineralize at least some forms of wetland-derived DOM in surface waters
   with sufficiently long residence times.}},

Abstract = {{We report over 600 absorption spectra (250-800 nm) of unfiltered surface
   waters, < 250m depth, collected at daily stations during three Atlantic
   Meridional Transect cruises (AMT9, 10, 11) between the UK and Uruguay.
   AMT cruises 9 and 11 were southbound (15 September 1999-13 October 1999
   and 12 September 2000-11 October 2000, respectively), while AMT 10 was
   northbound (12 April 2000-8 May 2000). Absorption coefficients at 300nm,
   alpha(300), ranged from 0.13 to 1.32m(-1), showed insignificant
   differences between filtered and unfiltered samples, and were therefore
   attributed to chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). A non-linear
   single exponential regression provided the best fit to our CDOM
   absorbance spectra and was used to parameterise the spectral slope, S,
   of the monotonic absorbance decrease with increasing wavelength over the
   wavelength ranges 290-350 nm (S290-350) and 250-650 nm (S250-650). We
   observed distinct patterns in the latitudinal and depth distribution of
   CDOM absorbance characteristics. Distinct subsurface alpha 300 maxima,
   characterised by lowest spectral slope values (S290-350 = 0.010 nm(-1)
   and S250-650 = 0.014 nm(-1)) were observed in the vicinity of the deep
   chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in open ocean and upwelling regions, and
   indicated in-situ production of CDOM. Converserly, the surface alpha 300
   minima and surface S290-350 and S250-650 maxima in these regions were
   attributed to CDOM photo-oxidation. In order to assess the nature of the
   observed CDOM variability along our AMT transects, we grouped our data
   into 12 individual, oceanographic provinces, and further into two
   seasons (spring: April-May, and Autumn: September-October) and three
   depth zones (surface mixed layer, pycnocline, and below pycnocline).
   Comparisons between individual provinces, seasons and depth zones
   indicated that CDOM variability was dominated by regional factors and
   depth distribution patterns, while seasonal variability was generally
   less important in our data. Based on depth distribution patterns
   together with analyses of inter-relations between alpha 300, and
   S290-350, S250-650 we propose that our data reflect the presence of two
   CDOM end-members, each characterised by distinct spectral slope factors,
   S290-350 and S250-650. The first CDOM end-member (S290-350 = 0.010 and
   S250-650 = 0.014 nm(-1)) was situated in the vicinity of the DCM, and
   was attributed to CDOM production from phytoplankton-derived organic
   matter via planktonic foodweb interactions. The second end-member
   (S290-350 = 0.028 nm(-1) and S250-650 = 0.029 nm(-1)) was attributed to
   microbial CDOM production. We propose that the CDOM distribution along
   the AMT cruise track is controlled by autochthonous production near the
   DCM and subsequent photo-oxidation in surface waters. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{1. The significance of microbial diversity in processing dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) is largely unknown. We investigated the range of
   functional diversity in the bacterioplankton from a eutrophic river by
   profiling extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) and substrate-induced
   respiration (SIR) patterns.
   2. The EEA profiles consisted of assays for 21 hydrolases, measured
   using fluorogenic substrates arrayed on 96-well microplates.
   Commercially available BiOLOG(R) GN and ECO plates, which contained 120
   different substrates, were used for the SIR profiles.
   3. The EEA data were more dynamic than the SIR. Five enzymes, leucine
   aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminopeptidase, arginine
   aminopeptidase and P-glucosidase, showed consistently high activity; ten
   others were ubiquitous at lower activity levels; the remainder were
   detected intermittently. The SIR data showed less temporal variability.
   With one exception (citrate), the 20 substrates that generated the
   largest responses were all saccharides or their derivatives.
   4. The EEA and SIR data did not generally correlate. Both methods were
   effective for ordinating bacterioplankton although, unlike the SIR, the
   EEA ordination followed a clear temporal trajectory.
   5. Because the SIR profiles are based on a culture response, whilst the
   EEA profiles measure activity of the extant community, the latter appear
   to be more directly linked to the mechanics of DOM processing.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive iodine compounds play a significant role in the atmospheric
   chemistry of the oceanic boundary layer by influencing the oxidising
   capacity through catalytically removing O-3 and altering the HOx and NOx
   balance. The sea-to-air flux of iodine over the open ocean is therefore
   an important quantity in assessing these impacts on a global scale. This
   paper examines the effect of a number of relevant environmental
   parameters, including water temperature, salinity and organic compounds,
   on the magnitude of the HOI and I-2 fluxes produced from the uptake of
   O-3 and its reaction with iodide ions in aqueous solution. The results
   of these laboratory experiments and those reported previously (Carpenter
   et al., 2013), along with sea surface iodide concentrations measured or
   inferred from measurements of dissolved total iodine and iodate reported
   in the literature, were then used to produce parameterised expressions
   for the HOI and I-2 fluxes as a function of wind speed, sea-surface
   temperature and O-3. These expressions were used in the Tropospheric
   HAlogen chemistry MOdel (THAMO) to compare with MAX-DOAS measurements of
   iodine monoxide (IO) performed during the HaloCAST-P cruise in the
   eastern Pacific ocean (Mahajan et al., 2012). The modelled IO agrees
   reasonably with the field observations, although significant
   discrepancies are found during a period of low wind speeds (< 3 m
   s(-1)), when the model overpredicts IO by up to a factor of 3. The
   inorganic iodine flux contributions to IO are found to be comparable to,
   or even greater than, the contribution of organo-iodine compounds and
   therefore its inclusion in atmospheric models is important to improve
   predictions of the influence of halogen chemistry in the marine boundary
   layer.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research indicates that coral reef associated benthic algae may
   control important metabolic processes in reef ecosystems via organic
   matter release. Yet little information is available about quantity and
   chemical composition of these algae-derived exudates. Therefore first
   comprehensive studies on algal organic matter release were conducted at
   a fringing reef ecosystem in the Northern Red Sea. Dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PN) release
   by dominant reef associated benthic algae (Caulerpa serrulata,
   Peyssonnelia capensis, turf algae assemblages) were quantified during 4
   seasonally resolved expeditions. Additionally, 4 seasonal blooming (Ulva
   lactuca, Enteromorpha flexuosa, Liagora turneri, Hydroclathrus
   clathratus) and 2 patchy growing algae species (Lobophora variegata,
   Saragassum dentifolium) were included in these investigations. To
   complement the dataset organic matter release by Caulerpa was studied
   under different light conditions, simulating water depths of 1, 5, 10
   and 20 m. Environmental parameters (temperature, light availability,
   inorganic nutrient concentrations) were monitored simultaneously to
   assess potential effects on algal organic matter release. All 9
   investigated genera of benthic algae exuded DOC and POC in amounts of
   12.2 +/- 2.1 and 4.2 +/- 0.3 mg organic C m(-2) algae surface area
   h(-1), respectively. Resident algae, primarily turf algae assemblages,
   displayed highest and seasonal blooming algae lowest organic matter
   release rates. Results therefore indicate that organic matter release
   rates are rather influenced by functional properties (growth form, life
   strategy) of algae than by taxonomic affiliation. Quantities of organic
   matter release showed seasonal and depth-mediated variations and were
   positively correlated with temperature and light availability within
   photosynthetically active radiation intensities of 0 to 300 mu mol
   quanta m(-2) s(-1), suggesting photoinhibition as limiting factor for
   productivity and subsequent organic matter release. Stable isotope
   signatures of algae-derived organic carbon were within a common range
   and likewise subjected to seasonal variations (delta C-13 summer: -11.2
   parts per thousand +/- 0.2 parts per thousand; delta 13 winter: -16.7
   parts per thousand +/- 0.4 parts per thousand). These data provide first
   comprehensive information about a) the potential contribution of
   different benthic reef algae to cycles of matter and b) environmental
   key factors influencing organic matter release by benthic algae in the
   investigated fringing reef ecosystem. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The ubiquity and high productivity associated with blooms of colonial
   Phaeocystis makes it an important contributor to the global carbon
   cycle. During blooms organic matter that is rich in carbohydrates is
   produced. We distinguish five different pools of carbohydrates produced
   by Phaeocystis. Like all plants and algal cells, both solitary and
   colonial cells produce (1) structural carbohydrates, (hetero)
   polysaccharides that are mainly part of the cell wall, (2) mono- and
   oligosaccharides, which are present as intermediates in the synthesis
   and catabolism of cell components, and (3) intracellular storage glucan.
   Colonial cells of Phaeocystis excrete (4) mucopolysaccharides,
   heteropolysaccharides that are the main constituent of the mucous colony
   matrix and (5) dissolved organic matter (DOM) rich in carbohydrates,
   which is mainly excreted by colonial cells. In this review the
   characteristics of these pools are discussed and quantitative data are
   summarized. During the exponential growth phase, the ratio of
   carbohydrate-carbon (C) to particulate organic carbon (POC) is
   approximately 0.1. When nutrients are limited, Phaeocystis blooms reach
   a stationary growth phase, during which excess energy is stored as
   carbohydrates. This so-called overflow metabolism increases the ratio of
   carbohydrate-C to POC to 0.4-0.6 during the stationary phase, leading to
   an increase in the C/N and C/P ratios of Phaeocystis organic matter.
   Overflow metabolism can be channeled towards both glucan and
   mucopolysaccharides. Summarizing the available data reveals that during
   the stationary phase of a bloom glucan contributes 0-51\% to POC,
   whereas mucopolysaccharides contribute 5-60\%. At the end of a bloom,
   lysis of Phaeocystis cells and deterioration of colonies leads to a
   massive release of DOM rich in glucan and mucopolysaccharides.
   Laboratory studies have revealed that this organic matter is potentially
   readily degradable by heterotrophic bacteria. However, observations in
   the field of accumulation of DOM and foam indicate that microbial
   degradation is hampered. The high C/N and C/P ratios of Phaeocystis
   organic matter may lead to nutrient limitation of microbial degradation,
   thereby prolonging degradation times. Over time polysaccharides tend to
   self-assemble into hydrogels. This may have a profound effect on carbon
   cycling, since hydrogels provide a vehicle to move DOM up the size
   spectrum to sizes subject to sedimentation. In addition, it changes the
   physical nature and microscale structure of the organic matter
   encountered by bacteria which may affect the degradation potential of
   the Phaeocystis organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{River-dominated coastal areas are typically sites of active
   biogeochemical cycling, with productivity enhanced by terrestrial inputs
   of nutrients and organic matter. To examine the spatial variability and
   relationship between river discharge, phytoplankton, and organic carbon
   distributions, we analyzed surface water and sediment from the Louisiana
   shelf adjacent to the Mississippi River. Samples were collected during
   April and October 2000 to capture high and low river discharge, and were
   analyzed for dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC),
   nutrients, and phytoplankton pigments. Pigments, determined by high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), were also analyzed from
   sediment to evaluate marine carbon inputs to the seafloor. DOC in
   surface waters was generally within 200-300 mu M, ranging up to 399 mu
   M. Chlorophyll a ranged from below the limits of detection (BLD) up to
   31 nM in surface waters, with higher values located further from the
   river mouth during high flow. Although community diversity increased
   during low discharge, diatoms dominated the phytoplankton population
   (50-80\% of the community throughout the study) and consequently made
   more important contributions than other species to both the DOC and POC
   pools. Chlorophyll and degradation products (indicative of zooplankton
   grazing) observed in surface sediment indicated a transfer of
   autochthonous carbon from the highly productive photic zone to the
   sediment, coupling phytoplankton-derived POC in surface waters with
   organic carbon deposition in surface sediment. Cross-shelf changes in
   chlorophyll indicated a westward transport of phytoplankton that was
   directly and indirectly linked with river discharge and pigment decay
   dynamics. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal organic particles constitute the dominant portion of
   particulate organic matter in surface seawater, but their influence on
   the phase speciation and bioavailability of hydrophobic organic
   compounds (HOCs) is sparsely evaluated. Studies on colloid-water
   partitioning have been focused on other regimes and have largely been
   performed on chemically defined subportions of total colloids such as
   the humic fraction. Available estimates of colloid-water partition
   coeffficients (K-coc) are highly variable and not easily explained by
   regularly applied K-ow-K-oc relationships. Here, pyrene was partitioned
   to bulk natural colloids isolated using cross-flow ultrafiltration
   techniques from the surface water of a coastal bay. A key objective was
   to elucidate biogeochemical controls on the changing colloid-sorbent
   qualities over the course of the dynamic allochtonous-autochtonous
   transition of a well-constrained boreal coastal spring bloom. The pyrene
   K-coc was found to decrease from 12.9 +/- 0.9 x 10(3) L-w/kg(oc) in the
   terrestrial runoff dominated regime to values around 2.9 +/- 0.7 x 10(3)
   L-w/kg(oc), once phytoplankton production became the governing source of
   organic matter to the surface waters. The changing K-coc was well
   correlated with the molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of the
   colloidal organic carbon. This study supports other reports of an
   improved prediction of HOC phase speciation through this simple
   molecular proxy of the ``quality{''} of organic sorbents. While being
   poor sorbents on a carbon atom basis, relative to soils and sediments,
   coastal marine colloids, by their shear abundance, may significantly
   attenuate the truly dissolved exposures of HOCs with log K-ow above 5.}},

   not vary by more than a factor of similar to 2-3 over a 3-4 order of
   magnitude range in C-ox values. The causes of this are not well
   understood, but may be related to specific effects associated with the
   remineralization of highly altered organic matter mixtures under aerobic
   conditions. Dissolved carbohydrates (DCHOs) in these sediment pore
   waters ranged from similar to 30 to 400 mu M, increased with depth in a
   manner similar to total DOG, and represented similar to 10 to 55\% of
   pore water DOC. In Chesapeake Bay sediments this percentage decreased
   with sediment depth, while in these continental margin sediments it was
   constant (upper 30 cm). Of the DCHOs in these pore waters similar to 30
   to 50\% could be identified as individual aldoses (monomeric neutral
   sugars), and total aldose yields (individual aldoses as a percentage of
   total DOG) were higher in these continental margin sediment pore waters
   (>9\%) than they were in the estuarine sediment pore waters (<5\%). A
   comparison of DCHO and PCHO concentrations in these sediments indicates
   that their concentrations are uncoupled, and that pore water DCHO
   concentrations are primarily controlled by sediment remineralization
   processes. Pore water DCHOs appeared to be preferentially found in the
   high molecular weight (HMW) DOC pool, and likely occur as some of the
   initial HMW intermediates produced and consumed during sediment POC
   remineralization. These results also support past suggestions about the
   differing controls on carbon remineralization processes in continental
   margin versus estuarine sediments. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Relationship between ultraviolet (UV) radiation and mycosporine-like

Journal = {{BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{63}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Although only about 5-7\% of solar radiation reaching the earth's
   surface is composed of UV-A (320-400 nm) and UV-B (286-320 nm), the
   biological significance of these wavelengths is disproportionate due to
   the higher energy content of quanta in the UV compared to the visible
   portion of the spectrum (Moseley, 1988). Exposure of shallow-water
   benthic organisms to high fluxes of solar irradiance requires a
   trade-off between maintaining high rates of photosynthesis while
   preventing damage from UV radiation. Biochemical defenses against the
   effects of UV may include the presence of mycosporine-like amino acids
   (MAAs) (Dunlap and Shick, 1998 and refs therein). These compounds have
   been found in a variety of marine organisms spanning from cyanobacteria
   (Shibata, 1959) to teleosts (Dunlap et al., 1989) and from tropical
   (Dunlap et al., 1986) to Antarctic waters (Karentz et al., 1991). Some
   tropical and temperate open ocean waters have low attenuation
   coefficients of UV and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700
   nm) due to the low levels of particulates and humic substances which
   absorb or scatter these wavelengths (Kirk, 1994). In other waters, such
   as around mangroves and estuaries, dissolved organic matter or gilvin
   and particulates decrease the transparency of the water column resulting
   in reduced penetration of PAR and even greater reduction of UV with
   increasing depth (Kirk, 1994).
   The purpose of this study was to survey for the presence of MAAs in
   macrophytes and invertebrates from habitats differing in water quality
   to determine the relationship between the concentration of these
   compounds and incident UV radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the main substrate and energy source
   for heterotrophic bacterioplankton. To understand the interactions
   between DOM and the bacterial community (BC), it is important to
   identify the key factors on both sides in detail, chemically distinct
   moieties in DOM and the various bacterial taxa. Next-generation
   sequencing facilitates the classification of millions of reads of
   environmental DNA and RNA amplicons and ultrahigh-resolution mass
   spectrometry yields up to 10 000 DOM molecular formulae in a marine
   water sample. Linking this detailed biological and chemical information
   is a crucial first step toward a mechanistic understanding of the role
   of microorganisms in the marine carbon cycle. In this study, we
   interpreted the complex microbiological and molecular information via a
   novel combination of multivariate statistics. We were able to reveal
   distinct relationships between the key factors of organic matter cycling
   along a latitudinal transect across the North Sea. Total BC and DOM
   composition were mainly driven by mixing of distinct water masses and
   presumably retain their respective terrigenous imprint on similar
   timescales on their way through the North Sea. The active microbial
   community, however, was rather influenced by local events and correlated
   with specific DOM molecular formulae indicative of compounds that are
   easily degradable. These trends were most pronounced on the highest
   resolved level, that is, operationally defined `species', reflecting the
   functional diversity of microorganisms at high taxonomic resolution.}},

   Archipelago dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC, DOC), total

   identify and assess physical, biological, and chemical processes
   responsible for the seasonal variability of DIC, DOC, TA, and pCO(2).
   Surface waters were undersaturated with respect to atmospheric CO2
   throughout the year and constituted a net sink of 1.2 mol C m(-2)
   yr(-1), with ice coverage and ice formation limiting the CO2 uptake
   during winter. CO2 uptake was largely driven by under ice and open-water
   biological activity, with high subsequent export of organic matter to
   the deeper water column. Annual net community production (NCP) was 2.1
   mol C m(-2) yr(-1). Approximately one-half of the overall NCP during the
   productive season (4.1 mol C m(-2) from Apr through Aug) was generated
   by under-ice algae and amounted to 1.9 mol C m(-2) over this period. The
   surface layer was autotrophic, while the overall heterotrophy of the

Abstract = {{Subterranean estuary occupies the transition zone between hypoxic fresh
   groundwater and oxic seawater, and between terrestrial and marine
   sediment deposits. Consequently, we hypothesize, in a subterranean
   estuary, biogeochemical reactions of Fe respond to submarine groundwater
   discharge (SGD) and sea level rise. Porewater and sediment samples were
   collected across a 30-m wide freshwater discharge zone of the Indian
   River Lagoon (Florida, USA) subterranean estuary, and at a site 250 m
   offshore. Porewater Fe concentrations range from 0.5 p.M at the
   shoreline and 250 m offshore to about 286 AM at the freshwater saltwater
   boundary. Sediment sulfur and porewater sulfide maxima occur in
   near-surface 0C-rich black sediments of marine origin, and dissolved Fe
   maxima occur in underlying OC-poor orange sediments of terrestrial
   origin. Freshwater SGD flow rates decrease offshore from around 1 to 0.1
   cm/day, while bioirrigation exchange deepens with distance from about 10
   cm at the shoreline to about 40 cm at the freshwater saltwater boundary.
   DOC concentrations increase from around 75 uM at the shoreline to as
   much as 700 p.M at the freshwater saltwater boundary as a result of
   labile marine carbon inputs from marine SGD. This labile DOC reduces
   Fe-oxides, which in conjunction with slow discharge of SGD at the
   boundary, allows dissolved Fe to accumulate. Upward advection of fresh
   SGD carries dissolved Fe from the Fe-oxide reduction zone to the sulfate
   reduction zone, where dissolved Fe precipitates as Fe-sulfides.
   Saturation models of Fe-sulfides indicate some fractions of these
   Fe-sulfides get dissolved near the sediment water interface, where
   bioirrigation exchanges oxic surface water. The estimated dissolved Fe
   flux is approximately 0.84 uM Fe/day per meter of shoreline to lagoon
   surface waters. Accelerated sea level rise predictions are thus likely
   to increase the Fe flux to surface waters and local primary
   productivity, particularly along coastlines where groundwater discharges
   through sediments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Fluorescence measured in situ as a proxy of CDOM absorption and DOC
   concentration in the Baltic Sea}},
Journal = {{OCEANOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{431-471}},
Abstract = {{This study presents results from held surveys performed in 2008 and 2009
   in the southern Baltic in different seasons. The main goal of these
   measurements was to identify the empirical relationships between DOM
   optical properties and DOC. CDOM absorption and fluorescence and DOC
   concentrations were measured during thirteen research cruises. The
   values of the CDOM absorption coefficient at 370 urn a(CDOM) (370)
   ranged from 0.70 m(-1) to 7.94 m(-1), and CDOM fluorescence intensities
   (ex./em. 370/460) I-Fl, expressed in quinine sulphate equivalent units,
   ranged from 3.88 to 122.97 (in filtered samples). Dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged from 266.7 to 831.7 mu M C. There was
   a statistically significant linear relationship between the fluorescence
   intensity measured in the filtered samples and the CDOM absorption
   coefficient a(CDOM) (370), R-2 = 0.87. There was much more scatter in
   the relationship between the fluorescence intensity measured in situ
   (i.e. in unprocessed water samples) and the CDOM absorption coefficient
   a(CDOM) (370), resulting in a slight deterioration in the coefficient of
   determination R-2 = 0.85. This indicated that the presence of particles
   could impact fluorometer output during in situ deployment. A calibration
   experiment was set up to quantify particle impact on the instrument
   output in raw marine water samples relative to readings from filtered
   samples. The bias calculated for the absolute percentage difference
   between fluorescence intensities measured in raw and filtered water was
   low (-2.05\%), but the effect of particle presence expressed as the
   value of the RAISE was significant and was as high as 35\%. Both DOM
   fluorescence intensity (in raw water and filtered samples) and the CDOM
   absorption coefficient a(CDOM) (370) are highly correlated with DOG
   concentration. The relationship between DOG and the CDOM absorption
   coefficient a(CDOM) (370) was better (R-2 = 0.76) than the relationship
   between DOG and the respective fluorescence intensities measured in
   filtered and raw water (R-2 = 0.61 and R-2 = 0.56). The seasonal cycle
   had an impact on the relationship between DOG and CDOM optical
   properties. The hyperbolic relationships between a(CDOM) (370) vs.
   carbon-specific absorption coefficient a{*}(CDOM) (370), and I-Fl vs.
   the ratio of fluorescence intensity to organic carbon concentration
   I-Fl/DOC were very good. The discharge and mixing of riverine waters is
   a primary driver of variability in DOG and CDOM optical properties in
   the surface waters of the southern Baltic Sea, since all the parameters
   considered are negatively correlated with salinity. It was found that
   there was a positive trend of increasing values of DOM optical
   parameters with salinity increase (within a range of 8-12) in deep water
   below the permanent pycnocline. Evidence is also presented to show that
   late-summer photodegradation was responsible for the depletion of CDOM
   florescence intensities in the mixed layer above the seasonal
   thermocline. It was further demonstrated that the DOG concentration
   increases in the stagnant waters of the Baltic Sea deeps. The Integrated
   Optical-Hydrological Probe, which registers high-resolution vertical
   profiles of salinity, temperature, CDOM and the optical properties of
   water, confirmed that DOM optical proxies can be used in studies of DOM
   biogeochemical cycles in the Baltic Sea.}},

Abstract = {{Globally significant quantities of organic carbon are stored in northern
   permafrost soils, but little is known about how this carbon is processed
   by microbial communities once it enters rivers and is transported to the
   coastal Arctic Ocean. As part of the Arctic River-Delta Experiment
   (ARDEX), we measured environmental and microbiological variables along a
   300 km transect in the Mackenzie River and coastal Beaufort Sea, in
   July-August 2004. Surface bacterial concentrations averaged 6.7 x 10(5)
   cells mL(-1) with no significant differences between sampling zones.
   Picocyanobacteria were abundant in the river, and mostly observed as
   cell colonies. Their concentrations in the surface waters decreased
   across the salinity gradient, dropping from 51,000 (river) to 30 (sea)
   cells mL(-1). There were accompanying shifts in protist community
   structure, from diatoms, cryptophytes, heterotrophic protists and
   chrysophytes in the river, to dinoflagellates, prymnesiophytes,
   chrysophytes, prasinophytes, diatoms and heterotrophic protists in the
   Beaufort Sea.
   Size-fractionated bacterial production, as measured by H-3-leucine
   uptake, varied from 76 to 416 ng C L-1 h(-1). The contribution of
   particle-attached bacteria (>3 mu m fraction) to total bacterial
   production decreased from >90\% at the Mackenzie River stations to <20\%
   at an offshore marine site, and the relative importance of this
   particle-based fraction was inversely correlated with salinity and
   positively correlated with particulate organic carbon concentrations.
   Glucose enrichment experiments indicated that bacterial metabolism was
   carbon limited in the Mackenzie River but not in the coastal ocean.
   Prior exposure of water samples to full sunlight increased the
   biolability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Mackenzie River but
   decreased it in the Beaufort Sea.
   Estimated depth-integrated bacterial respiration rates in the Mackenzie
   River were higher than depth-integrated primary production rates, while
   at the marine stations bacterial respiration rates were near or below
   the integrated primary production rates. Consistent with these results,
   P-CO2 measurements showed surface water supersaturation in the river
   (mean of 146\% of air equilibrium values) and subsaturation or
   near-saturation in the coastal sea. These results show a well-developed
   microbial food web in the Mackenzie River system that will likely
   convert tundra carbon to atmospheric CO2 at increasing rates as the
   arctic climate continues to warm. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{1. We estimated uptake of stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   through a whole-stream addition of a C-13-DOC tracer coupled with
   laboratory measurements of bioavailability of the tracer and stream
   water DOC.
   2. The tracer, a leachate of C-13-labelled tree tissues, was added to
   the head waters of White Clay Creek, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., over a 2-h
   period and followed 1.27 km downstream to generate mass transfer
   coefficients for DOC lability classes within the tracer.
   3. From the longitudinal C-13 uptake curve, we resolved labile and
   semi-labile DOC classes within the C-13-DOC tracer comprising 82\% and
   18\% of the tracer respectively.
   4. Plug-flow laboratory bioreactors colonized and maintained with stream
   water were used to determine the concentration of stream water DOC
   fractions that had a similar lability to the labile and semi-labile
   classes within the tracer and we assumed that stream water DOC and
   tracer DOC with comparable lability fractions in the bioreactors behaved
   similarly in the stream, i.e. they had the same mass transfer
   coefficients.
   5. A small fraction (8.6\%) of the stream water DOC was labile,
   travelling 238 m downstream before being taken up. The remaining
   bioavailable stream water DOC was semi-labile and transported 4.5 km
   downstream before being taken up. These uptake lengths suggest that the
   labile DOC is an energy source within a stream reach, while the
   semi-labile DOC is exported out of the reach to larger rivers and the
   downstream estuary, where it may provide energy for marine microbial
   communities or simply be exported to the oceans.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{A description of an improved dynamic simulation model of a marine
   enclosure is given. New features in the model are the inclusion of
   picoalgae and mixotrophs; the ability of bacteria to take up dissolved
   inorganic nutrients directly; and, for the phytoplankton functional
   groups, the inclusion of luxury uptake and the decoupling of the
   nutrient uptake dynamics from carbon-assimilation dynamics. This last
   feature implies dynamically variable phosphorus/carbon and
   nitrogen/carbon ratios. The model was calibrated with experimental
   results from enclosure experiments carried out in Knebel Vig, a shallow
   microtidal land-locked fjord in Denmark, and verified with results from
   enclosure experiments in Hylsfjord, a deep and salinity-stratified
   Norwegian fjord. Both observations and model simulations showed
   dominance of a microbial food web in control enclosures with low
   productivity. In Nand P-enriched enclosures a classical food web
   developed, while an intermediate system was found in N-, P-and
   Si-enriched enclosures. Mixotrophic flagellates were most important in
   the nutrient-limited control enclosures where they accounted for 49\% of
   the pigmented biomass and about 48\% of the primary production. Lumping
   the mixotrophs in the simulation model with either the autotrophic or
   the heterotrophic functional groups reduced total primary production by
   74\%. Model-derived, time-averaged phosphorus budgets suggested that
   bacteria competed with algae for orthophosphate in the control
   enclosure, but not in the enclosure to which N and P had been added,
   where bacteria functioned as net mineralisers of phosphate. In the N, P
   and Si enclosure, bacteria took up only 10\% of the amount of
   orthophosphate taken up by the primary producers, passing most of the
   organic phosphorus on to their grazers, the heterotrophic
   nanoflagellates, and mineralising only a small fraction directly.
   Inclusion of luxury nutrient uptake affected the simulation of the
   nutrient-enriched enclosures, while the decoupling of carbon and
   nutrient dynamics affected the simulation of the control enclosure.
   Without these 2 processes it was not possible to simulate the carbon and
   nutrient dynamics in the different enclosures adequately with the same
   parameterisation.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of macrofauna in decomposing organic matter was
   studied in microcosms by adding C-14-labeled microalgae to undisturbed
   sediment cores with and without fauna. The Presence of benthic
   macrofauna stimulated release of (CO2)-C-14 only briefly during the
   initial phase (4 d); after 21 d the total amount of (CO2)-C-14, released
   was nearly equivalent with or without fauna. The first-order decay rate
   constant of the added organic matter based on the rate of (CO2)-C-14,
   production was 0.019 d-1 with fauna and 0.020 without. The release of
   {[}C-14]DOC from the sediment accounted for 4-5\% of the total C-14
   release. Only a small fraction of the C-14 added as algae was found as
   (CO2)-C-14, (max, 1.2\%) or  {[}C-14]DOC (max, 0.7\%) in the pore water
   at any time during the experiment. In contrast, there was a significant
   increase of both sediment TCO2 (total inorganic C) production (70\%) and
   O2 uptake (17\%) rates in the presence of animals. The discrepancy
   between the effect of macrofauna on fluxes of labeled vs. unlabeled
   compounds indicates that the surface deposit feeders primarily affected
   decomposition of old and relatively refractory sediment organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{Once in the ocean, plastics are rapidly colonized by complex microbial
   communities. Factors affecting the development and composition of these
   communities are still poorly understood. Additionally, whether there are
   plastic-type specific communities developing on different plastics
   remains enigmatic. We determined the development and succession of
   bacterial communities on different plastics under ambient and dim light
   conditions in the coastal Northern Adriatic over the course of two
   months using scanning electron microscopy and 16S rRNA gene analyses.
   Plastics used were low-and high-density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE,
   respectively), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride with two
   typical additives (PVC DEHP and PVC DINP). The bacterial communities
   developing on the plastics clustered in two groups; one group was found
   on PVC and the other group on all the other plastics and on glass, which
   was used as an inert control. Specific bacterial taxa were found on
   specific surfaces in essentially all stages of biofilm development and
   in both ambient and dim light conditions. Differences in bacterial
   community composition between the different plastics and light exposures
   were stronger after an incubation period of one week than at the later
   stages of the incubation. Under both ambient and dim light conditions,
   one part of the bacterial community was common on all plastic types,
   especially in later stages of the biofilm development, with families
   such as Flavobacteriaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Planctomycetaceae and
   Phyllobacteriaceae presenting relatively high relative abundances on all
   surfaces. Another part of the bacterial community was plastic-type
   specific. The plastic- type specific fraction was variable among the
   different plastic types and was more abundant after one week of
   incubation than at later stages of the succession.}},

Abstract = {{We report measurements of oceanic black carbon (BC) to determine the

   Ocean. We find that the average C-14 age of BC is older (by 62002200
   C-14 years) than that of the concurrently deposited non-BC sedimentary
   organic carbon. We investigate sources of aged BC to sediments by
   measuring a sample of sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) and find
   that POC may provide the main transport mechanism of BC to sediments. We
   suggest that aged BC is incorporated into POC from a combination of
   resuspended sediments and sorption of ancient dissolved organic carbon
   BC onto POC. Our BC flux estimate represents similar to 8-16\% of the
   global burial flux of organic carbon to abyssal sediments and
   constitutes a minimum long-term removal estimate of 6-32\% of
   biomass-derived BC using the present day emission flux.}},

Abstract = {{At the interface between continent and ocean, estuaries receive
   particles, and especially particulate organic matter (POM) originating
   from these two reservoirs, but also produce POM, through autochthonous
   primary production. The origin and composition of surface POM in the
   Gironde Estuary (SW France) and the environmental forcing of its
   variability was investigated using the data set produced by the French
   Coastal Monitoring Network SOMLIT (Service d'Observation en Milieu
   LITtoral; monthly like sampling during years 2007-2009). This estuary is
   considered as a model of macrotidal turbid estuaries. Using elemental
   and isotopic composition of the POM, we estimated that, at the inner
   estuary space scale and inter-annual time scale, surface particulate
   organic carbon (POC) was composed of terrestrial POM originated from the
   turbidity maximum (96.4\%; refractory POC) and flood events (1.6\%;
   labile and refractory POC), and of riverine (0.1\%), estuarine (0.8\%)
   and marine (1.1\%) phytoplankton, i.e. that POC was 98\% and 2\% of
   terrestrial and phytoplankton origin, respectively. However, there was a
   clear spatial gradient: the phytoplankton contribution increases from
   ca. 1\% in the upper and middle estuary to 8.5\% in the lower estuary,
   where light condition is more favourable to plankton growth. The low
   contribution of phytoplankton to the POC is a characteristic of the
   Gironde estuary and contrast with other large temperate estuaries.
   Statistical analysis indicates that salinity, river flow and SPM
   concentration, and thus associated hydro-dynamic and sedimentary
   processes, were the only environmental forcings to the composition of
   surface POC in this system, at intra- and inter-annual time scale. In
   contrast, temperature and nutrient concentrations, and thus associated
   processes, do not force this composition of POC.
   By combining POC fluxes entering the inner estuary (literature data),
   POC loss as dissolved organic carbon and CO2 and as sediment trapping
   within the inner estuary (literature data), and our estimate of the
   composition of POC flux at the mouth of the estuary (96\% and 4\% of
   terrestrial and phytoplankton origin), a first-order net export of POC
   originating from the Gironde to the continental shelf was estimated: it
   amounts 48,150 tC yr(-1), and is composed of 46,200 tC yr(-1) of
   terrestrial material and of 1950 tC yr(-1) of estuarine phytoplankton.
   POC exported by the Gironde Estuary is thus poorly bioavailable for
   shelf pelagic and benthic food webs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Chromophoric dissolved organic matter ( CDOM), the optically active
   fraction of dissolved organic matter, is primarily generated by pelagic
   organisms in the open ocean. In this study, we experimentally determined
   the quantity and spectral quality of CDOM generated by bacterioplankton
   using two different substrates ( with and without photoproducts) and by
   Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and evaluated their potential
   contributions to CDOM dynamics in the peninsular region of the Southern
   Ocean. CDOM was generated by bacteria in all experiments, and the
   presence of photoproducts influenced both the quantity and the spectral
   quality of the resultant CDOM. We confirmed a direct link between
   bacterial production and CDOM generation, which yielded in situ CDOM
   duplication times from 31 to 33 d. Antarctic krill as a direct source of
   CDOM was also confirmed experimentally. We estimated that CDOM
   generation by krill would lead to CDOM duplication times from 0.48 to
   0.80 d within krill swarms. Our findings highlight the potential
   significance of bacteria and Antarctic krill swarms in the generation of
   CDOM and underscore the dynamic nature of CDOM in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was surveyed along the 160
   degrees W transect from the equatorial to the subarctic Pacific. CDOM
   characteristics were evaluated through the measurement of fluorescence
   intensity at 320 nm excitation and 420 nm emission and of absorption
   coefficient (a) at 320 nm, both indicative of marine humic-like CDOM. In
   the surface layer (similar to 200 m), different levels but similar
   optical characteristics of CDOM were found among the oceanic regions
   studied. In the mesopelagic (200-1000 m) and abyssal layers (1000
   m-bottom), levels of fluorescence intensities were linearly correlated
   to those of absorption coefficients, with a similar slope between these
   layers. However, the intercept of the linear relationship between the
   two optical parameters was significantly lower for the mesopelagic layer
   than for the abyssal layer. Differences between intercepts were
   consistent with the transport of optically distinct CDOM to the
   mesopelagic layer through the formation of the North Pacific
   intermediate water (NPIW). At wavelengths shorter than 300 nm, the
   absorption coefficients of CDOM in the surface layer systematically
   deviated from the natural logarithmic relationships between absorption
   coefficients and wavelengths in the 320-350 nm range. This class of
   CDOM, estimated using absorption coefficient at 275 nm, was defined as
   surface-specific CDOM and may be derived from biocomponents.
   Surface-specific CDOM was higher in the relatively young mode water than
   in old NPIW, suggesting that this class of CDOM is semi-labile.}},

Abstract = {{The primary method for the prevention of the introduction of
   nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species in the U.S. is ballast water
   exchange (BWE). Our recent work focused on the use of the excitation
   emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy of the colored dissolved organic
   matter (CDOM) to ``fingerprint{''} water as a function of its port of
   origin, and therefore provide a forensic tool for the enforcement of BWE
   regulations. In that work, we utilized N-way partial least squares with
   discriminant analysis (NPLS-DA), which models the data with an emphasis
   on differences among classes (ports of origin). In this work, EEMs of
   samples from three different U.S. ports were analyzed by parallel factor
   analysis (PARAFAC) coupled with soft independent modeling of class
   analogy (SINICA) to provide an effective classification method with a
   low false positive rate. This coupling, which is shown for the first
   time in this work, can be a useful alternative to NPLS-DA in that
   PARAFAC-SIMCA decomposes the EEM signal into chemical components and
   utilizes the scores for these components in the classification scheme.
   This gives the user the option of removing the contributions of
   interfering or unidentifiable fluorescent components prior to
   classification. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the usefulness of fluorescence techniques for
   long-term monitoring and assessment of the dynamics (sources, transport
   and fate) of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in highly
   compartmentalized estuarine regions with non-point water sources. Water
   samples were collected monthly from a total of 73 sampling stations in
   the Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) estuaries during 2001 and 2002.
   Spatial and seasonal variability of CDOM characteristics were
   investigated for geomorphologically distinct sub-regions within Florida
   Bay (1713), the Ten Thousand Islands (TTI), and Whitewater Bay (WWB).
   These variations were observed in both quantity and quality of CDOM. TOC
   concentrations in the FCE estuaries were generally higher during the wet
   season (June-October), reflecting high freshwater loadings from the
   Everglades in TTI, and a high primary productivity of marine biomass in
   FB. Fluorescence parameters suggested that the CDOM in FB is mainly of
   marine/microbial origin, while for TTI and WWB a terrestrial origin from
   Everglades marsh plants and mangroves was evident. Variations in CDOM
   quality seemed mainly controlled by tidal exchange/mixing of Everglades
   freshwater with Florida Shelf waters, tidally controlled releases of
   CDOM from fringe mangroves, primary productivity of marine vegetation in
   FB and diagenetic processes such as photodegradation (particularly for
   WWB). The source and dynamics of CDOM in these subtropical estuaries is
   complex and found to be influenced by many factors including hydrology,
   geomorphology, vegetation cover, landuse and biogeochemical processes.
   Simple, easy to measure, high sample throughput fluorescence parameters
   for surface waters can add valuable information on CDOM dynamics to
   long-term water quality studies which can not be obtained from
   quantitative determinations alone.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Photochemical production rates and steady-state concentrations of the
   highly reactive OH radical were determined in Antarctic seawater in the
   Weddell-Scotia Confluence during the austral spring of 1993 and along
   the Antarctic Peninsula during the austral summer of 1994. OH radical
   photoproduction rates were 30 +/- 2 nM/day and 46 +/- 2 nM/day in
   surface open oceanic and coastal waters, respectively. Corresponding
   steady-state concentrations were 2.6 x 10(-19) and 4.3 x 10(-19) M which
   are similar to those found in tropical latitudes. In-situ irradiation
   experiments (drifter deployments) at different depths in the upper water
   column indicated that multiple sources for the OH radical existed at
   three Antarctic stations. Ultrafiltration studies and model calculations
   based on wavelength-dependent OH radical quantum yields indicated that
   the main sources were photochemical reactions of low molecular weight
   dissolved organic matter (DOM), nitrate, and nitrite. Production of the
   ON radical from nitrate photolysis was almost exclusively UV-B
   dependent, while OH radical production from nitrite photolysis was
   mainly UV-A dependent. OH production from DOM photolysis was both UV-A
   and UV-B dependent. In the upper few meters at open oceanic sites,
   nitrate and DOM were the dominant OH radical sources, while deeper in
   the water column DOM and nitrite were important because of the greater
   importance of UV-A with depth. During non-ozone hole conditions, nitrate
   contributed about 33\%, while DOM plus nitrite contributed about 67\% of
   the predicted OH radical production in open oceanic surface waters.
   During an ozone hole (151 Dobson units), the corresponding percentages
   changed to about 40 and 60\% for nitrate and DOM due to the higher UV-B
   irradiance. Model calculations predict that during an ozone hole (151
   Dobson units), OH radical production in surface waters will be enhanced
   by at least 20\%, mostly from nitrate photolysis and to a lesser extent
   from DOM photochemical reactions. This study indicates that ozone hole
   events significantly increase OH radical production, as well as the
   photolysis of DOM, in Antarctic waters, and that rates can be as high or
   higher than those at lower latitudes, especially if differences in
   temperature and solar irradiance are taken into account. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) are emitted into the atmosphere from the
   ocean's surface. Although the oceanic contribution to the global NMHC
   budget is considered minor relative to other sources, it is one of the
   least well measured or understood. The major compounds emitted are a
   series of C-2-C-4 alkenes. Due to their ubiquitous presence in seawater,
   their high reactivity in the atmosphere, and the important role they
   play in the atmospheric chemistry in remote regions of the globe, the
   processes responsible for their formation and fate warrant examination.
   To ascertain the role of photoprocesses in NMHC formation in surface
   waters, laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the magnitude
   and wavelength dependence of NMHC photoproduction for a range of water
   types. Photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   present in surface seawater results in the production of the C-2-C-4
   alkenes in the surface ocean with the UV portion (295-340 nm) of the
   solar spectrum controlling the bulk of this production. Under summer
   sunlight intensities in Miami, FL, net photoproduction rates for ethene,
   the dominant photoproduced NMHC in surface seawater, varied from 0.220
   pmol l(-1) min(-1) for transparent oligotrophic waters to 6.11 pmol
   l(-1) min(-1) for highly colored estuarine waters. Apparent quantum
   yields of photoproduction varied from 10(-9) to 10(-7) depending on
   water type, wavelength of light and individual compound. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Nitrogen often limits primary production in marine ecosystems and its
   loading from terrestrial sources is the major cause of enhanced coastal
   eutrophication worldwide. About 70\% of nitrogen transported by rivers
   globally is dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), Therefore, terrestrial DON
   is potentially an important component of the N dynamics in aquatic
   ecosystems, but the bioavailability of this organic nitrogen is poorly
   known, Bacterial extracellular hydrolysis of polymers is a bottleneck in
   the utilization of natural dissolved organic matter, mostly consisting
   of high molecular weight compounds. To study the bacterial utilization
   and extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis of DON, we developed a bioassay
   employing natural DON as the only N source, and N as the limiting
   nutrient. Bacterial cell density and activity of an unspecific
   aminopeptidase (AMPase) were followed. in the cultures. Natural DON
   stimulated the cell-specific AMPase activity. Furthermore, refractory
   and humus-rich DOM caused a stronger stimulation than labile DOM. We
   propose that the previously reported inhibitory effect of humic
   substances on enzyme activity was outweighed by the induction of enzyme
   synthesis caused by refractory substrates, AMPase activity and the
   estimated DON bioavailability were more than twofold higher in seawater
   than in freshwater with identical substrate additions. This indicates
   that hydrolysis and turnover of land-derived DON is enhanced when it
   enters coastal marine waters, enabling it to support elevated
   bacterioplankton and phytoplankton growth.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in solar UV radiation could affect terrestrial and aquatic
   biogeochemical cycles thus altering both sources and sinks of greenhouse
   and chemically-important trace gases (e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon
   monoxide (CO), carbonyl sulfide (COS)). In terrestrial ecosystems,
   increased UV-B could modify both the production and decomposition of
   plant matter with concomitant changes in the uptake and release of
   atmospherically-important trace gases. Decomposition processes can be
   accelerated when UV-B photodegrades surface litter, or retarded when the
   dominant effect involves changes in the chemical composition of living
   tissues that reduce the biodegradability of buried litter. These changes
   in decomposition can affect microbia{[} production of carbon dioxide and
   other trace gases, and also may affect the availability of nutrients
   essential for plant growth. Primary production can be reduced by
   enhanced UV-B, but the effect is variable between species and even
   cultivars of some crops. Likewise, the effects of enhanced UV-B on
   photoproduction of CO from plant matter is species dependent and occurs
   more efficiently from dead than living matter. Aquatic ecosystem studies
   in several different locations have shown that reductions in current
   levels of solar UV-B result in enhanced primary production, and
   Antarctic experiments under the ozone hole demonstrated that primary
   production is inhibited by enhanced UV-B. In addition to its effects on
   primary production, solar UV radiation can reduce bacterioplankton
   growth in the upper ocean with potentially important effects on marine
   biogeochemical cycles. Decomposition processes can be retarded when
   bacterial activity is suppressed by enhanced UV-B radiation or
   stimulated when solar UV radiation photodegrades aquatic dissolved
   organic matter (DOM). Photodegradation of DOM results in loss of UV
   absorption and formation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO, and
   organic substrates that are readily mineralized or taken up by aquatic
   microorganisms. The marine sulfur cycle may be affected by UV-B
   radiation resulting in possible changes in the sea-to-air emissions of
   COS and dimethylsulfide (DMS), two gases that are degraded to sulfate
   aerosols in the stratosphere and troposphere, respectively.}},

Title = {{SAR202 Genomes from the Dark Ocean Predict Pathways for the Oxidation of
   Recalcitrant Dissolved Organic Matter}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Deep-ocean regions beyond the reach of sunlight contain an estimated 615
   Pg of dissolved organic matter (DOM), much of which persists for
   thousands of years. It is thought that bacteria oxidize DOM until it is
   too dilute or refractory to support microbial activity. We analyzed five
   single-amplified genomes (SAGs) from the abundant SAR202 clade of
   dark-ocean bacterioplankton and found they encode multiple families of
   paralogous enzymes involved in carbon catabolism, including several
   families of oxidative enzymes that we hypothesize participate in the
   degradation of cyclic alkanes. The five partial genomes encoded 152
   flavin mononucleotide/F420-dependent monooxygenases (FMNOs), many of
   which are predicted to be type II Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs)
   that catalyze oxygen insertion into semilabile alicyclic alkanes. The
   large number of oxidative enzymes, as well as other families of enzymes
   that appear to play complementary roles in catabolic pathways, suggests
   that SAR202 might catalyze final steps in the biological oxidation of
   relatively recalcitrant organic compounds to refractory compounds that
   persist.
   IMPORTANCE Carbon in the ocean is massively sequestered in a complex
   mixture of biologically refractory molecules that accumulate as the
   chemical end member of biological oxidation and diagenetic change.
   However, few details are known about the biochemical machinery of carbon
   sequestration in the deep ocean. Reconstruction of the metabolism of a
   deep-ocean microbial clade, SAR202, led to postulation of new
   biochemical pathways that may be the penultimate stages of DOM oxidation
   to refractory forms that persist. These pathways are tied to a
   proliferation of oxidative enzymes. This research illuminates dark-ocean
   biochemistry that is broadly consequential for reconstructing the global
   carbon cycle.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{At least 15\% of the 2 Pg y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that
   accumulates in the surface layer of the open ocean has been exported
   from the ocean margins. The C:N:P stoichiometry of the production and
   microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the coastal
   ocean conditions the quality of the exported substrates. In this work,
   DOC, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP)
   bioavailability measurements from published bottle incubation
   experiments have been compiled and reanalyzed to examine the role of
   bioavailable DOM (BDOM) in the coastal ocean. DOM bioavailability
   decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in the sequence DOP > DON > DOC,
   with bioavailable DOC (BDOC) representing 22 +/- 12\% (mean +/- SD) of
   the total DOC, bioavailable DON (BDON) 35 +/- 13\% of the total DON and
   bioavailable DOP (BDOP) 70 +/- 18\% of the total DOP. This suggests that
   the role of DOM on the recycled and export production of the coastal
   ocean is more relevant for the P than for the N and for the N than for
   the C biogeochemical cycles. First-order microbial degradation rate
   constants (kappa) of BDOM (normalized to 15 degrees C) increased
   significantly (p < 0.05) in the same sequence, with kappa(C) being 0.066
   +/- 0.065 day(-1), kappa(N) 0.111 +/- 0.096 and kappa(P) 0.154 +/- 0.137
   day(-1). Significant (p < 0.001) power relationships were found among
   kappa(C), kappa(N) and kappa(P) (R-2 = 0.84-0.87). The C: N: P molar
   ratio of the DOM that resists microbial degradation was extremely
   depleted in N and P, 2835 (+/- 3383): 159 (+/- 187): 1, compared with
   the BDOM fraction, 197 (+/- 111): 25 (+/- 16): 1. The flushing time
   (tau) of the coastal ocean in relation to the turnover time of BDOM
   (1/kappa), i.e., tau . kappa, dictates the fate-degradation versus
   accumulation-of the large scale export of BDOM, which could fuel parts
   of the oceanic new production and influence the N/P limitation of the
   open ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Phenols represent a group of organic pollutants frequently found in many
   near-shore marine systems. The microbial degradation of phenols, mainly
   by bacteria and fungi, has been extensively studied both experimentally
   and theoretically, but only relatively recently the capabilities of some
   algae for phenols biodegradation gained interest. The biodegradation of
   phenols by microalgae occurs only under aerobic conditions. In this
   paper, a dynamic energy budget model is proposed for describing aerobic
   biodegradation of phenolic compounds by microalgae and qualitatively
   validated against experimental data. A microalgal cell has the ability
   to produce biomass via the autotrophic assimilation (uptake of light and
   dissolved inorganic carbon), the heterotrophic assimilation (uptake of
   dissolved organic carbon) and, to a lesser extend, via the
   biodegradation of phenols. The rules of synthesizing units are used for
   the uptake and interactions of substrates and for the merging of
   assimilates. The model is capable of making predictions under oxygen and
   carbon (inorganic and organic) limiting conditions. Model predictions
   cover a wide range of experimental evidence, but also give a possible
   explanation for the inhibition of bioremoval of phenols in the presence
   of glucose. The dissolved oxygen profiles numerically observed show low
   oxygen concentration during the intermediate phase of the biodegradation
   process and a rapid increase after the consumption of the phenolic
   compound, indicating that lack of oxygen could be a limiting factor for
   the biodegradation of phenols. The presence of glucose increases the
   specific growth rate but decreases the specific biodegradation rate of
   the phenolic compound. Model analysis suggests that this inhibition may
   be due to the competition for oxygen between glucose and phenol
   assimilation. In general, the balance between the benefits and costs of
   the different types of assimilation determines the microalgal growth
   rates as well as the phenol biodegradation rates. Being based on general
   assumptions, the model can be applied to the biodegradation of a wide
   variety of aromatic compounds. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Photodegradation of estuarine dissolved organic matter: a multi-method
   assessment of DOM transformation}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{A multi method approach was applied to Study changes in dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) at three estuarine sites with varying salinity, as
   well as changes resulting from experimental photodegradation. Following
   measurement of ultraviolet and visible absorption spectra of bulk
   samples, DOM was isolated using C-18 solid phase extraction. The extract
   was characterized using high performance size exclusion chromatography
   (HP-SEC) and molecular level characterization was conducted via direct
   temperature-resolved mass spectrometry (DT-MS) and electrospray
   ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The molecular weight distribution
   of DOM as determined from HP-SEC and ESI-MS varied between techniques,
   but generally decreased down estuary and with photodegradation for both
   approaches. Relative differences in molecular weight were significantly
   correlated with the ratio of absorption coefficients at 2541365 nm.
   Additionally, photobleaching was significantly correlated with mass
   spectral characteristics from both DT-MS and ESI-MS. Principal component
   analysis of DT-MS spectra showed that photo-exposure removed different
   mass spectral characteristics depending on sampling site: however, upon
   photodegradation, the mass spectral characteristics of both marine DOM
   and terrestrially dominated DOM approached a common spectrum, We
   interpret this spectrum, characterized by fragments from aromatic and
   carbohydrate-like precursors, as photochemically refractory DOM. Our
   results show that multiple approaches that characterize different
   aspects of DOM can provide complementary information about its sources
   and transformation. More specifically, photobleaching results in
   decreased light absorbance, decreased molecular weight and shifts in the
   relative abundance of classes of compounds (and broad shifts in m/z
   values); moreover, these transformations result in photodegraded samples
   from a low-salinity site which are compositionally similar to samples
   collected from a mid-salinity site further downstream. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To estimate the depth-integrated rate of photochemical processes
   involving chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in coastal
   waters, the contribution of CDOM to the total absorption coefficient
   must be known from UV to green. At 307 sites sampled in various coastal
   marine environments, the ratio between CDOM and the total absorption
   coefficient ({[}a(CDOM/)a(t)]) at 412 nm was found to vary over a wide
   range, from 0.20 to 0.95. An empirical algorithm was developed to
   retrieve {[}a(CDOM)/a(t)](412) from satellite remote sensing
   reflectance. The absolute uncertainty on the {[}a(CDOM)/a(t)] retrieval
   was 0.14. As exemplified with the data from the Baltic and North Seas,
   the algorithm provides a means to distinguish the contribution of CDOM
   to the absorption coefficient of colored detrital material (i.e., CDM =
   CDOM + nonalgal particles) at the regional scale. The implications of
   the variability in the magnitude and spectral shape of {[}a(CDOM)/a(t)]
   for the assessment of depth-integrated production of any photoproducts
   involving CDOM photolysis are discussed in details. We applied the
   algorithm to a Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) image of
   the Southeastern Beaufort Sea where terrestrial inputs are abundant. The
   spatial variability in the {[}a(CDOM)/a(t)] reaches as much as threefold
   over the continental shelf and beyond. These results clearly show that
   it is necessary to account for the spatial variability of
   {[}a(CDOM)/a(t)] when quantifying CDOM-related photochemical processes
   in the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Sequestration of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by activated carbon
   (AC) has been proposed as a remediation strategy for PCB-contaminated
   sediments. However, published PCB-AC adsorption isotherm data are sparse
   and, while sediment-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) and biofilms
   are likely to be present in sediments, the impacts of these loadings
   have not been quantified. Batch laboratory experiments were undertaken
   to obtain equilibrium adsorption capacities, q(e), for 9 PCBs on virgin
   AC, DOM-loaded AC, and biofilm-covered AC. Isotherm data fit the
   Freundlich isotherm equation (average R-2 = 0.94, n = 27) over the range
   of aqueous concentrations studied (similar to 0.1-1000 ng/L). Planarity
   effects were evident at low aqueous concentrations only (0.1-10 ng/L),
   where qe of three PCBs of similar hydrophobicity decreased with an
   increasing number of ortho-chlorines, indicating steric hindrances
   attenuated adsorption. The values of qe for DOM- and biofilm-loaded ACs
   were approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those on virgin
   AC when normalized by the available AC surface area, indicating that PCB
   adsorption likely occurred on specific regions of the AC structure.
   Nevertheless, virgin and loaded ACs used in this study had sufficiently
   high PCB adsorption capacities to warrant further study as an in-situ
   remediation alternative for PCB-contaminated sediments. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the major reservoirs of active
   organic carbon on Earth. Although the bulk of the marine DOC pool is
   largely composed of small refractory polymeric material, new evidence
   suggests that similar to10\% of the DOC pool (10(16) g C) can enter the
   microbial loop by forming microscopic gels that can eventually be
   colonized and degraded by bacteria. Marine microgels result from a
   spontaneous and reversible assembly/dispersion equilibrium of DOC
   polymers forming hydrated Ca-bonded tangled polymer networks. Here we
   test the hypothesis that ultraviolet (UV) photocleavage should strongly
   inhibit the formation of microgels, because the stability of tangled
   networks decreases exponentially with polymer length. Because of the
   loss of ozone shielding, the UV-B spectral component of solar radiation
   (lambda = 280-320 nm) has undergone a dramatic increase in the past few
   decades, particularly in the polar regions. We used dynamic
   laser-scattering spectroscopy and flow cytometry to investigate
   UV-induced DOC polymer cracking and the effect of UV on DOC
   assembly/dispersion equilibrium in 0.2 mum filtered seawater. Results
   indicate that exposure of seawater to UV-B fluxes equivalent to those
   found in Antarctica during summer solstice can cleave DOC polymers,
   inhibit their spontaneous assembly, and/or disperse assembled microgels.
   Our results agree with previous observations that indicated that
   fragmentation produced by UV photolysis increases exponentially with
   exposure time and suggested that UV could limit the supply of microbial
   substrate by hindering microgel formation. UV cleavage yields
   short-chain polymers that do not assemble and could eventually account
   for the old refractory DOC pool found in seawater.}},

Abstract = {{Natural populations of diatoms were incubated for 4-12 h with
   (HCO3-1)-C-13. The production of particulate and dissolved fractions of
   organic carbon and neutral aldoses (NAld) was followed by gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry. The extracellular production rate of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from 4.1\% to 6.4\% of total
   (particulate and dissolved) production rate. Glucose was a major
   component of the excreted dissolved neutral aldoses (DNAld), and
   galactose, rhamnose, fucose, xylose, and mannose were found as secondary
   components of the excreted DNAld. The comparison of NAld composition
   with cellular products suggests that glucose in the excreted DNAld is
   composed mainly of storage glucan. On the other hand, the high ratios of
   dissolved production to total (dissolved and particulate) production of
   galactose, rhamnose, fucose, xylose, and mannose probably reflect the
   active excretion of heteropolysaccharides by diatoms. By assuming
   steady-state concentrations, turnover rates of DOC and DNAld can be
   estimated from the phytoplankton production of C-13-labeled material.
   The estimated turnover rates of DNAld through phytoplankton
   photosynthesis is 4.2-5.1 times higher than that of total DOC, which
   indicates the bioreactive nature of DNAld. This high turnover rate of
   DNAld mainly resulted from the high turnover rate of glucose, and it is
   likely that dissolved glucan is important as a carbon and energy carrier
   in the marine food web. The fact that the turnover rates of DNAld, which
   is considered to constitute heteropolysaccharides, are lower than that
   of glucose, would suggest that heteropolysaccharides are more resistant
   to biological degradation than glucan.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{The stoichiometric model of Redfield, which describes the elemental
   composition of marine organic matter, is generally used to link the
   production of new organic matter to the uptake of nitrate. The Redfield
   C:N molar ratio of 6.6 is a well-established value for particulate
   organic matter produced in surface waters. Yet recent studies have shown
   that the inorganic C:N uptake ratio during nitrate-limiting conditions
   is >14. This non-Redfield behavior during the production of new organic
   matter suggests that a large standing stock of organic matter, rich in
   carbon, should accumulate in the euphotic zone from the spring bloom to
   late summer. This hypothetical pool of carbon-rich organic matter and
   the pool of transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) exhibit similar
   seasonal distributions, which suggests that TEP may indeed be this
   carbon-rich pool. For this scheme to work, TEP should have a high C:N
   ratio.
   TEP distribution from an open-ocean site in the northwestern
   Mediterranean Sea (DYFAMED) was monitored, and TEP C:N ratio was
   measured from TEP produced in the laboratory by bubbling dissolved
   organic matter collected in the field. We found that the TEP pool
   increases during the summer season and that the C:N ratio of TEP
   produced from naturally occurring dissolved organic matter, is well in
   excess of the Redfield ratio with an overall average C:N molar ratio of
   similar to 20. As a result, the production of TEP could be the main
   pathway of carbon overconsumption required of oligotrophic,
   nitrate-limiting waters, and, thus, TEP may represent an important
   intermediary pool in the ocean carbon cycle.}},

   subtropical Atlantic Ocean}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{13-25}},
Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that in the euphotic zone of oligotrophic
   oceanic waters, the growth-limiting nutrients for bacterioplankton vary
   over a diel cycle due to competition with phytoplankton, leading to
   distinct diel patterns in bacterioplankton. During a cruise across the
   subtropical Atlantic Ocean, a distinct diel periodicity in
   bacterioplankton was detectable, with highest bacterial abundance in the
   early morning and declining over the day. A peak in the frequency of
   dividing cells (FDC, 20 to 25 \% of the total bacterial community) was
   recorded at midnight; FDC rates were consistently low during the day and
   cell volume increased over the day until the early night period. No diel
   variations in these parameters were detectable in the layers below the
   deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). Bio-assay experiments with freshly
   collected, N+P amended water were started in the early morning. No
   significant bacterial growth was detectable in the early morning while,
   in the bio-assays that started at noon, significant bacterial growth was
   detectable in the N+P treatments. P amendment alone also caused an
   increase in bacterial abundance although to a lesser extent. Thus, we
   have evidence that the bacterioplankton in the euphotic layer of the
   subtropical Atlantic are not limited by the availability of N+P in the
   morning (most likely limited in C) but at noon when they are competing
   with phytoplankton for the inorganic N+P sources. Based on the
   concomitantly measured decline in inorganic N+P in the bio-assays, we
   estimated the C:N:P ratio of newly produced bacteria. The mean atomic
   C:N:P ratio for the bacteria in the N+P amended bio-assay experiments
   started in the early morning was C:N:P = 15:13:1 while the corresponding
   ratio for bacteria in the bio-assays started at noon was C:N:P =
   118:11:1. This diel variation in the C:N:P ratio was caused by the 1
   order of magnitude higher bacterial C production at noon as compared to
   the early morning. Thus, excess uptake of N+P occurs during the morning
   and luxury C uptake during noon. This plasticity in the C:N:P ratio of
   bacterioplankton might be a strategy to overcome, at least partly,
   periods of shortage in a specific nutrient species in the oligotrophic
   subtropical Atlantic.}},

Abstract = {{The production mechanism of light alkenes, alkanes, and Isoprene was
   investigated in laboratory experiments by measuring their concentrations
   in natural seawater as a function of spectral range, exposure time and
   origin, and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOG). The
   production mechanism of alkanes and of isoprene could not be clarified.
   Ethene and propene are produced photochemically from DOG. The relevant
   spectral range is UV and short-wavelength visible light. Initial
   production rates (up to day 10 of exposure) were in the range of several
   pmol L-1 h(-1) (mg DOC)(-1); the corresponding mean quantum yields for
   the spectral range of 300-420 nm were about 10(-8). Generally, the
   production rates and the quantum yields for ethene were about 2 times
   that of propene. The key factors in the total column integrated oceanic
   alkene production are the solar photon flux at sea surface, the
   penetration depth of the light into the ocean (especially the relation
   between different light absorbers, i.e., the extinction due to
   absorption of DOG), and the wavelength-and DOG-dependent quantum yields.
   As a result of the high variability of these parameters, actual local
   alkene production rates for a specific oceanic region may differ
   considerably from the globally averaged oceanic alkene production rates.
   The latter were estimated to be at most 5 Mt yr(-1).}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to identify molecular features
   characteristic to arctic DOM from the Kolyma River basin and to
   elucidate structural imprints induced by a choice of the sorption

   basin with a use of three nonionic sorbents: Amberlite XAD-8 resin, PPL-
   and C18 - SPE cartridges, and one anion exchanging
   resin-diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) -cellulose. The structural studies were
   conducted with a use of electrospray ionization Fourier Transform Ion
   Cyclotron Resonance (ESI FT-ICR) mass spectrometry and liquid state H-1
   NMR spectroscopy. The DOM isolates obtained with a use of PPL and C18
   cartridges were characterized with higher content of aliphatic compounds
   as compared to XAD-8 and DEAE-isolates. In total, for all arctic DOM
   isolates we observed predominance of hydrogen saturated compounds with
   high H/C values of identified formulas from FT-ICR MS data. H-1 NMR
   spectroscopy studies have confirmed this trend and revealed high
   contribution of alkyl-chain protons into the spectral density of the
   arctic DOM reaching 43\% for PPL isolates.}},

Abstract = {{Landfill leachate is generally characterized as a complex recalcitrant
   wastewater containing high concentration of dissolved organic matter
   (DOM). A combination of sequencing batch reactor (SBR) + aeration
   corrosive cell-Fenton (ACF) + granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption
   in series was proposed for the purpose of removing pollutants in the
   leachate. Fractionation was also performed to investigate the
   composition changes and characteristics of the leachate DOM in each
   treatment process. Experimental results showed that organic matter, in
   terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 5-day biological oxygen demand
   (BOD5), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), was reduced by 97.2\%,
   99.1\%, and 98.7\%, respectively. To differentiate the DOM portions.
   leachates were separated into five fractions by XAD-8 and XAD-4 resins:
   hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid
   (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N), and hydrophilic fraction (HPI).
   The predominant fraction in the raw leachate was HPO-A (36\% of DOC),
   while the dominant fraction in the final effluent was HPI (53\% of DOC).
   Accordingly, macromolecules were degraded to simpler ones in a
   relatively narrow range below 1000 Da. Spectral and chromatographic
   analyses also showed that most humic-like substances in all fractions
   were effectively removed during the treatments and led to a simultaneous
   decrease in aromaticity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water samples of contrasting origin, including natural seawater, two
   sediment elutriates and sewage-influenced seawater, were collected and
   obtained to examine the effect of the dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   present on metal bioavailability. The carbon content (DOC) and the
   optical properties (absorbance and fluorescence) of the coloured DOM
   fraction (CDOM) of these materials were determined. Cu and Pb
   complexation properties were measured by anodic stripping voltammetry
   (ASV) and the effect of DOM on Cu and Pb bioavailability was studied by
   means of the Paracentrotus lividus embryo-larval bioassay. Sediment
   elutriates and sewage-influenced water (1) were enriched 1.4-1.7 times
   in DOC; (2) absorbed and reemitted more light; and (3) presented higher
   Cu complexation capacities (L-Cu) than the natural seawater used for
   their preparation. L-Cu varied from 0.08 mu M in natural seawater to 0.3
   and 0.5 mu M in sediment elutriates and sewage-influenced water,
   respectively. Differences in DOC, CDOM and Cu complexation capacities
   were reflected in Cu toxicity. DOM enriched samples presented a Cu EC50
   of 0.64 mu M, significantly higher than the Cu EC50 Of natural and
   artificial seawater, which was 0.38 mu M. The protecting effect of DOM
   on Cu toxicity greatly disappeared when the samples were irradiated with
   high intensity UV-light. Cu toxicity could be successfully predicted
   considering ASV-labile Cu concentrations in the samples. Pb complexation
   by DOM was only detected in the DOM-enriched samples and caused little
   effect on Pb EC50. This effect was contrary for both elutriates: one
   elutriate reduced Pb toxicity in comparison with the control artificial
   seawater, while the other increased it. UV irradiation of the samples
   caused a marked increase in Pb toxicity, which correlated with the
   remaining DOC concentration. DOM parameters were related to Cu
   speciation and toxicity: good correlations were found between DOC and Cu
   EC50, while L-Cu correlated better with the fluorescence of marine humic
   substances. The present results stress the importance of characterizing
   not only the amount but also the quality of seawater DOM to better
   predict ecological effects from total metal concentration data. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The research objective was to assess dissolved organic nitrogen (DON)
   bioavailability in wastewater effluents from a pilot-scale nitrification

   bacterial and algal inocula. Nitrogen species, dissolved organic carbon,

   The results showed an increase in algal chlorophyll a concentration,
   with a concurrent increase in algal biomass over time; increased
   bacterial counts and a decrease in DON concentration over time; and
   increased carbon-to-nitrogen ratio at the end of the 14-day bioassay,
   indicating effluent DON bioavailability to algae and bacteria.
   Approximately 18 to 61\% of the initial DON in low-total-nitrogen

Abstract = {{We report that hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) was rapidly
   destroyed by sulfides in the presence of black carbon, forming nitrite
   and formaldehyde, rather than toxic nitrosated reduction products.
   Although traditionally viewed as inactive sorbents, black carbons have
   been noted to participate in the destruction of certain contaminants,
   such as azo dyes, Via quinonoid groups. However, in our experiments
   sulfide modification of quinones did not seem to be involved. Although
   at least 1.2 mM sulfides were needed for the reaction to proceed,
   abiotic natural attenuation of RDX in marine sediments may occur,
   because these concentrations are found in certain marine sediments,
   together with black carbon. In the absence of natural black carbons,
   synthetic black carbons, such as activated carbon, may be added to
   sediments. As compared with other in situ techniques, such as
   bioremediation and zero-valent iron cutoff trenches, which often
   generate nitrosated byproducts, this in situ, abiotic technique may be
   an attractive alternative.}},

Abstract = {{Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are photoheterotrophs
   that, if abundant, may be biogeochemically important in the oceans. We
   used epifluorescence microscopy and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to examine
   the abundance of these bacteria by enumerating cells with
   bacteriochlorophyll a (bChl a) and the light-reaction center gene pufM,
   respectively. In the surface waters of the Delaware estuary, AAP
   bacteria were abundant, comprising up to 34\% of prokaryotes, although
   the percentage varied greatly with location and season. On average, AAP
   bacteria made up 12\% of the community as measured by microscopy and
   17\% by qPCR. In the surface waters of the Chesapeake, AAP bacteria were
   less abundant, averaging 6\% of prokaryotes. AAP bacterial abundance was
   significantly correlated with light attenuation (r = 0.50) and ammonium
   (r = 0.42) and nitrate (r = 0.71) concentrations. Often, bChI
   a-containing bacteria were mostly attached to particles (31 to 94\% of
   total AA.P bacteria), while usually 20\% or less of total prokaryotes
   were associated with particles. Of the cells containing pufM, up to 87\%
   were associated with particles, but the overall average of
   particleattached cells was 15\%. These data suggest that AAP bacteria
   are particularly competitive in these two estuaries, in part due to
   attachment to particles.}},

Abstract = {{Synechococci are important primary producers in the ocean and can also
   utilize some components of the dissolved organic matter (DOM). The
   readily utilizable DOM in seawater is mainly polymeric (e.g., protein,
   polysaccharide) or phosphorylated and requires hydrolysis prior to
   uptake. We examined whether synechococci express ectoenzymes to
   hydrolyze DOM components and considered the possible significance of
   ectohydrolases for Synechococcus ecology and organic matter cycling in
   the sea. Five strains of non-nitrogen-fixing synechococci in axenic
   cultures were tested for enzyme activities with fluorogenic substrates.
   All strains show ectocellular aminopeptidase activity, but other enzymes
   were undetectable. The aminopeptidase level was in the range determined
   for five marine heterotrophic bacterial isolates tested for comparison.
   Aminopeptidase was not secreted into the medium; the majority (74\%;
   tested in WH 7803) was cell surface bound, and a small fraction was
   periplasmic. The periplasmic activity was not released by cold osmotic
   shock of WH 7803. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EDTA, inhibitors of
   serine and metalloproteases, strongly or completely inhibited WH 7803
   aminopeptidase. The enzyme seemed constitutive; per-cell activity did
   not change during incubations in unenriched seawater, bovine serum
   albumin, or nitrate-replete mineral medium. In natural planktonic
   assemblages in the Southern California Bight, aminopeptidase activity
   was correlated with Synechococcus abundance as well as the abundance of
   other bacteria. Ectocellular aminopeptidase may be common in marine
   synechococci and play roles in their nitrogen nutrition, particularly in
   low-nitrate and low-light environments. Since synechococci are much less
   abundant than heterotrophic bacteria in seawater, the impact of
   Synechococcus aminopeptidase on proteolysis in the sea is likely to be
   episodic and restricted to specialized microenvironments.}},

Title = {{Molecular Signatures of Biogeochemical Transformations in Dissolved
   Organic Matter from Ten World Rivers}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Rivers carry large amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the
   oceans thereby connecting terrestrial and marine element cycles.
   Photo-degradation in conjunction with microbial turnover is considered a
   major pathway by which terrigenous DOM is decomposed. To reveal globally
   relevant patterns behind this process, we performed photo-degradation
   experiments and year-long bio-assays on DOM from ten of the largest
   world rivers that collectively account for more than one-third of the
   fresh water discharge to the global ocean. We furthermore tested the
   hypothesis that the terrigenous component in deep-sea DOM may be far
   higher than biomarker studies suggest, because of the selective
   photochemical destruction of characteristic biomolecules from vascular
   plants. DOM was molecularly characterized by a combination of
   non-targeted ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and quantitative
   molecular tracer analyses. We show that the reactivity of DOM is
   globally related to broad catchment properties. Basins that are
   dominated by forest and grassland export more photo-degradable DOM than
   other rivers. Chromophoric compounds are mainly vascular plant-derived
   polyphenols, and partially carry a pyrogenic signature from vegetation
   fires. These forest and grassland dominated rivers lost up to 50\% of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during irradiation, and up to 85\% of DOC
   was lost in total if subsequently bio-incubated for 1 year. Basins
   covered by cropland, on the other hand, export DOM with a higher
   proportion of photo-resistant and bio-available DOM which is enriched in
   nitrogen. In these rivers, 30\% or less of DOC was photodegraded.
   Consistent with previous studies, we found that riverine DOM resembled
   marine DOM in its broad molecular composition after extensive
   degradation, mainly due to almost complete removal of aromatics. More
   detailed molecular fingerprinting analysis (based on the relative
   abundance of >4000 DOM molecular formulas), however, revealed clear
   differences between degraded riverine and deep-sea DOM (molecular
   Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of similar to 50\%). None of our experimental
   treatments enhanced the molecular similarity between the rivers and the
   deep ocean. We conclude that terrigenous DOM retains a specific
   molecular signature during photo-degradation on much longer time scales
   than previously assumed and that substantial, thus far unknown,
   molecular transformations occur prior to downward convection into the
   deep oceanic basins.}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular and intracellular dissolved organic matter (E-DOM and

   cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa were characterized, and
   photoreactivity, bioreactivity, and the effects of phototransformations
   on bioavailability of E-DOM and I-DOM were assessed in laboratory
   experiments. Chromophoric (CDOM) and fluorescent (FDOM) properties were
   analyzed by spectrophotometry, and chemical signatures were obtained by
   ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
   spectrometry (FTICR-MS). E-DOM was more heterogeneous regarding optical
   characteristics as indicated by the presence of multiple CDOM peaks and
   the more even distribution of FDOM components, and had less absolute and
   relative numbers for molecular formulae containing nitrogen (N) than
   I-DOM. E-DOM was more photolabile, with greater photochemical removal of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CDOM and FDOM, and exhibited more
   pronounced photochemical alterations in molecular formulae composition
   than I-DOM. E-DOM was less biolabile, with less biological removal of
   DOC, CDOM, and protein-like fluorescent material, and supported lower
   rates of bacterial productivity than I-DOM. Phototransformations reduced
   the bioavailability of E-DOM and I-DOM, as shown by lower bacterial
   productivity and longer DOC and CDOM half-lives in bioassays with
   photoirradiated DOM in comparison to those with nonirradiated DOM.
   Analyses of CDOM, FDOM, and FTICR-MS revealed that the decrease in
   bioavailability was caused primarily by photolysis of the biolabile DOM,
   indicating competition between photochemical and biological removal of
   cyanobacterial DOM. These results provided insights into mechanistic
   effects of independent and combined photochemical and biological
   degradation on M. aeruginosa-derived DOM.}},

Abstract = {{Although phytoplankton are the major source of marine dissolved organic
   matter (DOM), their blooms are a global problem that can greatly affect
   marine ecological systems, especially free-living bacteria, which are
   the primary DOM degraders. In this study, we analyzed free-living
   bacterial communities from Xiamen sea during an Akashiwo sanguine bloom
   using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The bloom
   was probably stimulated by low salinity and ended after abatement of
   eutrophication pollution. A total of 658,446 sequence reads and 11,807
   OTUs were obtained in both bloom and control samples with
   Alpha-proteobacteria and Gamma-proteobacteria being the predominant
   classes detected. The bloom decreased bacterial diversity, increased
   species evenness, and significantly changed the bacterial community
   structure. Bacterial communities within the bloom were more homogeneous
   than those within the control area. The bacteria stimulated by this
   bloom included the SAR86 and SAR116 clades and the AEGEAN-169 marine
   group, but a few were suppressed. In addition, many bacteria known to be
   associated with phytoplankton were detected only in the bloom samples.
   This study revealed the great influence of an A. sanguinea bloom on
   free-living bacterial communities, and provided new insights into the
   relationship between bacteria and A. sanguinea in marine ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The bioreactivity or susceptibility of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to
   microbial degradation in streams and rivers is of critical importance to
   global change studies, but a comprehensive understanding of DOM
   bioreactivity has been elusive due, in part, to the stunningly diverse
   assemblages of organic molecules within DOM. We approach this problem by
   employing a range of techniques to characterize DOM as it flows through
   biofilm reactors: dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations,
   excitation emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs), and ultrahigh resolution
   mass spectrometry. The EEMs and mass spectral data were analyzed using a
   combination of multivariate statistical approaches. We found that 45\%
   of stream water DOC was biodegraded by microorganisms, including 31-45\%
   of the humic DOC. This bioreactive DOM separated into two different
   groups: (1) H/C centered at 1.5 with O/C 0.1-0.5 or (2) low H/C of
   0.5-1.0 spanning O/C 0.2-0.7 that were positively correlated (Spearman
   ranking) with chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM,
   respectively). DOM that was more recalcitrant and resistant to microbial
   degradation aligned tightly in the center of the van Krevelen space (H/C
   1.0-1.5, O/C 0.25-0.6) and negatively correlated (Spearman ranking) with
   CDOM and FDOM. These findings were supported further by principal
   component analysis and 2-D correlation analysis of the relative
   magnitudes of the mass spectral peaks assigned to molecular formulas.
   This study demonstrates that our approach of processing stream water
   through bioreactors followed by EEMs and FTICR-MS analyses, in
   combination with multivariate statistical analysis, allows for precise,
   robust characterization of compound bioreactivity and associated
   molecular level composition.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal measurements of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence
   characteristics were combined with weekly to bi-weekly measurements of
   carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) (including particulate,
   dissolved organic and inorganic forms) and chlorophyll to determine how
   riverine inputs and autochthonous production influence DOM and nutrient
   dynamics in the Swan-Canning estuary, Western Australia. Estuarine
   concentrations of C, N, and P were influenced by multiple factors,
   including the seasonal riverine flux of DOM, N, and P, the regeneration
   of mainly inorganic N and P from benthic anoxia, and the delivery of DOM
   and nutrients from urban drains. Parallel factor analysis of
   excitation-emission matrices identified eight fluorescence components
   that were used to fingerprint three distinct sources of estuarine DOM:
   (1) riverine DOM derived mainly from vascular plant material, (2)
   autochthonous DOM recently produced within the estuary (indicated by
   tryptophan-like fluorescence), and (3) autochthonous DOM originating
   from within the lower estuary or coastal marine environment enriched in
   marine humic-like and tyrosine-like fluorescence. Overall, fluorescence
   DOM characteristics shifted from humic-like in the upper and mid-estuary
   to protein-like in the lower estuary, which likely reflects the
   increased contribution of autochthonous relative to terrigenous DOM
   closer to the estuary mouth. Our findings show that DOM composition
   varies with season and estuary position as riverine DOM inputs, mainly
   from terrestrial plant material, are supplemented by autochthonous DOM
   contributions associated with discrete inputs of inorganic nutrients.}},

Title = {{An approach to quantify depth-resolved marine photochemical fluxes using
   remote sensing: Application to carbon monoxide (CO) photoproduction}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1363-1377}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a model to calculate depth-resolved marine
   photochemical fluxes from remotely sensed ocean color and modeled solar
   irradiance. The basic approach uses three components: 1)
   below-sea-surface spectral downward scalar irradiance calculated from a
   radiative transfer model (STAR) and corrected for clouds using TOMS UV
   reflectivities; 2) surface-ocean spectral diffuse attenuation
   coefficients and absorption coefficients for chromophoric dissolved
   organic matter retrieved from SeaWiFS ocean color using the SeaUV/SeaUVc
   algorithms: and (3) spectral apparent quantum yield for the
   photochemical reaction considered. The output of the model is a
   photochemical rate profile, Psi(PR)(z), where z represents depth.
   We implemented the model for carbon monoxide (CO) photochemistry using
   an average apparent quantum yield spectrum and generated a monthly
   climatology of depth-resolved CO photoproduction rates in the global
   ocean. The climatology was used to compute global budgets and
   investigate the spatial and seasonal variabilities of CO photoproduction
   in the ocean. The model predicts a global CO photoproduction rate of
   about 41 TgC yr(-1), in good agreement with other recent published
   estimates ranging from 30 to 84 TgC yr(-1). The fate of photochemically
   derived CO and its role in global biogeochemical cycles remains
   uncertain however, with biological consumption and sea-air exchange
   competing for its removal in the surface ocean. Knowledge of the
   vertical distribution of CO photoproduction is critical in the
   quantification of the relative magnitudes of these sink mechanisms. The
   depth-resolution capabilities of this model, together with US Naval
   Research Laboratory climatology for mixed layer depths allowed further
   estimation that >95\% of the total water-column CO photoproduction
   occurs within the mixed layer on a global, yearly basis. Despite this
   compelling figure, the model also suggests significant spatio-temporal
   variability in the vertical distribution of CO photoproduction in the
   subtropical gyres, where up to 40\% of water-column CO can be produced
   below the mixed layer during summertime.
   While the approach can be applied to other photochemical fluxes (e.g.
   DIC formation or DMS removal), accurate quantification of such processes
   with remote sensing will be limited until the mechanisms regulating
   observed oceanic variability in the apparent quantum yields are better
   understood. Minor modification to this model can also make it applicable
   for the determination of the effects of UV and visible solar radiation
   on sensitive biological systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Phytoplankton release a variable fraction (0 to > 80\%) of the
   photosynthetically fixed inorganic carbon as extracellular dissolved
   organic compounds. Despite this wide range and the potential effects on
   carbon fluxes and food p webs, the knowledge on how the environment and
   phytoplankton species involved influence this process is incomplete.
   Notably, there are no estimates for release of dissolved organic carbon
   by Prochlorococcus, a marine cyanobacterium estimated to be the
   numerically dominant oxygenic phototroph in the oceans. Here we report
   extracellular release of dissolved organic compounds from two axenic
   Prochlorococcus strains representing different ecotypes (MED4 and
   MIT9312) cultured under nutrient replete and phosphorus limited
   conditions. Independent assays based on C-14-bicarbonate tracers and
   analyses of particulate and dissolved organic carbon suggest that the
   release of dissolved organic carbon ranged from 9 to 24\% of the total
   assimilated inorganic carbon with slightly lower values for phosphorus
   limited cultures. Between 4 and 20\% of the released organic matter
   consisted of low molecular weight carboxylic acids, compounds known to
   be highly labile substrates for heterotrophic bacteria. In oligotrophic
   oceans where Prochlorococcus is a dominant contributor to primary
   production and input of terrigenous organic matter is negligible, this
   process is likely a significant contributor to the pool of organic
   substrates available for microbial heterotrophs.}},

Abstract = {{Exopolymeric substances (EPS) isolated from a pure culture of the marine
   bacterium Marinobacter sp. and the marine diatom Skeletonema costatum
   (axenic) were partially purified, chemically characterized and used as
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) for the production of macroaggregates.
   The role of organic particles such as transparent exopolymeric particles
   (TEP) and Coomassie stained particles (CSP) in the production of
   macroaggregates was experimentally assessed. Three experimental rolling
   tanks containing sterile medium with: (1) EPS, (2) EPS + live diatom
   cells and (3) EPS + killed bacteria, and three control tanks without any
   added EPS were used for macroaggregate production. Changes in abundance
   and average size of macroaggregates were monitored using image analysis,
   whereas TEP and CSP were enumerated microscopically. In the presence of
   microbial EPS, macroaggregates of a size of 23-35 mm(2) were produced.
   Aggregate size and abundance considerably varied with both time and
   source of EPS. No correlation was observed for macroaggregate size and
   abundance with either TEP or CSP. One-way ANOVA demonstrated significant
   differences in the variance of particle abundance and size in tanks
   having only EPS or EPS in combination with live diatom cells. Our data
   suggest that production of macroaggregates was influenced by polymer
   chemistry and surface properties of colliding particles, whereas TEP and
   CSP concentrations were influenced by molecular weight of EPS and the
   presence of growing cells. Interestingly, macroaggregates were formed in
   the near absence of TEP and CSP, highlighting the role of other unknown
   processes in the transformation of DOM to particulate organic matter

Abstract = {{Spawning Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) historically transported
   massive quantities of marine-derived nutrients (MDN) into nutrient-poor
   streams of the Pacific Northwest. In southeast Alaska, we measured the
   effects of MDN on streamwater chemistry and epilithon standing stock (1)
   through time during two consecutive years in one stream, Fish Creek; (2)
   over space in six salmon streams; and (3) in a controlled mesocosm
   experiment. In Fish Creek during strong salmon runs in 2000 and 2001,
   streamwater concentrations of ammonium (NH,) increased 10-fold and
   soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) increased by 4- to 7-fold in the
   presence of salmon. NH4 and SRP also increased with distance downstream
   in the salmon reach, likely related to a `carcass-loading' effect. In
   contrast, nitrate (NO3) and dissolved organic carbon concentrations
   varied only with discharge. In 2000, epilithon chlorophyll a increased
   by 20-fold during the salmon run, whereas no significant change was
   observed in 2001. Over space, the multistream survey revealed consistent
   increases in NH4+ and SRP, but no pattern in epilithon response to the
   salmon run. In the mesocosm experiment, NW, SRP, and epilithon standing
   stock all increased in the presence of salmon carcasses in artificial
   streams. Overall, salmon clearly increased the concentrations of
   important dissolved nutrients in southeast Alaska streams. Responses in
   epilithon were more variable, however, suggesting that multiple
   environmental factors including light and disturbance likely regulate
   epilithon growth in salmon streams. Nutrient mass transport estimates
   revealed that a substantial amount of MDN (46\%-60\% depending on
   element) is exported directly back to the estuarine environment,
   suggesting that salmon represent a key marine-freshwater coupling in
   nutrient cycling.}},

Abstract = {{A large fraction of the marine bacterioplankton community is unable to
   form colonies on agar surfaces, which so far no experimental evidence
   can explain. Here we describe a previously undescribed growth behavior
   of three non-colony-forming oligotrophic bacterioplankton, including a
   SAR11 cluster representative, the world's most abundant organism. We
   found that these bacteria exhibit a behavior that promotes growth and
   dispersal instead of colony formation. Although these bacteria do not
   form colonies on agar, it was possible to monitor growth on the surface
   of seawater agar slides containing a fluorescent stain,
   4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Agar slides were prepared by
   pouring a solution containing 0.7\% agar and 0.5 mug of DAPI per ml in
   seawater onto glass slides. Prompt dispersal of newly divided cells
   explained the inability to form colonies since immobilized cells (cells
   immersed in agar) formed microcolonies. The behavior observed suggests a
   life strategy intended to optimize access of individual cells to
   substrates. Thus, the inability to form colonies or biofilms appears to
   be part of a K-selected population strategy in which oligotrophic
   bacteria explore dissolved organic matter in seawater as single cells.}},

Abstract = {{Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy was employed
   to study the chemical nature of organic matter readily released into
   solution from sediment particles during episodes of resuspension.
   Surface sediment samples collected from five locations within the Hudson
   River Estuary and the Inner New York Bight were resuspended in their
   respective bottom waters for periods ranging from 30 s to 2 h. In most
   cases, fluorescence characteristics of the sample after resuspension
   differed from those predicted by conservative mixing of bottom and pore
   waters. Examination of excitation-emission matrices revealed that
   resuspension resulted in: (1) more intense humic-like fluorescence
   (Ex/Em 310/420 nm), and (2) greater fluorescence in the longer
   wavelength region of the spectrum (Ex/Em. 330-388/440-480 nm) relative
   to the predicted values. Trends in the positions of excitation-emission
   maxima reported in the literature strongly suggest that fluorophores
   emitting at longer wavelengths are associated with increasingly degraded
   and/or aged organic matter. Thus, the data imply that resuspension of
   estuarine and coastal marine surface sediments releases degraded and/or
   aged, mineral-bound organic matter from the sediment matrix to the
   surrounding bottom waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The impact of benthic macrofauna (Nereis diversicolor) and macrophytes
   (Spartina anglica) on the dynamics of microbial mineralization rates and
   pathways in saltmarsh sediment was studied over 1 growing season.
   Measurements were conducted in 4 saltmarsh mesocosms subjected to a
   natural tidal regime, and inhabited by either flora, fauna or both,or
   kept without the presence of, macroorganisms. Total benthic
   mineralization was measured during spring, summer and fall as sediment
   oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide release under air-exposed as well as
   inundated conditions, while anaerobic mineralization was quantified as
   sulfate reduction. Porewater concentration profiles of total carbon
   dioxide (TCO2), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), SO42-, Cl- and Fe2+,
   were determined monthly. The presence of fauna had minor effects on
   plant growth, while sediment vegetated by S. anglica renders the habitat
   unsuitable for N. diversicolor, possibly due to food limitation. Without
   the presence of macroorganisms, a dense algal mat (Vaucheria sp.)
   developed on the sediment surface. As a result, the sediment was greatly
   reduced with benthic respiration completely dominated by sulfate
   reduction. Grazing by fauna (N. diversicolor) kept the sediment surface
   free of epibenthic microalgae, and irrigation oxidized the top 15 to 20
   cm of the sediment by enhancing porewater exchange with overlying water.
   Porewater TCO2, DOC and Fe 21 only accumulated below 15 to 20 cm depth.
   Sulfate reduction was still the dominating degradation pathway,
   accounting for 50 to 60\% of the total microbial mineralization. The
   presence of flora (S. anglica) enhanced total microbial mineralization
   but lowered the importance of sulfate reduction (22 to 54\%). Porewater
   constituents such as DOC and TCO2 were kept low and relatively evenly
   distributed with depth. The oxidizing capacity of S. anglica was evident
   throughout the sediment column. The presence of both flora and fauna
   produced the largest increase in oxic as well as total microbial
   mineralization rates. In conclusion, the mesocosm approach simulated
   natural salt marsh conditions well, and the results provide good
   evidence for the interactions between flora and fauna as well as their
   impact on sediment geochemistry.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the bioavailability of colloid-bound metals {[}Cd, Cr(III),
   and Zn] to two marine bivalves (mussel Perna viridis and clam Ruditapes
   philippinarum) from subtropical and tropical waters. Natural colloids
   (between 1 nm and 0.2 mum) were isolated by cross-flow ultrafiltration.
   Bivalves were then exposed to radiolabeled colloids, and the uptake of
   colloid-bound metals was compared with the uptake of metals associated
   with the low molecular weight fraction (LMW, <1 kDa). In general, the
   bioavailability of colloid-bound Zn to mussels was significantly
   inhibited as compared to that of the LMW-bound Zn. Its uptake decreased
   with increasing colloidal organic carbon (COC) concentration. There was
   no major difference in Cd bioavailability between the LMW and the
   colloidal treatments, primarily because most of the radiolabeled
   colloidal Cd remained in the truly dissolved phase during the uptake
   period. In contrast, the bioavailability of colloid-bound Cr was
   enhanced in the mussels. In clams, bioavailability of metals was not
   significantly influenced by colloidal binding, although Zn uptake was
   slightly enhanced when it was associated with the LMW fraction. The
   measured dry weight concentration factor (DCF) in bivalve tissue was the
   highest for Zn, followed by Cd and Cr. Furthermore, DCF was higher in
   the mussels (20-340) than in the clams (10-35). Colloid-bound metals
   were mostly accumulated in mussel digestive gland and remaining soft
   tissue (64-87\%), whereas a large fraction (36-73\%) of metals was found
   on the shell of the clams. Coagulation of radioactive tagged colloidal
   organic matter was insignificant (<9\%) for metals in the absence of
   large suspended particles, indicating that coagulation effects on metal
   uptake were minimal under our experimental conditions. Thus, our study
   demonstrated that colloid-bound metals were bioavailable to both the
   mussels and the clams, but the influences of colloidal binding on metal
   uptake varied among metals and between the two bivalves.}},

Abstract = {{Phthalate acid esters (PAEs) which are mainly anthropogenic molecules
   with endocrine disrupting effects in animals and humans, have been
   detected in terrestrial and aquatic environments. However, little is
   known about their distribution in the Mediterranean Sea, mainly because
   of analytical difficulties and the high possibility of ambient sample
   contamination. Here, we report the optimization of an existing protocol
   for the determination of PAEs in seawater and freshwater samples, as
   well as the first estimation of the source and distribution of
   phthalates acid esters (PAEs) in coastal waters from the NW
   Mediterranean Sea. By passing 1 L of sample through glass cartridges
   packed with 200 mg of Oasis HLB and eluted with 6 mL of ethyl acetate
   followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses,
   the recoveries for DMP, DEP, DPP, DiBP, DnBP, BzBP, DEHP and DnOP were
   101, 98, 115, 110, 99, 98, 103 and 95\%, respectively, with acceptable
   blank values (below 0.4-4.0\% of the masses measured in different
   seawater samples). By using this method, we detected PAEs in the
   Marseilles coastal area, offshore (2000 m depth) and in the Rhone River
   with total concentrations ranging from 75.3 ng/L offshore in surface
   water to 1207.1 ng/L a few meters above the bottom of the Marseilles
   Bay. High concentrations were also observed in deep waters offshore
   (310.2 ng/L) as well as in the Rhone River (615.1 ng/L). These results
   suggest that Marseilles urban area, Rhone River and sediment are
   potential sources of PAEs in the areas studied.
   In the Rhone River, DEHP was the most abundant PAE (66.1\%) followed by
   DiBP (20.5\%) and DnBP (6.6\%), whereas a gradual change was observed in
   the plume of the river with increasing salinity. In the Marseilles Bay,
   DiBP was the most abundant PAE at the surface (47.3\% of total PAEs)
   followed by DEHP (22.7\%) and DnBP (19.1\%), whereas DnBP was
   predominant (38.6\%) a few meters above the bottom. By contrast, DEHP
   was the dominant species in the first 50 m (66.9-76.7\%) offshore
   followed by DnBP (10.9-15.2\%), whereas DnBP was the most abundant
   (57.0-72.6\%) followed by DEHP (20.1-33.1\%) in the deepest waters. This
   study suggests that in addition to direct PAEs injection in marine
   waters, different processes regulate PAE distribution in Mediterranean
   Sea including photochemical oxidation reactions, bacterial degradation
   and possible diffusion following release from marine litter near the
   bottom. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal molecular changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated
   from Tai Lake (Taihu) both during (June) and following (November) an
   algal bloom event in 2007 were characterized by nuclear magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron
   resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry. Considerable biosignatures were
   present in summer DOM, yet with a near absence of algal extract
   compounds. Extensive molecular alteration resulting from multistep and
   massively parallel biotic and subordinated abiotic transformations of
   algal biomass to DOM included loss and synthesis of carbohydrates,
   fundamental changes of aromatic compounds and progressive formation of
   carboxyl-rich alicyclic compounds (CRAM). The DOM transformation from
   summer to fall resulted in smaller molecules, increased abundance of
   CHNO continuous molecular series and overall molecular diversity.
   Analysis of MS-derived compositional networks placed summer DOM
   in-between the algal extract and fall DOM. Metabolic pathway annotation
   by means of high-resolution mass analysis provided a wide range of
   pathways associated with secondary metabolites in DOM and more basic
   ones like carbohydrate metabolism characteristic of algal extract
   compounds. Overall, the time-dependent molecular signature of Taihu DOM
   was likely dominated by microbial metabolism rather than abiotic
   chemical transformations. Results from this study indicate that
   high-resolution organic structural spectroscopy resolves meaningful
   structural detail out of complex environmental mixtures and has the
   potential to contribute significantly to future functional biodiversity
   studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   nutrients were added to all mesocosms in order to initiate phytoplankton
   blooms. Primary production rates were measured by in-vitro incubations
   based on C-14-incorporation and oxygen production/consumption. Size
   fractionated particulate primary production was also determined by C-14
   incubation and is discussed in relation to phytoplankton composition.
   Primary production rates increased in response to nutrient addition and
   a net autotrophic phase with C-14-fixation rates up to 4 times higher
   than initial was observed midway through the 24 days experiment before
   net community production (NCP) returned to near-zero and C-14-fixation
   rates dropped below initial values. No clear heterotrophic phase was
   observed during the experiment. Based on the C-14-measurements we found
   higher cumulative primary production at higher pCO(2) towards the end of
   the experiment. CO2 related differences were also found in size
   fractionated primary production. The most noticeable responses to CO2
   treatments with respect to primary production rates occurred in the
   second half of the experiment when phytoplankton growth had become
   nutrient limited, and the phytoplankton community changed from diatom to
   flagellate dominance. This opens for two alternative hypotheses that the
   effects are either associated with mineral nutrient limited growth,
   and/or with a change in phytoplankton species composition. The lack of a
   clear net heterotrophic phase in the last part of the experiment
   supports the idea that a substantial part of production in the upper
   layer was not degraded locally, but either accumulated or exported
   vertically.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present seasonal changes (monthly samples from
   September 2001 to August 2003) in the abundance and composition of
   dissolved and particulate amino acids, at one station in the lower
   Mississippi and Pearl Rivers (LA, MS: USA). Spatial changes over a 4-day
   transmit from river kin 390 to river mouth (Head of Passes, LA) in the
   Mississippi River, and a two-day downstream sampling from Jackson (MS)
   to Stennis Space Center (MS) were also determined. Temporal data in the
   lower Mississippi River showed significantly lower concentrations of
   dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA, 0.8 to 2.2 mu M) and dissolved
   amino acids in high molecular weight fraction (HMW DAA, 0.2-0.4 mu M)
   than in the Pearl River (DCAA, 1.4-4.3 mu M; HMW DAA, 0.4-1.4 mu M).
   Dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) were significantly lower than DCAA in
   both rivers, and displayed minimal seasonal variability. DCAA, HMW DAA,
   and particulate amino acids (PAA) were generally higher during high-flow
   periods, which may have suggested dominance in terrestrial sources.
   Carbon-normalized yield of PAA (\%C-PAA) was generally higher during
   low-flow conditions and positively correlated with chlorophyll-a
   (chl-a), reflective of in situ sources. Downstream variability in the
   lower Mississippi River showed stable DCAA concentrations, a decline in
   PAA (from 1.06 to 0.43 mu M), and a gradual increase in mole percent of
   non-protein amino acids (\%NPAA). This likely reflected bacterial
   degradation of phytoplankton biomass during falling discharge.
   Nitrogen-normalized yield of PAA (\%N-PAA) was inversely correlated with
   PAA (R = -0.7, n = 48), indicative of short-term sedimentation and
   resuspension events. Conversely, downstream decreases in DCAA and
   middle-reach peaks of PAA and \% N-PAA in the Pearl River, likely
   resulted from photochemical degradation of DOM as well as algal
   production during base-flow conditions. The comparisons in abundance and
   composition of DAA and PAA in these different river systems provides
   important information on in situ nitrogen and carbon cycling as related
   to riverine inputs of organic matter to coastal ocean. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Title = {{Biogeochemical speciation of Fe in ocean water}},
Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{181-197}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{The biogeochemical speciation of Fe in seawater has been evaluated using
   the consistent Non-Ideal Competitive Adsorption model (NICA-Donnan
   model). Two types of data sets were used, i.e. Fe-hydroxide solubility
   data and competitive ligand equilibration/cathodic stripping voltammetry
   (CLE/CSV) Fe titration data. The difference in solubility of
   Fe-hydroxide in 0.7 M NaCl and seawater was used to evaluate the
   speciation of inorganic Fe(III) and was used to parameterize the
   NICA-Dorman model for Fe complexation by the marine DOM fraction (<
   0.025 mu m), relying for competitive ions on generic parameters derived
   for fulvic acid. Marine DOM behaves heterogeneously with respect to Fe
   complexation. This is also observed for Cu(II) complexation. For Cu2+,
   the complexation in seawater can be predicted with the NICA-Donnan model
   using a generic parameter set derived for fulvic acids.
   The Fe-binding decreases with increasing pH due to Fe(Ill) hydrolysis
   and decreasing Fe-hydroxide solubility. Mg(II) and Ca(II) ions are good
   competitors, reducing the Fe(III) complexation by a factor of about 4 in
   seawater at pH 8.1. Trace metals like AI(HI) and Cu2+ have almost no
   effect on Fe(III) complexation and vice versa. Interpretation of the
   non-ideality parameters of Fe(III) as stoichiometry coefficients points
   to an interaction of Fe3+ with two ligands in the low pH range and with
   three ligands in high pH range (seawater).
   The Fe complexation by DOM is almost temperature independent in contrast
   to the dissolution of Fe-hydroxide (Delta H-r = -78 kJ/mol). The Fe
   complexation of marine DOM (fraction < 0.2/0.4 mu m) has also been
   evaluated using Fe titration data of seawater measured with CLE/CSV. In
   most cases, the same chemical heterogeneity is observed, but variation
   in Fe binding (mol/kg DOM) exists. The difference is discussed in
   relation to the variation in the molecular size (HMW/LMW) and
   composition (refractory/labile or humic-like/protein-like) of marine
   DOC. Analysis of the Fe binding during blooming of phytoplankton shows
   that in such situations the Fe-complexation can be enhanced by a factor
   3 compared to non-productive seawater at the same free inorganic Fe
   concentration. Interestingly, the characteristics remain similar to that
   of DOM, which might imply that the newly generated organic ligands do
   not react according to a simple single site Langmuir model. If the
   increase in Fe complexation is due to newly generated ligands, these
   ligands have a much higher affinity on a mass basis compared to DOM,
   suggesting compounds like siderophores or products of cell lysis. The
   data can be described with the NICA model, only adjusting the average
   affinity. Analysis of the speciation in the water column of locations in
   different oceans shows that deepwater in the HNLC areas of the southern
   hemisphere is generally undersaturated with respect to Fe-hydroxide. In
   highly productive areas, the dissolved Fe concentration equals about
   0.6-0.7 nM in agreement with the expected Fe-hydroxide solubility at 5
   degrees C and DOC content of about 40 mu M. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The potential for pelagic microbial communities to hydrolyze high
   molecular weight substrates and therefore to initiate remineralization
   of high-molecular-weight dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was assessed at
   8 different stations spanning a range of locations. Six structurally
   diverse polysaccharides were used to investigate activities and
   structural specificities of a related class of microbial extracellular
   enzymes, the polysaccharide hydrolases. Three high-latitude (57 to
   79degreesN) stations showed similar rates and patterns of enzyme
   activity, with only 3 of 6 polysaccharides hydrolyzed. Hydrolysis at the
   other stations (39degreesS to 29degreesN) showed a variety of patterns,
   in which 2 to 5 of the polysaccharides were hydrolyzed. One of the
   polysaccharides, fucoidan, was not hydrolyzed at any station, while only
   laminarin was hydrolyzed at every station. A limited ability of
   microbial communities in some locations to hydrolyze
   high-molecular-weight substrates could help explain the persistence of a
   fraction of DOC in the ocean, Potential hydrolysis rates showed no
   correlation with factors such as environmental temperature or total cell
   numbers. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of community
   16S rDNA indicated that the microbial communities at these locations
   were diverse, consistent with the diversity in patterns of enzyme

   production of DOM during active bacterial growth in batch cultures with
   artificial seawater amended with glucose and inorganic nitrogen and
   phosphorus. During the initial growth of bacterioplankton, the
   fluorescence of bacterial-derived DOM increased steadily indicating
   release of chromophoric DOM. This bacterial-derived DOM was relatively
   rich in N and depleted in P as indicated by the C:N:P ratio of 147:29:
   1. Exposure of this bacterial-derived DOM to artificial solar radiation
   provoked a rapid decline in fluorescence indicating its photoreactivity.
   Re-growth experiments with natural bacterial assemblages inoculated into
   the solar radiation-exposed bacterial-derived DOM indicated that the
   bioavailability remained essentially unaltered, i.e. is refractory to
   bacterial utilization. Our findings indicate that bacterioplankton

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{C9}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] The absorption of ultraviolet and visible radiation by colored or
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) drives much of marine
   photochemistry. It also affects the penetration of ultraviolet radiation
   (UV) into the water column and can confound remote estimates of
   chlorophyll concentration. Measurements of ocean color from satellites
   can be used to predict UV attenuation and CDOM absorption spectra from
   relationships between visible reflectance, UV attenuation, and
   absorption by CDOM. Samples were taken from the Bering Sea and from the
   Mid-Atlantic Bight, and water types ranged from turbid, inshore waters
   to the Gulf Stream. We determined the following relationships between in
   situ visible radiance reflectance, L-u/E-d (lambda) (sr(-1)), and
   diffuse attenuation of UV, K-d(lambda) (m(-1)): K-d(323nm) =
   0.781{[}L-u/E-d(412)/L-u/E-d(555)](-1.07); K-d(338nm) =
   0.604{[}L-u/E-d(412)/L-u/E-d(555)](-1.12); K-d(380 nm) =
   0.302{[}L-u/E-d(412)/L-u/E-d(555)](-1.24). Consistent with published
   observations, these empirical relationships predict that the spectral
   slope coefficient of CDOM absorption increases as diffuse attenuation of
   UV decreases. Excluding samples from turbid bays, the ratio of the CDOM
   absorption coefficient to K-d is 0.90 at 323 nm, 0.86 at 338 nm, and
   0.97 at 380 nm. We applied these relationships to SeaWiFS images of
   normalized water-leaving radiance to calculate the CDOM absorption and
   UV attenuation in the Mid-Atlantic Bight in May, July, and August 1998.
   The images showed a decrease in UV attenuation from May to August of
   approximately 50\%. We also produced images of the areal distribution of
   the spectral slope coefficient of CDOM absorption in the Georgia Bight.
   The spectral slope coefficient increased offshore and changed with
   season.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent study of the shelf region of the East China Sea, Tsunogai et
   al. {[}1999] estimated that a combination of air-sea exchange and
   biological and physical transport processes could transfer carbon from
   the shelf region into the open ocean at a rate of 35 g C m(-2) yr(-1).
   Contrasting with the solubility and biological pumps of the open ocean,
   they described this collective activity as the ``continental shelf
   pump{''} and suggested that if this pump operated throughout the world's
   shelf regions, it could be responsible for ocean uptake of similar to1
   Gt C yr(-1) (approximate to 50\% current ocean uptake of anthropogenic
   CO2). In this work a general circulation model (GCM) is used to explore
   the potential strength of this pump across the world's shelves. Since
   the GCM does not represent the continental shelf regions explicitly, a
   parameterization of the pump has been used. Results of simulations find
   modeled pump activity very variable between shelf regions, with the East
   China Sea shelf behaving very similarly to the global average. Storage
   of pump carbon is particularly high in the Atlantic Ocean and other
   regions where deep water is formed. A considerable reservoir of pump
   carbon becomes trapped under the Arctic ice sheet. Simple extrapolations
   from the results suggest that should shelf regions absorb CO2 at the
   rate of the East China Sea, the pump would account for a net oceanic
   uptake of 0.6 Gt C yr(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Northern circumpolar permafrost soils contain roughly twice the amount
   of carbon stored in the atmosphere today, but the majority of this soil
   organic carbon is perennially frozen. Climate warming in the arctic is
   thawing permafrost soils and mobilizing previously frozen dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) from deeper soil layers to nearby surface waters.
   Previous studies have reported that ancient DOM draining deeper layers
   of permafrost soils was more susceptible to degradation by aquatic
   bacteria compared to modern DOM draining the shallow active layer of
   permafrost soils, and have suggested that DOM chemical composition may
   be an important control for the lability of DOM to bacterial
   degradation. However, the compositional features that distinguish DOM
   drained from different depths in permafrost soils are poorly
   characterized. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize the
   chemical composition of DOM drained from different depths in permafrost
   soils, and relate these compositional differences to its susceptibility
   to biological degradation. DOM was leached from the shallow organic mat
   and the deeper permafrost layer of soils within the Imnavait Creek
   watershed on the North Slope of Alaska. DOM draining both soil layers
   was characterized in triplicate by coupling ultra-high resolution mass
   spectrometry, C-13 solid-state NMR, and optical spectroscopy methods
   with multi-variate statistical analyses. Reproducibility of replicate
   mass spectra was high, and compositional differences resulting from
   interfering species or isolation effects were significantly smaller than
   differences between DOM drained from each soil layer. All analyses
   indicated that DOM leached from the shallower organic mat contained
   higher molecular weight, more oxidized, and more unsaturated aromatic
   species compared to DOM leached from the deeper permafrost layer.
   Bacterial production rates and bacterial efficiencies were significantly
   higher for permafrost compared to organic mat DOM; however, respiration
   rates were similar between DOM sources. Increased release of permafrost
   DOM from arctic soils to surface waters will change the chemical
   composition of DOM and its lability to bacteria, but this study suggests
   that these shifts in DOM composition and lability may not increase the
   carbon dioxide produced by bacterial respiration of permafrost DOM
   exported to arctic surface waters compared to DOM currently draining the
   shallow active layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite representing only a small fraction of the ocean's dissolved
   organic matter pool, dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) have high
   turnover rates and are major nitrogen and carbon sources for
   bacterioplankton. Both phytoplankton and bacterioplankton assimilate and
   release DFAA, but their consumption and production are difficult to
   quantify in nature due to their short residence times (min) as dissolved
   monomers. We segregated DFAA production by phytoplankton and bacterial
   consumption by measuring individual DFAA concentrations in four axenic
   phytoplankton cultures during the exponential growth phase, and also
   after 4 d incubations in the presence of a natural bacterioplankton
   community. The amounts and composition of the DFAA pool varied widely
   among phytoplankton species. The proportion of dissolved organic carbon
   attributed to DFAA varied among cultures. The picoeukaryotic
   prasinophyte, Micromonas pusilla, released higher amounts of DFAA than
   the other species tested (diatoms and dinoflagellate), especially
   alanine, which has been reported as the dominant individual DFAA in some
   oligotrophic environments. Community structure of heterotrophic
   prokaryotes responded to differences in the quality of organic matter
   released among microalgal species, with Roseobacter-related bacteria
   responding strongly to exudate composition. Our results demonstrate the
   specificity of DFAA extracellular release among several algal species
   and their preferential uptake by members of bacterial communities.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemical oxidation of benzoic acid over boron-doped diamond
   electrodes was studied. Experiments were conducted in a flow-through
   electrolytic cell at current intensities ranging from 11 to 24 A, an
   electrolyte concentration of 0.05 M and initial substrate concentrations
   ranging from 16 to 185 mg L-1. Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to
   diode array detector was employed to follow benzoic acid concentration
   profiles, while chemical oxygen demand and dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) analyses were carried out to assess the extent of mineralization.
   In preliminary experiments, the effect of different electrolytes (NaNO3.
   NaCl or Na2SO4) and the initial pH of the solution (10 or 3.8) was
   evaluated. The effects of operating parameters such as applied current
   intensity, electrolysis time and initial benzoic acid concentration on
   the degradation and mineralization efficiency were investigated with the
   application of factorial design methodology and simple linear models
   describing and predicting adequately the removal of the substrate and
   DOC were developed. The initial substrate concentration and the
   treatment time constitute important parameters with regard to the
   efficiency of the process. Benzoic acid conversion proceeds through the
   hydroxylation of the aromatic ring as evidenced by the formation of
   several hydroxylated derivatives identified by LC coupled to mass
   spectroscopy (LC/MS-MS). Of these, monohydroxybenzoic acids appear to be
   quite stable to electrochemical oxidation. Toxicity tests with marine
   bacteria V. fischeri showed that, at the conditions in question,
   degradation by-products are consistently more toxic than the parent
   compound even after deep oxidation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Within the aquatic carbon cycle, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays
   key roles: as a link between terrestrial and aquatic systems, a major
   food source for biota, a player in photochemical reactions and a
   sunscreen/competitor for light for aquatic organisms. The
   molecular-level composition of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) is
   believed to determine the efficacy of DOM in these roles. While much
   detailed compositional information is available on selected DOM isolates
   from both freshwater and marine systems, relatively few studies have
   presented molecular information for multiple sites within the same
   system and few of these have focused upon large lakes. Therefore, we
   present an initial study of surface water DOM characteristics in a
   temperate large lake (Lake Superior, USA) and selected tributaries.
   UV-visible spectroscopy, electrospray mass spectrometry and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses of bulk DOM, along with
   FTIR and direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry analyses of C-18
   extracts, illustrate a shift from higher molecular weight organic matter
   enriched in protein and lignin at the tributary sites toward
   compositionally different material in the open lake. Differences in
   optical characteristics and DOC concentration between tributary and open
   lake sites are consistent with possible photodegradation of tributary
   DOM. Comparison of our FTIR data with those from a previous Chesapeake
   Bay study indicates that DOM in both the freshwater tributaries and the
   open lake contain a wider range of aromatic and carbohydrate components
   than that in the saltwater tributary and bay. This highlights the need
   for further cross system comparisons of natural organic matter
   composition. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence measurements were used to
   characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM) in bulk water samples from a
   fresh to marine transition zone. The region studied was the Shark River
   and Florida Bay in Everglades National Park in Southwestern Florida.
   Samples were taken from the fresh waters at the head of the Shark River,
   the mouth of the river, and in the fresh-water river plume as it mixed
   into the saline waters of Florida Bay. The salinity varied from 0.47 at
   the head of the river to 36.0 for this series of I I samples.
   Steady-state fluorescence intensity decreased with increasing salinity
   from the head of the Shark River into Florida Bay. This is due to
   dilution by mixing, as changes in the fluorescence intensity also
   correlated with changes in the levels of total organic carbon (TOC).
   Fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed on the five most
   concentrated samples (salinity from 0.47 to 30.5). The decay of the
   time-resolved fluorescence could be reasonably fit to a
   multi-exponential function, with three lifetime components on the order
   of 0.5-0.8, 2-3, and 6-9 its. These ranges are in agreement with
   previous literature results for humic acids, fulvic acids, and marine
   CDOM concentrated by ultrafiltration. This is the first study of CDOM
   fluorescence lifetimes in coastal waters in a fresh to marine transition
   zone. Although photochemical and biological transformations of CDOM
   occur in these zones, no statistically significant difference in
   lifetimes was observed with increasing salinity. However, irradiating
   fresh water samples from the head of the Shark River at 280 and 334 nm
   resulted in a significant decrease in the two shorter lifetime
   components (by a factor of similar to 4), but only a slight decrease in
   the longest lifetime component. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Bacterial diversity was examined in six lakes located in the Adirondack
   Mountains of upstate New York. This region receives significant
   anthropogenic atmospheric inputs of strong mineral acids resulting in
   decreases in pH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) in many of the
   lakes. Statistical methods including correlation and cluster analysis
   were used to determine if there were significant associations between
   phylotypes and water chemistry variables. Direct effects of
   acidification, pH and ANC, were not significantly correlated with any of
   the broadest level taxonomic classifications (equivalent to class or
   order), but may be correlated with subgroups within these
   classifications. Indirect influences of acidification were suggested by
   significant correlations of phylotypes with aluminum chemistry. There
   were positive correlations between the relative abundance of the gamma
   subdivision of the Proteobacteria and total aluminum (r(2)= 0.70, p=
   0.04), monomeric aluminum (r(2)= 0.78, p= 0.02) and non-labile aluminum
   (r(2)= 0.92, p= 0.002). The ACK1 clade of the beta-Proteobacteria
   (Adirondack clade 1) was correlated with monomeric aluminum (r(2)= 0.71,
   p=0.03) and non-labile aluminum (r(2)= 0.73, p= 0.03). Significant
   negative correlations were found between the relative abundance of the
   Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides phylum and total aluminum (r(2)= 0.74,
   p= 0.03), and the High G+C subdivision of the Gram Positive phylum with
   total aluminum (r(2)= 0.70, p= 0.04). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   concentrations may also influence bacteria through amelioration of
   aluminum toxicity and as a carbon source. There were significant
   positive correlations between DOC and the relative abundance of the
   gamma (r(2)= 0.66, p= 0.05) and beta (r(2)= 0.78, p= 0.02) subdivisions
   and the ACK1 clade (r(2)= 0.84, p= 0.01). Additional significant
   correlations were also noted between specific phylotypes and certain
   macro- and micro-nutrients. The results of this study indicate that
   water chemistry can have a direct influence on bacterial lake
   assemblages and that in acid stressed lakes aluminum chemistry and DOC
   concentrations may play a particularly important role.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria are key organisms in the processing of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) in aquatic ecosystems. Their growth depends on both organic
   substrates and inorganic nutrients. The importance of allochthonous DOG,
   usually highly colored, as bacterial substrate can be modified by
   photobleaching. In this study, we examined how colored DOC (CDOC)
   photobleaching, and phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) availability, affect
   bacterial growth. Five experiments were conducted, manipulating
   nutrients (P and N) and sunlight exposure. In almost every case,
   nutrient additions had a significant, positive effect on bacterial
   abundance, production, and growth efficiency. Sunlight exposure (CDOC
   photobleaching) had a significant, positive effect on bacterial
   abundance and growth efficiency. We also found a significant, positive
   interaction between these two factors. Thus, bacterial use of CDOC was
   accelerated under sunlight exposure and enhanced P and N concentrations.
   In addition, the accumulation of cells in sunlight treatments was
   dependent on nutrient availability. More photobleached substrate was
   converted into bacterial cells in P- and N-enriched treatments. These
   results suggest nutrient availability may affect the
   biologically-mediated fate (new biomass vs respiration) of CDOC.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was studied in
   water from a humic and a clearwater oligotrophic lake. Indigenous
   bacteria were inoculated into either 0.2 mu m natural filtered lake
   water, or lake water enriched fivefold with colloidal DOM >100 kD but
   below 0.2 mu m. Consumption of DOM was followed from changes in
   concentrations of total dissolved organic carbon (DOG), dissolved
   combined and free carbohydrates and amino acids (DCCHO and DFCHO, and
   DCAA and DFAA, respectively) and by uptake of monosaccharide and amino
   acid radioisotopes. DCCHO and DCAA made up 8\% (humic lake) to 33-44\%
   (clear-water lake) of the natural DOC pools, while DFCHO and DFAA
   contributed at most 1.7\% to the DOC pools. Addition of >100 kD DOM
   increased the DOC concentrations by 50\% (clearwater lake) to 92\%
   (humic lake), but it only resulted in a higher bacterial production (by
   63\%) in the humic lake. During the incubations 13 to 37\% of the DOC
   was assimilated by the bacteria, at estimated growth efficiencies of
   4-8\%. Despite the measured reduction of DOG, statistically significant
   changes of specific organic compounds, especially of DCCHO and DCAA,
   generally did not occur. Probably the presence of high molecular weight
   DOC interfered with the applied analytical procedures. Addition of
   radiotracers indicated, however, that DFAA sustained 17-58\% and
   29-100\% of the bacterial carbon and nitrogen requirements,
   respectively, and that glucose met 1-3\% of the bacterial carbon
   requirements. Thus, our experiments indicate that radiotracers, rather
   than measurements of concentration changes, should be used in studies of
   bacterial utilization of DOC in freshwaters with a high content of humic
   or high molecular weight organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{Microplastics (MPs) have been regarded as a vector for contaminants and
   greatly affect the migration and fate of hydrophobic organic compounds
   (HOCs) in marine water. In this study, the sorption behavior of 17
   beta-estradiol (E2) on MPs was investigated in marine water system. The
   sorption capacity of E2 varied greatly with the chemical structures of
   MPs. The adsorption or partition contribution of E2 sorption on MPs was
   well quantified with adsorption-partition dual-mode model mechanism. The
   hydrophobic partition dominantly regulates the sorption of E2 due to the
   high crystallinity of MPs and high accessibility of amorphous domain of
   rubbery MPs. Smaller particle size benefits the sorption of E2 on same
   kind of MPs. The salinity and dissolved organic matter (DOM) have minor
   effect on E2 sorption by MPs in real marine water. The result shows that
   the MPs greatly influence the transportation of E2 and cause potential
   environmental risk to marine ecosystem. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Summertime Arctic shipboard observations of oxygenated volatile organic
   compounds (OVOCs) such as organic acids, key precursors of climatically
   active secondary organic aerosol (SOA), are consistent with a novel
   source of OVOCs to the marine boundary layer via chemistry at the sea
   surface microlayer. Although this source has been studied in a
   laboratory setting, organic acid emissions from the sea surface
   microlayer have not previously been observed in ambient marine
   environments. Correlations between measurements of OVOCs, including high
   levels of formic acid, in the atmosphere (measured by an online
   high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer) and dissolved organic
   matter in the ocean point to a marine source for the measured OVOCs.
   That this source is photomediated is indicated by correlations between
   the diurnal cycles of the OVOC measurements and solar radiation. In
   contrast, the OVOCs do not correlate with levels of isoprene,
   monoterpenes, or dimethyl sulfide. Results from box model calculations
   are consistent with heterogeneous chemistry as the source of the
   measured OVOCs. As sea ice retreats and dissolved organic carbon inputs
   to the Arctic increase, the impact of this source on the summer Arctic
   atmosphere is likely to increase. Globally, this source should be
   assessed in other marine environments to quantify its impact on OVOC and
   SOA burdens in the atmosphere, and ultimately on climate.}},

Abstract = {{The forms of inorganic mercury (Hg-II) taken up and methylated by
   bacteria in sediments still remain largely unknown. From pure cultures
   studies, it has been suggested that dissolved organic matter (DOM) may
   facilitate the uptake either by acting as a shuttle molecule,
   transporting the Hg-II atom to divalent metal transporters, or by
   binding Hg-II and then being transported into the cell as a carbon
   source. Enhanced availability of Hg complexed to DOM has however not yet
   been demonstrated in natural systems. Here, we show that Hg-II complexed
   with DOM of marine origin was up to 2.7 times more available for
   methylation in sediments than Hg-II added as a dissolved inorganic
   complex (Hg-II (aq)). We argue that the DOM used to complex Hg-II
   directly facilitated the bacterial uptake of Hg-II whereas the inorganic
   dissolved Hg-II complex adsorbed to the sediment matrix before forming
   bioavailable dissolved Hg-II complexes. We further demonstrate that
   differences in net methylation in sediments with high and low organic
   carbon content may be explained by differences in the availability of
   carbon to stimulate the activity of Hg methylating bacteria rather than,
   as previously proposed, be due to differences in Hg-II binding
   capacities between sediments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Molecular characterization of dissolved organic matter from subtropical
   wetlands: a comparative study through the analysis of optical
   properties, NMR and FTICR/MS}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands provide quintessential ecosystem services such as maintenance
   of water quality, water supply and biodiversity, among others; however,
   wetlands are also among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide.
   Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an abundant and critical
   component in wetland biogeochemistry. This study describes the first
   detailed, comparative, molecular characterization of DOM in subtropical,
   pulsed, wetlands, namely the Everglades (USA), the Pantanal (Brazil) and
   the Okavango Delta (Botswana), using optical properties, high-field
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultrahigh-resolution mass
   spectrometry (FT-ICRMS), and compares compositional features to
   variations in organic matter sources and flooding characteristics (i.e.,
   differences in hydroperiod). While optical properties showed a high
   degree of variability within and between the three wetlands, analogies
   in DOM fluorescence properties were such that an established excitation
   emission matrix fluorescence parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC)
   model for the Everglades was perfectly applicable to the other two
   wetlands. Area-normalized H-1 NMR spectra of selected samples revealed
   clear distinctions of samples while a pronounced congruence within the
   three pairs of wetland DOM readily suggested the presence of an
   individual wetland-specific molecular signature. Within sample pairs
   (long-vs. short-hydroperiod sites), internal differences mainly referred
   to intensity variations (denoting variable abundance) rather than to
   alterations of NMR resonances positioning (denoting diversity of
   molecules). The relative disparity was largest between the Everglades
   long- and short-hydroperiod samples, whereas Pantanal and Okavango
   samples were more alike among themselves. Otherwise, molecular
   divergence was most obvious in the case of unsaturated protons (delta(H)
   > 5 ppm). 2-D NMR spectroscopy for a particular sample revealed a large
   richness of aliphatic and unsaturated substructures, likely derived from
   microbial sources such as periphyton in the Everglades. In contrast, the
   chemical diversity of aromatic wetland DOM likely originates from a
   combination of higher plant sources, progressive microbial and
   photochemical oxidation, and contributions from combustion-derived
   products (e.g., black carbon). FT-ICRMS spectra of both Okavango and
   Pantanal showed near 57 +/- 2\% CHO, 8 +/- 2\% CHOS, 33 +/- 2\% CHNO and
   <1\% CHNOS molecules, whereas those of Everglades samples were markedly
   enriched in CHOS and CHNOS at the expense of CHO and CHNO compounds. In
   particular, the Everglades short-hydroperiod site showed a large set of
   aromatic and oxygen-deficient ``black sulfur{''} compounds whereas the
   long-hydroperiod site contained oxygenated sulfur attached to fused-ring
   polyphenols. The elevated abundance of CHOS compounds for the Everglades
   samples likely results from higher inputs of agriculture-derived and
   sea-spray-derived sulfate. Although wetland DOM samples were found to
   share many molecular features, each sample was unique in its
   composition, which reflected specific environmental drivers and/or
   specific biogeochemical processes.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in planktonic
   ecosystems is carried out by diverse prokaryotic communities, whose
   growth rates and patterns of DOM utilization modulate carbon and
   nutrient biogeochemical cycles at local and global scales. Nine dilution
   experiments (September 2007 to June 2008) were conducted with surface
   water from the highly productive coastal upwelling system of the R a de
   Vigo (NW Iberian Peninsula) to estimate bacterial growth rates of six
   relevant marine bacterial groups: Roseobacter, SAR11,
   Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, SAR86 and Bacteroidetes.
   Surprisingly, SAR11 dominated over the other bacterial groups in autumn,
   likely associated to the entry of nutrient-rich, DOC-poor Eastern North
   Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) into the embayment. Roseobacter and SAR11
   showed significantly opposing growth characteristics. SAR11 consistently
   grows at low rates (range 0.19-0.71 day(-1)), while Roseobacter has a
   high growth potential (range 0.70-1.64 day(-1)). In contrast,
   Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, SAR86 and Gammaproteobacteria growth
   rates widely varied among experiments. Regardless of such temporal
   variability, mean SAR86 growth rate (range 0.1-1.4 day(-1)) was
   significantly lower than that of Gammaproteobacteria (range 0.3-2.1
   day(-1)). Whereas the relative abundance of different bacterial groups
   showed strong correlations with several environmental variables,
   group-specific bacterial growth rates did not co-vary with ambient
   conditions. Our results suggest that different bacterial groups exhibit
   characteristic growth rates, and, consequently, distinct competitive
   abilities to succeed under contrasting environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Natural seawater (NSW) sampled in March and june 2007 in the Gulf of
   Trieste, Italy, has been spiked with phenol and irradiated in a device
   simulating solar light spectrum and intensity. Opposite to the case of
   artificial seawater, for which phenol is slightly degraded by direct
   photolysis, in NSW the phenol degradation mediated by natural
   photosensitizers occurs, forming several secondary pollutants, including
   hydroxyderivatives (1,4-benzoquinone, resorcinol), three chlorophenol
   isomers, 2,3-dichlorophenol, 2- and 4-bromophenol, 2- and 4-nitrophenol,
   and several condensed products (2 and 4-phenoxyphenol, 2,2'-, 4,4'- and
   2,4-bisphenol). These compounds are toxic to bacteria and other living
   organisms. Ecotoxicologic effect has been evaluated by using the Vibrio
   Fischeri luminescent bacteria assay. This technique uses marine
   organisms, and it is therefore well suited for the study on marine
   samples. A correlation exists between the intermediates evolution and
   the toxicity profile, as the largest toxicity is observed when compounds
   with the lower EC50 (halophenols, phenoxyphenols) are formed at higher
   concentration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the transfer of Cd, methyfinercury (MeHg), and Po in an
   estuarine food chain (from phytoplankton to zooplankton {[}Daphnia
   pulex] to killifish {[}Fundulus heteroctitus] and, finally, to juvenile
   striped bass {[}Morone saxatilis]) to better understand both the extent
   to which these elements may biomagnify and the underlying mechanisms
   governing this biomagnification. Among the phytoplankton examined
   (Cyclotella meneghiniana and Chlamdomonas reinhardtii), metal uptake was
   rapid, and volume concentration factors for all metals reached values
   between 10(4) and 10(5). The resulting assimilation efficiencies (AEs)
   of ingested metals in all animals were highest for MeHg, with values
   greater than 76\%. The AEs of Cd were 21 to 33\% in D. pulex, 1 to 16\%
   in F. heteroclitus, and 38 to 56\% in M. saxatilis. Polonium AEs were 69
   to 87\% in D. pulex, 25 to 41\% in F. heteroclitus, and 9 to 21 \% in M.
   saxatilis. Loss rate constants (k(c)) of metals in D. pulex ranged from
   0.04/d for MeHg to 0.39/d for Po; metal k(c) values for F. heteroclitus
   ranged from 0.01 to 0.02/d. Using a kinetic model, we showed that the
   trophic transfer factor, defined as the ratio of metal concentration in
   predatory animals to metal concentration in prey organisms, was greater
   than unity for all three metals in D. pulex feeding on phytoplankton,
   suggesting that these metals may be biomagnified at this trophic step.
   In killifish feeding on D. pulex, the trophic transfer factor was
   consistently greater than one for MeHg, consistently less than one for
   Cd, and from 0.1 to 1.4 for Po, suggesting that both MeHg and Po have
   the potential to biomagnify at this trophic step.}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) represented the major portion of total
   organic carbon (80-95\% TOC) in the Northern South China Sea (NSCS) that
   was influenced significantly by the Kuroshio intrusion and continental
   fluxes. The concentration of DOC ranged from 70 to 85 mu M in the mixed
   layer of studied areas excluding the coastal zone. The concentration of
   particulate organic carbon (POC) was relatively low, ranging from 1.6 to
   4 mu M in the mixed layer. Distributions of DOC (43 +/- 3 mu M) and POC
   (1.1 +/- 02 mu M) were uniform in deep and bottom layers (> 1000 m) of
   the deep basin areas. However, elevated concentrations of DOC and POC up
   to 132 and 13 mu M, respectively, were found in the Zhujiang (Pearl
   River) plume during summer with the highest river discharge. Both DOC
   and POC were generally higher in shelf zones than in deep basins, and
   also higher in summer than in other seasons particularly for coastal
   zones. Terrestrial inputs and mixing processes may primarily control the
   horizontal and vertical distributions of DOC and POC in the NSCS, as
   both correlate significantly with water density and temperature but less
   significantly with salinity. Biological effect on DOC and POC
   distributions also may be significant in the central basin, as both are
   correlated well with chlorophyll a. A portion of surface DOM with poor
   nitrogen and phosphorus contents appears to be released during C-org
   syntheses inferred from stoichiometric patterns of DOM and POM in the
   euphotic zone. The degradation rate of DOC in the mixed layer is
   generally higher in the Zhujiang plume (decay coefficient: -0.045d(-1))
   than in the deep basin (-0.011 d(-1)). The labile and semi-labile
   fractions of DOC account for roughly 42-50\% of total DOC in the mixed
   layer. The increase of DOM and POM stoichiometry (C/N or C/P ratio) with
   depth in deep-basin waters implies a preferential decay of phosphorus
   (nitrogen) over carbon. Contribution of DOC oxidation to apparent oxygen
   utilization (AOU) below the mixed layer is fairly low, ranging from 11\%
   and 30\% with an average of similar to 19\%, implying that DOC may be
   largely recycled in the upper layer. Although the downward flux of DOC
   is smaller than the sinking flux of C-org, its magnitude (0.27-4.4 mmol
   Cm-2 d(-1)) constitutes a significant flux of total organic carbon
   transported through the depth of 100 or 150 m in the NSCS basin. With
   the exception of fluxes through 100 m in summer, the downward fluxes of
   total C-org are nearly balanced by new productivity derived from upward
   fluxes of nutrients by considering the estimate uncertainty. DOC appears
   to play an important role in organic carbon cycling and budgets in the
   upper layer of NSCS. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of a bacterium (Pseudomonas chlororaphis) and a
   bactivorous protozoan (Uronema sp.) on transformations of labile
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In 36-day time series experiments,
   bacteria were grown on glucose both with and without protozoa. We
   measured bulk organic carbon pools and used electrospray ionization mass
   spectrometry to characterize dissolved organic matter on a molecular
   level. Bacteria rapidly utilized glucose, depleting it to nondetectable
   levels and producing new DOC compounds of higher molecular weight within
   2 days. Some of these new compounds, representing 3 to 5\% of the
   initial glucose-C, were refractory and persisted for over a month. Other
   new compounds were produced and subsequently used by bacteria during the
   lag and exponential growth phases, pointing to a dynamic cycling of
   organic compounds. Grazers caused a temporary spike in the DOC
   concentration consisting of labile compounds subsequently utilized by
   the bacteria. Grazing did not increase the complexity of the DOC pool
   already established by the bacteria but did continually decrease the
   particulate organic carbon pool and expedited the conversion of
   glucose-C to CO, After 36 days, 29\% of initial glucose-C remained in
   pure bacteria cultures, while only 60\% remained in cultures where a
   grazer was present. In this study the bacteria were the primary shapers
   of the complex DOC continuum, suggesting higher trophic levels possibly
   have less of an impact on the qualitative composition of DOC than
   previously assumed.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence properties of whole water samples and molecular
   characteristics of ultrafiltrated dissolved organic matter (UDOM > 1,000
   D) Such as lignin phenol and neutral sugar compositions and C-13 nuclear
   magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were determined along a freshwater to
   marine gradient in Everglades National Park. Furthermore, UDOM samples
   were categorized by hierarchical cluster analysis based on their
   pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry products. Fluorescence
   properties Suggest that autochthonous DOM leached/exuded from biomass is
   quantitatively important in this system. C-13 NMR spectra showed that
   UDOM from the oligotrophic Taylor Slough (TS) and Florida Bay (FB)
   ecosystems has low aromatic C (13\% +/- 3\% for TS; 2\% +/- 2\% for FB)
   and very high O-atkyl C (54\% +/- 4\% for TS; 75\% +/- 4\% for FB)
   concentrations. High O-alkyl C concentrations in FB suggest
   seagrass/phytoplankton communities as dominant sources of UDOM. The
   amount of neutral sugars was not appreciably different between the TS
   and FB sites (115 +/- 12 mg C g C-1 UDOM) but their concentrations
   suggest a low level of diagenesis and high production rates of this
   material in this oligotrophic environment. Total yield of lignin phenols
   (vanillyl + syringyl phenols) in TS was low (0.20-0.39 mg 100 mg C-1
   UDOM) compared with other riverine environments and even lower in FB
   (0.04-0.07 ing 100 mg C-1 UDOM) and could be a result of
   photodegradation and/or dilution by other autochthonous DOM. The high
   O-alkyl and low aromatic nature of this UDOM suggests significant
   biogenic inputs (as compared with soils) and limited bioavailability in
   this ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The literature proposes that the microbial loop is a key link for
   ecosystem functioning, particularly in oligotrophic conditions. From
   original and published data for a period spanning 1986 to 1999, we
   examined the food web structure of a clear-water, oligotrophic, high
   mountain lake. The heterotrophic microbial food web was weakly developed
   in a grazing food chain dominated by copepods and phytoplankton, the
   latter mainly composed of mixotrophic flagellates. Bacteria constituted
   a minor component of the plankton community in terms of abundance,
   biomass, and production, in contrast to the situation usually reported
   in oligotrophic conditions. Abiotic and biotic factors that regulate
   bacterioplankton biomass and production were assessed, including the
   bacterivory capability of mixotrophic flagellates experimentally
   quantified by using H-3-thymidine as a tracer. Algae were the main
   factor controlling bacterioplankton. Their regulatory effect has a dual
   nature: (1) a resource-based control, through the dependence of the
   bacteria on photosynthetic carbon released by algae, i.e., a
   commensalistic interaction ({''}without you I cannot live{''}) and (2) a
   predatory control, with bacteria as prey for mixotrophs ({''}with you I
   die{''}). Mixotrophic metabolism can constitute an adaptive strategy for
   algae to overcome ultraviolet (UV) stress, by using bacteria as a source
   of carbon and mineral nutrients in conditions of inhibited
   photosynthesis and mineral nutrient uptake. Mixotrophy acts as a bypass
   of carbon flux toward the grazing food chain, explaining the scarce
   development of the heterotrophic microbes in this and other high
   mountain lakes.}},

Abstract = {{We examined various aspects of chitin degradation in order to estimate
   degradation rates and the contribution of chitin to supporting bacterial
   growth in the Delaware estuary. Hydrolysis of the chitin analog,
   methylumbelliferyl-N,N'-diacetyl-chitobioside (MUF-diNAG), and
   mineralization of C-14-chitin varied in a complex pattern in the estuary
   and correlated only weakly at best with various indices of chitin
   production. Rates of MUF-diNAG hydrolysis and C-14-chitin degradation
   were within an order of magnitude of each other, with hydrolysis rates
   usually exceeding chitin mineralization. Consistent with hydrolysis
   being greater than mineralization, we found substantial release of
   C-14-labeled dissolved organic matter (DOM) during degradation of the
   C-14-chitin; DOM release was roughly equal to respiration of
   C-14-chitin. This DOM release could support growth of bacteria not
   attached or otherwise associated with the chitin, but rates of DOM
   release and direct chitin degradation seem low relative to bacterial
   production. During 2 cruises in July and October, chitin appeared to
   support 5\% or less of bacterial production, whereas during one cruise
   in September the percentage was about 30\%. Estimates of chitin inputs
   into marine systems indicate that on the order of 10\% of bacterial
   production could be supported by chitin. Although it appears low, few
   individual biochemicals are likely to support much more bacterial growth
   than chitin, with the possible exception of protein and amino acids.}},

Abstract = {{Seawater from the northern Adriatic, with low phosphorus (0.03 mu M) and
   nitrogen (1.0 mu m NO3 and 1.0 mu M NH4) concentration, was incubated
   for 12 days in 20-1 polycarbonate carboys. The addition of a nutrient
   mixture (0.6 mu M PO4, 5.1 mu M NO3, 1.8 mu M NH4, 10.6 mu M SiO2)
   induced a strong diatom bloom, reaching 25 mu g l(-1) Chi rr, Primary
   and bacterial production were stimulated by the initial enrichment of
   nitrogen and phosphorus but ceased when N and P depletion occurred after
   4 days, inorganic N exhaustion resulted in a significant production land
   accumulation of dissolved and particulate carbohydrates. The initial
   accumulation of carbohydrates (CHO) in the particulate phase was
   followed 2 days later by a significant release of dissolved CHO. The
   bacterial response to this organic carbon source, as reflected by
   glucosidase activity, was probably inhibited by the severe P limitation
   following the phytoplankton bloom, In the exponential phase, when P
   concentration was sufficiently high to sustain a significant glucosidase
   activity, no increase in either dissolved organic carbon or dissolved
   total CHO was observed. We hypothesise that the periodic accumulation of
   dissolved organic carbon in the northern Adriatic is due to an excessive
   nitrogen enrichment followed by a concurrent N and P limitation. (C)

Abstract = {{In most estuaries, a linear relationship between fluorescence intensity
   and salinity has been frequently reported. Accordingly, it is commonly
   accepted that the dissolved organic matter in an estuary is essentially
   conservative and is not substantially modified by dilution with sea
   water. In this paper we have tried to verify whether other fluorescent
   parameters, namely the position of the fluorescence maximum and the
   apparent fluorescence efficiency (A.Fl.E.), whose variations were
   measured during estuarine mixing of waters in different European
   estuaries are consistent with this conclusion. Field observations and
   laboratory simulation experiments show that upon mixing with sea water,
   an important blue shift (congruent to 40 nm) of the fluorescence
   emission spectra as well a non-conservative evolution of the A.Fl.E. are
   observed in estuarine waters. These phenomena have been explained by a
   complex combination of processes involving mainly, the mixing of fresh
   water and marine water fluorophores having different fluorescence
   properties, but also, the loss of high molecular weight fluorescent
   matter from fresh waters possibly removed by flocculation. (C) 1997

   were determined with radiotracers. Cellular C was lost faster at
   18-degrees-C (3.6\% d-1) than at 4-degrees-C (1.0\% d-1) due to higher
   microbial activity at 18-degrees-C. C loss rates decreased (from 9.7\%
   d-1 at 18-degrees-C and 2.1\% d-1 at 4-degrees-C) after 7 d. Formalin
   (24 mM) and HgCl2 (0.9 mM) inhibited microbial activity as indicated by
   (CO2)-C-14, evolution; NaN3 (154 mM) was less effective. Poison-treated
   cells leached 33-39\% of their C (as DOC) and large quantities of Cd,
   Se, Zn, and Ag.
   Cd, Se, and Zn, primarily in a soluble fraction in the cells, were
   released at about the same rate as C and were affected by microbial
   activity and temperature. In contrast, Ag, Am, Ce, and Co were retained
   to a much greater extent by the decomposing cells, their release was
   slower than that of C, and temperature and microbial activity had
   negligible effects on their retention. The results suggest that Cd, Se,

   waters, while Ce, Am, Ag, and Co will be transported by phytoplankton
   aggregates sinking from surface waters.}},

Abstract = {{Marine chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and its related
   fluorescent components (FDOM), which are widely distributed but highly
   photobleached in the surface ocean, are critical in regulating light
   attenuation in the ocean. However, the origins of marine FDOM are still
   under investigation. Here we show that cultured picocyanobacteria,
   Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, release FDOM that closely match the
   typical fluorescent signals found in oceanic environments.
   Picocyanobacterial FDOM also shows comparable apparent fluorescent
   quantum yields and undergoes similar photo-degradation behaviour when
   compared with deep-ocean FDOM, further strengthening the similarity
   between them. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal abundant nitrogen-containing
   compounds in Synechococcus DOM, which may originate from degradation
   products of the fluorescent phycobilin pigments. Given the importance of
   picocyanobacteria in the global carbon cycle, our results indicate that
   picocyanobacteria are likely to be important sources of marine
   autochthonous FDOM, which may accumulate in the deep ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is the nitrogen (N)-containing
   component of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and in aquatic ecosystems is
   part of the biologically reactive nitrogen pool that can degrade water
   quality in N-sensitive waters. Unlike inorganic N (nitrate and ammonium)
   DON is comprised of many different molecules of variable reactivity. Few
   methods exist to track the sources of DON in watersheds. In this study,
   DOM excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence of eight discrete DON
   sources was measured and modeled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC)
   and the resulting model (FluorMod) was fit to 516 EEMs measured in
   surface waters from the main stem of the Neuse River and its
   tributaries, located in eastern North Carolina. PARAFAC components were
   positively correlated to DON concentration. Principle components
   analysis (PCA) was used to confirm separation of the eight sources and
   model validation was achieved by measurement of source samples not
   included in the model development with an error of <10\%. Application of
   FluorMod to surface waters of streams within the Neuse River Basin
   showed that while >70\% of DON was attributed to natural sources,
   nonpoint sources, such as soil and poultry litter leachates and street
   runoff, accounted for the remaining 30\%. This result was consistent
   with changes in land use from urbanized Raleigh metropolitan area to the
   largely agricultural Southeastern coastal plain. Overall, the predicted
   fraction of nonpoint DON sources was consistent with previous reports of
   increased organic N inputs in this river basin, which are suspected of
   impacting the water quality of its estuary.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra coupled with
   parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to characterize dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) derived from macrophyte decomposition, and to study
   its complexation with Cu (II) and Cd (II). Both the protein-like and the
   humic-like components showed a marked quenching effect by Cu (II).
   Negligible quenching effects were found for Cd (II) by components 1, 5
   and 6. The stability constants and the fraction of the binding
   fluorophores for humic-like components and Cu (II) can be influenced by
   macrophyte decomposition of various weight gradients in aquatic plants.
   Macrophyte decomposition within the scope of the appropriate aquatic
   phytomass can maximize the stability constant of DOM-metal complexes. A
   large amount of organic matter was introduced into the aquatic
   environment by macrophyte decomposition, suggesting that the potential
   risk of DOM as a carrier of heavy metal contamination in macrophytic
   lakes should not be ignored. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean is resistant
   to microbial degradation, yet its formation remains poorly understood.
   The fluorescent fraction of DOM can be used to trace the formation of
   recalcitrant DOM (RDOM). A long-term (> 1year) experiment revealed
   27-52\% removal of dissolved organic carbon and a nonlinear increase in
   RDOM fluorescence associated with microbial turnover of semilabile DOM.
   This fluorescence was also produced using glucose as the only initial
   carbon source, suggesting that degradation of prokaryote remnants
   contributes to RDOM. Our results indicate that the formation of a
   fluorescent RDOM component depends on the bioavailability of the
   substrate: the less labile, the larger the production of fluorescent
   RDOM relative to organic carbon remineralized. The anticipated increase
   in microbial carbon demand due to ocean warming can potentially force
   microbes to degrade less labile substrates, thereby increasing RDOM
   production and stimulating ocean carbon storage.}},

Abstract = {{Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation can have deleterious effects on coral
   assemblages in tropical and subtropical marine environments, but little
   information is available on UV penetration into ocean waters surrounding
   corals. Here we provide an extensive data set of optical properties in
   the UV domain (280{[}en] 400 nm) that were obtained during 1998-2005 at
   sites located in the Lower and Middle Keys and the Dry Tortugas.
   Absorption coefficients of the colored component of the dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC; colored dissolved organic matter {[}CDOM]) were 63
   to 253 larger than particulate absorption coefficients in the UV region,
   indicating that CDOM controls UV penetration in the inshore coastal
   waters and reef tract. CDOM absorption coefficients (a(CDOM)) and DOC
   were highly correlated to diffuse attenuation coefficients (K-d) in the
   UV spectral region. Measurements using moored sensors showed that UV
   penetration at the reef tract in the Lower Keys varies significantly
   from day to day and diurnally. The diurnal variations were linked to
   tidal currents that transport CDOM over the reef tract. Summertime
   stratification of Case 1 bluewaters near the reef tract during periods
   of low wind resulted in higher temperatures and UV penetration than that
   observed during well-mixed conditions. This result suggests that higher
   UV exposure accompanying ocean warming during low-wind doldrums
   conditions significantly contributes to coral bleaching. Modeling
   results indicate that changes in underwater sunlight attenuation over
   the coral reefs can affect UV-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage
   and inhibition of coral photosynthesis much more strongly than changes
   in the stratospheric ozone layer.}},

Abstract = {{The pools of dissolved (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) and of
   transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) were studied along two sampling
   gradients in the lagoon of New Caledonia in relation to the residence
   time of the water masses. The efficiency of the transfer of material
   from the dissolved to the particulate phase via TEP formation,
   indicating the physicochemical reactivity of organic matter, was
   investigated. DOM, POM, and TEP concentration increased along the
   sampling gradients, but their relative proportions varied. The
   contribution of the TEP pool to POM increased from 20\% to 60\%, from
   the most oligotrophic stations to the more anthropogenically affected
   bays. According to the low density of TEP and to the observed variations
   of the proportion of TEP compared with more conventional and solid
   particles, the aggregates formed inside the bays would be either
   neutrally or positively buoyant, whereas in the vicinity of the coral
   barrier, they would be negatively buoyant. As a result, the downward
   export of organic matter inside the bays might be greatly reduced,
   thereby prolonging the residence time of organic matter in the water
   column. The efficiency of the DOM/TEP transformation and the TEP
   turnover rate dropped drastically when the residence time increased from
   0 to 50 d, suggesting that the reactivity of organic matter is reduced
   as it ages. The very high residence time of the water mass inside the
   bays, constrained by the hydrodynamic circulation inside the lagoon,
   favors the installation of a feedback system in which organic matter is
   not exported and is continuously degraded, leading to the formation of
   refractory DOM with a low physicochemical reactivity. In contrast,
   organic matter produced in areas in which water mass has a low residence
   time (i.e., near the coral barrier) is rapidly exported because of its
   high physicochernical reactivity.}},

Pages = {{7771-7777}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of water temperature and the origin
   (terrestrial vs marine) and light history of chromophoric dissolved
   organic matter (CDOM) on the apparent quantum yields of carbon monoxide
   (CO) photoproduction for water samples collected along a salinity
   gradient (salinity range: 0-33) in the St. Lawrence estuarine system
   (Canada). The solar insolation-weighted mean apparent quantum yield of
   CO (Phi CO) decreased as much as fourfold with increasing salinity and
   showed a strong positive correlation with the dissolved organic
   carbonspecific absorption coefficient at 254 nm. This suggests that
   terrestrial CDOM is more efficient at photochemically producing CO than
   is marine algae-derived CDOM and that aromatic moieties are likely
   involved in this photoprocess. CDOM photobleaching, mainly at the very
   early stage, dramatically decreased h CO (by up to 6.4 times) for
   low-salinity samples, but photobleaching had little effect on the most
   marine sample. For a 20 C increase in temperature, h CO increased by
   similar to 70\% for low-salinity samples and 30-40\% for saline samples.
   This study demonstrates that water temperature, as well as the CDOM's
   origin and light history, strongly affect the efficiency of CO
   photoproduction. These factors should be taken into account in modeling
   the photochemical fluxes of CO and other related CDOM photoproducts on
   varying spatiotemporal scales.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing the substances, processes, and mechanisms that regulate
   ocean color variability is crucial for assessing marine resources and
   impacts of land-ocean interactions with remote sensing data. Bimonthly
   optical and in situ water column observations from a 3-year field
   program within the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are used to assess
   sources of ocean color variability in a semiarid coastal region.
   Correlation analyses demonstrate that remote sensing reflectance
   variability is tightly coupled to biologically and terrestrially derived
   particles throughout the visible spectrum. An empirical orthogonal
   function analysis indicates that nearly two thirds of the observed
   variability in remote sensing reflectance is contained in a
   backscattering mode, whereas phytoplankton-driven absorption processes
   contribute only similar to 30\% of the observed variance. Observations
   from the Santa Clara River outflow during a period of high discharge
   demonstrate that under extreme conditions, ocean color spectra are
   regulated almost entirely by backscattering processes. A mechanistic
   partitioning of ocean color variability confirms the dominance of
   backscattering processes and a strong coupling between the roles of
   backscattering and absorption at this site. A similar analysis of data
   from the Sargasso Sea demonstrates a lack of coupling between the role
   of absorption and backscattering. Application of the Sea-viewing Wide
   Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) operational chlorophyll algorithm
   highlights the degraded predictive power of band ratio algorithms in
   coastal settings such as the Santa Barbara Channel. For this case II
   environment, backscattering is the dominant driver of ocean color
   variability and must be correctly incorporated into future ocean color
   modeling efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of solar radiation on concentrations and microbial
   utilization of various carbon and nitrogen compounds were studied in
   July in a thermally stratified lake in southern Sweden. Exposure of
   bacteria-free water to natural sunlight in the surface of the lake for 7
   h around noon led to higher concentrations of inorganic carbon
   (39-80\%), amino acids (0-23\%) and carbohydrates (0-15\%), while lower
   concentrations of monosaccharides (0-38\%), nitrate (0-23\%) and urea
   (0-27\%) were measured. Ammonium was unchanged. Lake bacteria were
   inoculated into the irradiated water and into water that had not been
   exposed to solar radiation (dark controls). The bacterial production was
   35 to 80\% higher during exponential growth (20 h after inoculation) in
   the irradiated samples than in the controls. The bacterial utilization
   of specific carbon and nitrogen compounds in the irradiated samples
   differed from that in the controls, but the changes in the epilimnion
   and the hypolimnion varied. Dominant nutrients to the bacteria were
   carbohydrates, amino acids, glucose and ammonium. In the controls a
   release of combined amino acids (epilimnion) or carbohydrates
   (hypolimnion) occurred. An apparent non-biological removal of urea in
   the irradiated hypolimnion samples was found, since the microbial urea
   degradation was only 1\% of the reduction in concentration. Our results
   suggest that biogeochemical cycling in natural waters is influenced by
   sunlight, due to changes of microbially available components that were
   not reported previously, including amino acids, carbohydrates, nitrate
   and urea. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Molecular size plays an important role in dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   biogeochemistry, but its relationship with the fluorescent fraction of
   DOM (FDOM) remains poorly resolved. Here high-performance size exclusion
   chromatography (HPSEC) was coupled to fluorescence emission-excitation
   (EEM) spectroscopy in full spectral (60 emission and 34 excitation
   wavelengths) and chromatographic resolution (<1 Hz), to enable the
   mathematical decomposition of fluorescence on an individual sample basis
   by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The approach allowed cross-system
   comparisons of molecular size distributions for individual fluorescence
   components obtained from independent data sets. Spectra extracted from
   allochthonous DOM were highly similar. Allochthonous and autochthonous
   DOM shared some spectra, but included unique components. In agreement
   with the supramolecular assembly hypothesis, molecular size
   distributions of the fluorescence fractions were broad and
   chromatographically unresolved, possibly representing reoccurring
   fluorophores forming noncovalently bound assemblies of varying molecular
   size. Samples shared underlying fluorescence components that differed in
   their size distributions but not their spectral properties. Thus, in
   contrast to absorption measurements, bulk fluorescence is unlikely to
   reliably indicate the average molecular size of DOM. The one-sample
   approach enables robust and independent cross-site comparisons without
   large-scale sampling efforts and introduces new analytical opportunities
   for elucidating the origins and biogeochemical properties of FDOM.}},

Abstract = {{River systems play a pivotal role in transporting and transforming
   organic carbon (OC) fixed by terrestrial primary production. However,
   there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the connectivity of
   terrestrial, aquatic, and marine carbon budgets due to a lack of
   measurements along the lower (i.e. tidally-influenced) reaches of large
   river systems. For example, all estimates of carbon fluxes from the
   world's largest river, the Amazon, are based on measurements made at and
   upstream of Obidos, roughly 900 km from the mouth. Here we examine the
   evolution of OC concentrations and composition from Obidos to two
   discreet channels near the mouth of the Amazon River during five cruises
   from 2010 to 2012. OC characteristics of the Tapajos River, which enters
   the Amazon River downstream of Obidos, and the Tocantins River, which
   mixes with the Amazon River plume in the Atlantic Ocean, were also
   assessed. The average concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC)
   across the two main channels near the mouth was 0.6 +/- 03 mg L-1 during
   the study period, decreasing from 1.2 +/- 1.0 mg L-1 at Obidos. Average
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, on the other hand,
   increased from 3.9 +/- 0.6 mg L-1 at obidos to 4.2 +/- 0.9 mg L-1 across
   the mouth. The discharge of total OC to the ocean was composed of 89 +/-
   3\% dissolved load, compared to 76 +/- 13\% at Obidos. Measurements of
   bulk OC stable isotopic signatures, chlorophyll a concentrations, and
   lignin phenol abundance were used to assess unique OC sources along the
   continuum. For example, the stable isotopic composition of POC and DOC
   indicated a replacement of highland forest-derived OC with lowland and
   floodplain-derived DC from Obidos to the mouth. Likewise, lignin phenol
   signatures showed an increase in the degradation state of vascular
   plant-derived OC from Obidos to the mouth. Results from this study
   illustrate that the abundance and composition of OC continue to evolve
   along the lower reaches of large tropical rivers, which has significant
   implications on estimations of geochemical fluxes to the ocean. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The sea-surface microlayer (SML) has different physical, chemical and
   biological properties compared to the subsurface water, with an
   enrichment of organic matter i.e., dissolved organic matter including UV
   absorbing humic substances, fatty acids and many others. Here we present
   experimental evidence that dissolved organic matter, such as humic
   acids, when exposed to sunlight, can photosensitize the chemical
   conversion of linear saturated fatty acids at the air-water interface
   into unsaturated functionalized gas phase products (i.e. saturated and
   unsaturated aldehydes and acids, alkenes and dienes,.) which are known
   precursors of secondary organic aerosols. These functionalized molecules
   have previously been thought to be of biological origin, but here we
   demonstrate that abiotic interfacial photochemistry has the potential to
   produce such molecules. As the ocean is widely covered by the SML, this
   new understanding will impact on our ability to describe atmospheric

Abstract = {{Rivers discharge 2813Mmolyr(-1) of mercury (Hg) to ocean margins, an
   amount comparable to atmospheric deposition to the global oceans. Most
   of the Hg discharged by rivers is sequestered by burial of benthic
   sediment in estuaries or the coastal zone, but some is evaded to the
   atmosphere and some is exported to the open ocean. We investigate the
   fate of riverine Hg by developing a new global 3-D simulation for Hg in
   the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ocean general circulation
   model. The model includes plankton dynamics and carbon respiration
   (DARWIN project model) coupled to inorganic Hg chemistry. Results are
   consistent with observed spatial patterns and magnitudes of surface
   ocean Hg concentrations. We use observational constraints on seawater Hg
   concentrations and evasion to infer that most Hg from rivers is sorbed
   to refractory organic carbon and preferentially buried. Only 6\% of Hg
   discharged by rivers (1.8Mmolyr(-1)) is transported to the open ocean on
   a global basis. This fraction varies from a low of 2.6\% in East Asia
   due to the barrier imposed by the Korean Peninsula and Japanese
   archipelago, up to 25\% in eastern North America facilitated by the Gulf
   Stream. In the Arctic Ocean, low tributary particle loads and efficient
   degradation of particulate organic carbon by deltaic microbial
   communities favor a more labile riverine Hg pool. Evasion of Hg to the
   Arctic atmosphere is indirectly enhanced by heat transport during spring
   freshet that accelerates sea ice melt and ice rafting. Discharges of
   0.23MmolHgyr(-1) from Arctic rivers can explain the observed summer
   maximum in the Arctic atmosphere, and this magnitude of releases is
   consistent with recent observations. Our work indicates that rivers are
   major contributors to Hg loads in the Arctic Ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Proteorhodopsin (PR) is present in half of surface ocean
   bacterioplankton, where its light-driven proton pumping provides energy
   to cells. Indeed, PR promotes growth or survival in different bacteria.
   However, the metabolic pathways mediating the light responses remain
   unknown. We analyzed growth of the PR-containing Dokdonia sp. MED134
   (where light-stimulated growth had been found) in seawater with low
   concentrations of mixed {[}yeast extract and peptone (YEP)] or single
   (alanine, Ala) carbon compounds as models for rich and poor
   environments. We discovered changes in gene expression revealing a
   tightly regulated shift in central metabolic pathways between light and
   dark conditions. Bacteria showed relatively stronger light responses in
   Ala compared with YEP. Notably, carbon acquisition pathways shifted
   toward anaplerotic CO2 fixation in the light, contributing 31 +/- 8\%
   and 24 +/- 6\% of the carbon incorporated into biomass in Ala and YEP,
   respectively. Thus, MED134 was a facultative double mixotroph, i.e.,
   photo- and chemotrophic for its energy source and using both bicarbonate
   and organic matter as carbon sources. Unexpectedly, relative expression
   of the glyoxylate shunt genes (isocitrate lyase and malate synthase) was
   >300-fold higher in the light-but only in Ala-contributing a more
   efficient use of carbon from organic compounds. We explored these
   findings in metagenomes and metatranscriptomes and observed similar
   prevalence of the glyoxylate shunt compared with PR genes and highest
   expression of the isocitrate lyase gene coinciding with highest solar
   irradiance. Thus, regulatory interactions between dissolved organic
   carbon quality and central metabolic pathways critically determine the
   fitness of surface ocean bacteria engaging in PR phototrophy.}},

   The well described peaks A, C, M, B and T were found, and a new peak, A

Abstract = {{We sampled a 300-km transect along the Mackenzie River and its
   associated coastal shelf system (western Canadian Arctic) in July-August
   of 2004 to evaluate the gradients in optical, phytoplankton and
   photosynthetic characteristics. The attenuation of photo-synthetically
   available radiation (PAR) was best explained by coloured dissolved
   organic matter (CDOM) and turbidity (non-algal particles), while UV
   attenuation correlated most strongly with CDOM. Bacillariophyceae and
   Chlorophyceae dominated in the river, and shifted to Cryptophyceae and
   Prasinophyceae in the estuarine transition zone. In the coastal shelf
   waters, picoplanktonic cells dominated the surface autotrophic
   communities while both large and small cells occurred in the deep
   chlorophyll maximum. High PAR attenuation reduced the integral primary
   production rate in the river, while at an offshore marine site, 55\% of
   integral production was at or below the pycnocline, under low PAR.
   Climate change is likely to increase the sediment and CDOM loading to
   these waters, which would exacerbate light limitation of photosynthesis
   throughout the system.}},

Abstract = {{The current knowledge of micro- and macroaggregates in running waters as
   well as an assessment of their importance will be given in this
   overview. Micro- and macroscopic aggregates are an abundant component of
   running waters, considering both rivers and estuaries. They are composed
   of different kinds of organic and inorganic matter and elements, mainly
   from the aquatic but also from the terrestrial environment. Their
   production is determined by natural and anthropogenically influenced
   abiotic and biotic factors. Aggregate abundance, size and composition
   vary greatly along the longitudinal profile of running waters.
   Aggregates are actively or passively colonized by bacteria, protozoa
   (amoebae, ciliates and flagellates) and metazoa (copepods, nematodes,
   rotifers, veliger larvae) and they show higher loads of nutrients and
   organisms compared to the surrounding water. Detritus in running waters
   has been examined over a period of 100 years but investigations of
   single aggregates began only in 1996, after pioneering works in the
   marine field and in lakes. Since then studies have been focused on
   several aspects of aggregate formation, colonization, nutrient recycling
   and decomposition. Aggregates have been identified as foci of microbial
   activity. It has been shown that the significance of aggregate -
   associated organisms and processes varies both temporally and spatially
   and is also affected by the nutrient status of surrounding water. An
   important conclusion from recent studies is that the resuspension and
   sedimentation of aggregates connects pelagic and benthic food webs to an
   aquatic food web. It also underlines the importance of the microbial
   food web, with its fluxes among aggregate-associated picoand
   nano-organisms, to organisms of higher trophic levels. Predators of
   higher trophic levels are only able to eat small-sized organisms if they
   are associated to aggregates.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We examined heterotrophic bacterial nutrient limitation at four sites in
   Florida Bay, U.S. in summer 1994 and winter 1995. Bacterial growth and
   biomass production in this system were most limited by inorganic
   phosphorus (P) in the eastern and southern regions of the bay. Nutrient
   additions stimulated productivity and biomass accumulation mostly in
   summer. The magnitude of growth responses (thymidine incorporation) to
   nutrient additions was nearly an order of magnitude less in winter than
   summer. Biomass-normalized alkaline phosphatase activity in the
   northeast and south-central region was 5-20 times greater than in the
   northwest and north-central regions, suggesting that P is most limiting
   to planktonic growth in those areas. Chlorophyll levels were higher in
   the northwest and north-central regions and P-uptake into particles > 1
   mum, primarily phytoplankton, was also higher in these regions.
   Consistent with these observations, others have observed that P is
   advected into the bay primarily in the northwestern region. Abundant
   seagrasses in Florida Bay may promote heterotrophic bacterial production
   relative to phytoplankton production by releasing dissolved organic
   carbon that makes bacteria more competitive for limiting quantities of
   inorganic phosphate, especially in the eastern bay where turbidity is
   low, P is most limiting, and light levels reaching the benthic plants
   are high.}},

   in highest concentration in seawater collected from a mangrove swamp

   and hazardous impact on the marine environment worldwide. Seawater
   samples were collected monthly from December 2013 to November 2014 in
   the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Marseille Bay). The samples were
   analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as well as the molecular
   distribution of dissolved PAEs by using solid phase extraction followed
   by gas chromatography andmass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses. The results
   demonstrated the occurrence of six PAEs, including dimethyl phthalate
   (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl
   phthalate (DnBP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BzBP) and diethylhexyl
   phthalate (DEHP), with total concentrations ranging from 130 to 1330 ng
   L-1 (av. 522 ng L-1). In Marseille Bay, the highest concentrations were
   detected in the bottom water from June to November 2014 and in the whole
   water column during the winter mixing period. This result suggests that
   resuspension of PAErich sediment, in relation to the accumulation of
   plastic debris above the seabed, or the higher degradation rate in the
   upper layer of the water column, plays a significant role in the PAE
   dynamics in coastal water. DEHP was the most abundant PAE in all of the
   surface samples and the summer bottom samples, followed by DiBP and
   DnBP, which also represent the largest fractions in the other bottom
   samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Heterotrophic microbial communities cycle nearly half of net primary
   productivity in the ocean, and play a particularly important role in
   transformations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The specific means by
   which these communities mediate the transformations of organic carbon
   are largely unknown, since the vast majority of marine bacteria have not
   been isolated in culture, and most measurements of DOC degradation rates
   have focused on uptake and metabolism of either bulk DOC or of simple
   model compounds (e. g. specific amino acids or sugars). Genomic
   investigations provide information about the potential capabilities of
   organisms and communities but not the extent to which such potential is
   expressed. We tested directly the capabilities of heterotrophic
   microbial communities in surface ocean waters at 32 stations spanning
   latitudes from 76 degrees S to 79 degrees N to hydrolyze a range of high
   molecular weight organic substrates and thereby initiate organic matter
   degradation. These data demonstrate the existence of a latitudinal
   gradient in the range of complex substrates available to heterotrophic
   microbial communities, paralleling the global gradient in bacterial
   species richness. As changing climate increasingly affects the marine
   environment, changes in the spectrum of substrates accessible by
   microbial communities may lead to shifts in the location and rate at
   which marine DOC is respired. Since the inventory of DOC in the ocean is
   comparable in magnitude to the atmospheric CO2 reservoir, such a change
   could profoundly affect the global carbon cycle.}},

Abstract = {{We followed a long-term (up to 503 days) microbial mineralization of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from lake water in a bioassay and
   described the kinetics of biodegradation with a new model based on a
   reactivity continuum approach. The biodegradability of DOC was expressed
   as the probability of biodegradation, which was assumed to follow a beta
   distribution. We compared the performance of our beta model to five
   earlier models: the simplest first order kinetic model, two G models,
   the power model and the gamma model. The simplest first order kinetic
   model described the decreasing microbial mineralization of DOC poorly (r
   (2) = 0.73), but the other models explained the observed kinetics of
   biodegradation well (r (2) > 0.95). When we assessed the extrapolation
   power of models beyond the length of the bioassay by reducing the amount
   of data, the predictive power of the G models was poor. Instead, the
   beta model predicted the biodegradation kinetics consistently and
   correctly based on even only three observations in time. The beta model
   provided also long-term predictions (up to 5,000 years) along the
   observed long-term mineralization trajectory of organic carbon in
   sediments. Additionally, the beta model formulated the biodegradability
   continuum of DOC, which was skewed towards low biodegradability. During
   the bioassay, the skew towards low biodegradability increased as the
   most biodegradable parts of DOC were consumed. The beta model describes
   the biodegradability continuum quantitatively and can predict
   biodegradation in a realistic manner, thus, improving our understanding
   about the biodegradability and the role of natural organic matter in the
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial productivity and biomass are thought to be limited by
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in much of the world's oceans. However,
   the mixed layer of oligotrophic oceans is often depleted in dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen and phosphate, raising the possibility that
   macronutrients may also limit heterotrophic bacterial growth. We used
   nutrient bioassay experiments to determine whether inorganic nutrients
   (N, P, Fe) and/or DOC could limit bacterial productivity and biomass in
   the central North Atlantic during the spring of 2004 (Mar-Apr). We
   observed that both heterotrophic bacterial productivity and biomass were
   co-limited by N and P in the oligotrophic North Atlantic, and additions
   of labile DOC (glucose) provided no stimulation unless N and P were also
   added. Flow cytometry results indicated that only a small subset of
   large cells high in nucleic acid content were responsible for the
   increased productivity in the combined NP amendments. In contrast,
   nutrient additions elicited no net change on the dominant component of
   the bacterial population, composed of small cells with relatively low
   nucleic acid content. In the combined NP treatments the relative
   increase in bacterial production was greater than that measured when
   phytoplankton productivity was relieved of nitrogen limitation. These
   results suggest that N and P co-limitation in the bacterial community
   results in increased competition between the heterotrophic and
   autotrophic components of the surface communities in the Central North
   Atlantic Ocean, and potentially impacts the cycling of organic matter by
   the bacterioplankton.}},

Abstract = {{Porewater equilibration samplers were used to obtain porewater
   inventories of inorganic nutrients (NH4+, NOx, PO43-), dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), sulfate (SO42-), dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), chloride (Cl-), methane (CH4) and
   reduced iron (Fe2+) in intertidal creek-bank sediments at eight sites in
   three estuarine systems over a range of salinities and seasons. Sulfate
   reduction (SR) rates and sediment particulate organic carbon (POC) and
   nitrogen (PON) were also determined at several of the sites. Four sites
   in the Okatee River estuary in South Carolina, two sites on Sapelo
   Island, Georgia and one site in White Oak Creek, Georgia appeared to be
   relatively pristine. The eighth site in Umbrella Creek, Georgia was
   directly adjacent to a small residential development employing septic
   systems to handle household waste. The large data set (> 700 porewater
   profiles) offers an opportunity to assess system-scale patterns of
   porewater biogeochemical dynamics with an emphasis on DOC and DON
   distributions. SO42- depletion (SO42-)(Dep) was used as a proxy for SR,
   and (SO42-)(Dep) patterns agreed with measured (S-35) patterns of SR.
   There were significant system-scale correlations between the inorganic
   products of terminal metabolism (DIC, NH4+ and PO43-) and (SO42-)(Dep),
   and SR appeared to be the dominant terminal carbon oxidation pathway in
   these sediments. Porewater inventories of DIC and (SO42-)(Dep) indicate
   a 2:1 stoichiometry across sites, and the C:N ratio of the organic
   matter undergoing mineralization was between 7.5 and 10. The data
   suggest that septic-derived dissolved organic matter with a C:N ratio
   below 6 fueled microbial metabolism and SR at a site with development in
   the upland. Seasonality was observed in the porewater inventories, but
   temperature alone did not adequately describe the patterns of
   (SO42-)(Dep), terminal metabolic products (DIC, NH4+, PO43-), DOC and
   DON, and SR observed in this study. It appears that production and
   consumption of labile DOC are tightly coupled in these sediments, and
   that bulk DOC is likely a recalcitrant pool. Preferential hydrolysis of
   PON relative to POC when overall organic matter mineralization rates
   were high appears to drive the observed patterns in POC:PON, DOC:DON and
   DIC:DIN ratios. These data, along with the weak seasonal patterns of SR
   and organic and inorganic porewater inventories, suggest that the rate
   of hydrolysis limits organic matter mineralization in these intertidal
   creek-bank sediments.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the source and magnitude of: the variability of bio-optical

   properties (IOPs) and biogeochemical quantities during late summer from
   the eutrophic waters of the Moroccan upwelling to the oligotrophic
   waters of the northwestern Mediterranean and the ultraoligotrophic
   waters of the eastern Mediterranean. Vertical distributions of spectral
   absorption and attenuation coefficients were measured with a
   high-resolution in Situ spectrophotometer (WETLabs ac9) together with
   biogeochemical measurements that included phytoplanktonic pigments and
   particulate organic carbon concentrations, particle size distributions,
   and picoplankton abundance. The variability in specific lops (i.e., per
   unit of biogeochemical constituent concentration) was examined, and an
   optical index of particle size wits derived. The fine-scale vertical
   distributions of various biogeochemical properties were thus described
   from ac9 profiles. Particle attenuation and carbon budgets, estimated
   from a combination of optical and biogeochemical measurements, underlie
   a major contribution of nonalgal stocks in oceanic waters. We show that
   first-order variations in IOPs in oceanic waters are explained by the
   trophic state (i.e., chlorophyll a concentration) and that second-order
   variations are the result Of changes in the composition of phytoplankton
   assemblage, the balance between algal and nonalgal stocks, and
   light-related processes (colored dissolved organic material
   photo-oxidation and algal photo-adaptation).}},

   30\% reduction, respectively). The origin of the extracellular carbon
   appeared also to affect the taxonomic composition of the
   bacterioplankton assemblage, mainly reducing the development of
   gamma-Proteobacteria. This pattern of bacterial carbon uptake could
   contribute to a longer persistence of the exudates released in
   P-depleted conditions affecting the dynamics of the carbon cycle in

Title = {{Molecular alteration of marine dissolved organic matter under

Abstract = {{Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a large (660 Pg) pool of
   reduced carbon that is subject to thermal alteration in hydrothermal
   systems and sedimentary basins. In natural high-temperature hydrothermal
   systems, DOM is almost completely removed, but the mechanism and
   temperature dependence of this removal have not been studied to date. We
   investigated molecular-level changes to DOM that was solid-phase
   extracted (SPE-DOM) from the deep ocean of the North Pacific Ocean. This
   complex molecular mixture was experimentally exposed to temperatures
   between 100 and 380 degrees C over the course of two weeks in artificial
   seawater, and was then characterised on a molecular level via
   ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry
   (FT-ICR-MS). Almost 93\% of SPE-DOM was removed by the treatment at 380
   degrees C, and this removal was accompanied by a consistent pattern of
   SPE-DOM alteration across the temperatures studied. Higher molecular
   weight and more oxygen rich compounds were preferentially removed,
   suggesting that decarboxylation and dehydration of carboxylic acid and
   alcohol groups are the most rapid degradation mechanisms. Nitrogen
   containing compounds followed the same overall trends as those
   containing just C, H and O up to 300 degrees C. Above this temperature,
   the most highly altered samples contained very little of the original
   character of marine DOM, instead being mainly composed of very low
   intensity N- and S-containing molecules with a high H/C ratio (>1.5).
   Our results suggest that abiotic hydrothermal alteration of SPE-DOM may
   already occur at temperatures above 68 degrees C. Our experiments were
   conducted without a sedimentary or mineral phase, and demonstrate that
   profound molecular alteration and almost complete removal of marine
   SPE-DOM requires nothing more than heating in a seawater matrix. (C)

Abstract = {{Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the major absorber of sunlight
   in most natural waters and a critical component of carbon cycling in
   aquatic systems. The combined effect of light absorbance properties and
   related photo-production of reactive species are essential in
   determining the reactivity of DOM. Optical properties and in particular
   excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy combined with
   parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) have been used increasingly to
   track sources and fate of DOM. Here we describe studies conducted in
   water from two estuarine systems in the Florida Everglades, with a
   salinity gradient of 2 to 37 and dissolved organic carbon concentrations
   from 19.3 to 5.74 mg C L-1, aimed at assessing how the quantity and
   quality of DOM is coupled to the formation rates and steady-state
   concentrations of reactive species including singlet oxygen, hydroxyl
   radical, and the triplet excited state of DOM. These species were
   related to optical properties and PARAFAC components of the DOM. The
   formation rate and steady-state concentration of the carbonate radical
   was calculated in all samples. The data suggests that formation rates,
   particularly for singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals, are strongly
   coupled to the abundance of terrestrial humic-like substances. A
   decrease in singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, and carbonate radical
   formation rates and steady-state concentration along the estuarine
   salinity gradient was observed as the relative concentration of
   terrestrial humic-like DOM decreased due to mixing with microbial
   humic-like and protein-like DOM components, while the formation rate of
   triplet excited-state DOM did not change. Fluorescent DOM was also found
   to be more tightly coupled to reactive species generation than
   chromophoric DOM.}},

Abstract = {{Remineralization of organic matter in reactive marine sediments releases
   nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) into the ocean. Here we
   focused on the molecular-level characterization of DOM by
   high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
   spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) in sediment pore waters and bottom waters from
   contrasting redox regimes in the northern Black Sea with particular
   emphasis on nitrogen-bearing compounds to derive an improved
   understanding of the molecular transformations involved in nitrogen
   release. The number of nitrogen-bearing molecules is generally higher in
   pore waters than in bottom waters. This suggests intensified degradation
   of nitrogen-bearing precursor molecules such as proteins in anoxic
   sediments: No significant difference was observed between sediments
   deposited under oxic vs anoxic conditions (average O/C ratios of 0.55)
   suggesting that the different organic matter quality induced by
   contrasting redox conditions does not impact protein diagenesis in the
   subseafloor. Compounds in the pore waters were on average larger, less
   oxygenated, and had a higher number of unsaturations. Applying a
   mathematical model, we could show that the assemblages of
   nitrogen-bearing molecular formulas are potential products of
   proteinaceous material that was transformed by the following reactions:
   (a) hydrolysis and deamination, both reducing the molecular size and
   nitrogen content of the products and intermediates; (b) oxidation and
   hydration of the intermediates; and (c) methylation and dehydration.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{Fluvial and erosional release processes in permafrost-dominated Eurasian
   Arctic cause transport of large amounts of particulate organic carbon
   (POC) to coastal waters. The marine fate of this terrestrial POC
   (terr-POC), water column degradation, burial in shelf sediments, or
   export to depth, impacts the potential for climate-carbon feedback. As
   part of the International Siberian Shelf Study (ISSS-08;
   August-September 2008), the POC distribution, inventory, and fate in the
   water column of the extensive yet poorly studied Eurasian Arctic Shelf
   seas were investigated. The POC concentration spanned 1-152 mu M, with
   highest values in the SE Laptev Sea. The POC inventory was constrained
   for the Laptev (1.32 +/- 0.09 Tg) and East Siberian seas (2.85 +/- 0.20
   Tg). A hydraulic residence time of 3.5 +/- 2 years for these Siberian
   shelf seas yielded a combined annual terr-POC removal flux of 3.9 +/-
   1.4 Tg yr(-1). Accounting for sediment burial and shelf-break exchange,
   the terr-POC water column degradation was similar to 2.5 +/- 1.6 Tg
   yr(-1), corresponding to a first-order terr-POC degradation rate
   constant of 1.4 +/- 0.9 yr(-1), which is 5-10 times faster than reported
   for terr-DOC degradation in the Arctic Ocean. This terr-POC degradation
   flux thus contributes substantially to the dissolved inorganic carbon
   excess of 10 Tg C observed during ISSS-08 for these waters. This
   evaluation suggests that extensive decay of terr-POC occurs already in
   the water column and contributes to outgassing of CO2. This process
   should be considered as a geographically dislocated carbon-climate
   coupling where thawing of vulnerable permafrost carbon on land is
   eventually adding CO2 above the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Severe tropical storms play an important role in triggering
   phytoplankton blooms, but the extent to which such storms influence
   biogenic carbon flux from the euphotic zone is unclear. In 2008, typhoon
   Fengwong provided a unique opportunity to study the in situ biological
   responses including phytoplankton blooms and particulate organic carbon
   fluxes associated with a severe storm in the southern East China Sea
   (SECS). After passage of the typhoon, the sea surface temperature (SST)
   in the SECS was markedly cooler (similar to 25 to 26 degrees C) than
   before typhoon passage (similar to 28 to 29 degrees C). The POC flux 5
   days after passage of the typhoon was 265 +/- 14 mg Cm-2 d(-1), which
   was similar to 1.7-fold that (140-180 mg Cm-2 d(-1)) recorded during a
   period (June-August, 2007) when no typhoons occurred. A somewhat smaller
   but nevertheless significant increase in POC flux (224-225 mg Cm-2
   d(-1)) was detected following typhoon Sinlaku which occurred
   approximately 1 month after typhoon Fengwong, indicating that typhoon
   events can increase biogenic carbon flux efficiency in the SECS.
   Remarkably, phytoplankton uptake accounted for only about 5\% of the
   nitrate injected into the euphotic zone by typhoon Fengwong. It is
   likely that phytoplankton population growth was constrained by a
   combination of light limitation and grazing pressure. Modeled estimates
   of new/export production were remarkably consistent with the average of
   new and export production following typhoon Fengwong. The same model
   suggested that during non-typhoon conditions approximately half of the
   export of organic carbon occurs via convective mixing of dissolved
   organic carbon, a conclusion consistent with earlier work at comparable
   latitudes in the open ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding absorbance photobleaching of marine dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) is important because DOM chromophores impact oceanic
   primary productivity by affecting the depth of the photic zone, absorb
   UV radiation and affect ocean color used in remote sensing. However, the
   fundamental mechanisms which account for this bleaching are largely
   unknown. Controlled laboratory studies demonstrated that the presence of
   seawater concentrations of chloride and bromide ions enhanced absorbance
   photobleaching reaction rates by similar to 40\%, regardless of DOM
   source or the presence or absence of carbonate ions. In contrast, halide
   ions generally did not affect fluorescence bleaching rates. Variations
   in ionic strength did not alter the enhancement in absorbance
   photobleaching by halide ions. Accordingly, the enhancement in
   absorbance photobleaching was specific to halide ions, rather than a
   generalized salinity effect. We confirmed the formation of hydroxyl
   radical (HO center dot) in illuminated samples, and its significant
   scavenging in the presence of halide salts. Gamma-radiolysis experiments
   and associated modeling indicated that a small component (similar to
   12\%) of the photobleaching enhancement by halides was consistent with
   the hypothesis that halide scavenging of HO center dot will form
   reactive halogen radicals that target electron-rich chromophores within
   DOM more selectively than HO center dot The mechanism responsible for
   the major component of absorbance photobleaching rate enhancement by
   halides remains unresolved. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the distribution, photoproduction, microbial uptake, and
   air-sea exchange of carbon monoxide (CO), a key photoproduct of
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter ( CDOM), in open waters of the
   southeastern Beaufort Sea in autumn 2003 and spring 2004. Diurnal cycles
   of surface water CO concentration ({[}CO]) occurred in autumn but not in
   spring. In both seasons {[}CO] was well above air-equilibrium at most
   stations (maximum of 12,500\% saturation) and dropped with depth to
   undetectable levels below 50 m. Mean surface water {[}CO] and CO
   water-column burdens (0-50 m) were 0.45 mu mol L-1 and 5.0 mu mol m(-2)
   in autumn and 4.7 nmol L-1 and 64.8 mu mol m(-2) in spring, and the
   sea-to-air CO flux was 33 times higher in spring. The efficiency of CO
   photoproduction correlated linearly with CDOM across the Mackenzie River
   estuary, the Mackenzie Shelf, and the Amundsen Gulf. Modeled
   water-column CO photoproduction in spring was 15 times that in autumn
   (45.8 vs. 3.0 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)). Microbial CO uptake followed
   first-order kinetics in autumn while Hill-type, saturation, and
   inhibition kinetics were common in surface waters in spring.
   Bio-oxidation was the dominant CO loss term in autumn while gas exchange
   was almost equally important in spring. Higher photoproduction and
   slower bio-uptake in spring resulted in the wide autumn-spring
   differences in the {[}CO] distribution pattern and air-sea CO flux. CO
   cycling in cold northern waters differs both quantitatively and
   qualitatively from that in warmer seas.}},

Title = {{Aerobic biodegradation of polyethylene glycols of different molecular

Number = {{19}},

Abstract = {{in order to distinguish between aerobic biodegradation of synthetic
   polymers in fresh and seawater, polyethylene glycols (PEGS) were
   systematically and comparatively investigated in inocula from municipal
   wastewater and seawater aquarium filters for the first time. The
   molecular weight (MW) of the PEGS, (HO(CH2CH2O)(n)H, n = 3-1350) as
   representatives of water-soluble polymers, ranged from 250 to 57,800 Da.
   The biodegradation was observed by removal of dissolved organic carbon
   and carbon dioxide production by applying standardized ISO and OECD test
   methods. Specific analyses using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
   mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) were performed. All PEGS selected were
   completely biodegradable in freshwater media within 65 d. PEGS with an
   MW up to 14,600 Da have a similar degradation pathway which is
   characterized by gradual splitting of C-2-units off the chain resulting
   in formation of short-chain PEGS. In artificial seawater media, full
   biodegradation of PEGS up to 7400 Da required more time than in
   freshwater. PEGS with MW 10,300 and 14,600 Da were only partially
   degraded whereas PEGS with MW 26,600 and 57,800 Da were not degraded for
   a period of 135 d. The biodegradation pathway of PEG 250 and PEG 970 in
   seawater is similar to that for freshwater. For PEGS having an MW from
   2000 to 10,300 Da, the degradation pathway in seawater differs from the
   pathway of the shorter PEGS. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reversed-phase liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is
   introduced as a new molecular fingerprinting technique for tracing
   terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its photochemical decay
   in the ocean. DOM along a transect from the mangrove-fringed coast in
   Northern Brazil to the shelf edge was compared with mangrove-derived
   porewater DOM exposed to natural sunlight for 2-10 days in a
   photodegradation experiment. DOM was isolated from all samples via
   solid-phase extraction (C18) for LC/MS analysis. DOM in the estuary and
   ocean showed a bimodal mass distribution with two distinct maxima in the
   lower m/z range from 400 to 1000 Da (intensity-weighted average of 895
   Da). Terrigenous porewater DOM from the mangroves was characterized by a
   broad molecular mass distribution over the detected range from 150 to
   2000 Da (intensity-weighted average of 1130 Da). Polar compounds, i.e.,
   those that eluted early in the reversed-phase chromatography, absorbed
   more UV light and bad on average smaller molecular masses than the more
   apolar compounds.
   After 10 days of irradiation (similar to 70 kWh/m(2)), mangrove DOM
   resembled open-ocean DOM in its mass distribution (intensity-weighted
   average of 885 Da). In addition, a large fraction of UV-absorbing
   compounds, which were present in mangrove samples but absent in offshore
   samples, were not detected after photodegradation. However, the bimodal
   mass distribution in ocean waters was not reproduced during
   photodegradation. This mass distribution is certainly a reflection of
   specific molecular properties of marine DOM which systematically
   differed from the mangrove samples. The molecular patterns of DOM in the
   ocean did not show significant contribution of terrigenous DOM, which is
   in contrast to previous stable carbon isotope analysis. If, however,
   photochemical modifications of the terrigenous component are considered
   as an additional mechanism besides simple mixing of two end members
   (marine and mangrove), the observed molecular patterns of oceanic DOM
   are consistent with the contribution of terrigenous DOM in these
   samples. In order to explore the molecular mass information, the mass
   spectra of the different samples were compared through multivariate
   statistics. Cluster analyses and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS)
   revealed significant differences between mangrove and oceanic DOM that
   successively disappeared in the course of the photodegradation
   experiment. With help of discriminant analyses, the similarity between
   photodegraded mangrove DOM and open-ocean DOM could be confirmed on an
   individual m/z level. Though conventional ion trap mass spectrometry
   (resolving power of similar to 1000) does not resolve the complexity of
   DOM at the level of single molecules, it does provide detailed molecular
   fingerprints. This molecular fingerprinting technique provides a means
   to trace DOM and modifications in its molecular structure in aquatic
   systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the waters from Lake Biwa, Japan was
   fractionated using tangential flow ultrafiltration, and subsequently
   characterized by fluorescence properties and amino acids. While major
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance (Abs), humic-like
   fluorescence (Flu) and total hydrolyzed amino acids (THAA) occurred in
   the less than 5 kDa molecular size fraction, they were not evenly
   distributed among various molecular size fractions. Flu/Abs ratios
   increased, and THAA/DOC ratios decreased with decreasing molecular size.
   Humic-like fluorescence occurred in all molecular size fractions, but
   protein-like fluorescence only occurred in the 0.1 mum-GF/F fraction.
   Subtle differences in amino acid compositions (both individuals and
   functional groups) were observed between various molecular size
   fractions, this may indicate the occurrence of DOM degradation from
   higher to lower molecular weight. The results reported here have

   microorganisms reduced the microbial degradation of fresh detritus at
   the surface by 20\% compared with defaunated sediment. Enhanced
   microbial degradability after passage through the gut of N. diversicolor
   was probably responsible for a 20\% increase in microbial decay of
   surface-deposited aged detritus in faunated compared to defaunated
   sediment. The decay of subsurface-deposited fresh and aged detritus in
   defaunated sediment (k(POC) = 10 x 10(-3) and 3 x 10(-3) d(-1),
   respectively) was ca. half of that for surf ace-deposited detritus.
   Activities of N. diversicolor (irrigation and feeding) increased the
   degradation of buried (POC)-C-14 by 160 and 270\% for fresh and aged
   detritus, respectively. The irrigation-associated stimulation of
   microbial decomposition by injection of oxygen into and removal of toxic
   metabolites from sediment was 90 and 300\% for fresh and aged detritus,
   respectively. The several-fold enhancement of microbial decay of aged
   subsurface detritus substantiates the importance of burrow irrigation
   and oxygenation for degradation of otherwise refractory detritus in
   sediments. In the absence of irrigated burrows, a larger fraction of
   partly degraded detritus may remain undegraded and be buried permanently
   in the sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced sulfur gases and optical properties were measured in the upper
   ocean during an Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise of the RRS James
   Clark Ross from England to the Falkland Islands in 1998. Sea surface
   concentrations of carbonyl sulfide (COS) exhibited a pronounced diel
   variation at low latitudes but no diel cycle at mid and high latitudes
   possibly because of oceanic fronts and the longer hydrolysis time
   constant in cold water. The highest COS concentrations were observed in
   coastal and upwelling areas. CS2 concentrations varied less than those
   of COS, and the highest concentrations were found in the North African
   upwelling area with decreasing concentrations both northward and
   southward of this maximum. Dimethylsulfide (DMS) had the largest
   concentrations in the upper ocean, but methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) was an
   important reduced sulfur species in some coastal and upwelling areas.
   This may be associated with high bacterial growth rates. Colored
   dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence and absorbance also exhibit
   the highest values in coastal and upwelling areas and the lowest values
   in the southern subtropical gyre. The results suggest that carbon
   disulfide (CS2) outgassed from the oceans and oxidized in the atmosphere
   may represent a larger source of COS to the atmosphere than the direct
   flux of COS across the sea-air interface.}},

Abstract = {{The initial benthic degradation of senescent Zostera marina leaves was
   studied in controlled flowthrough microcosm chambers for 33 d. Sediment
   chambers without added eelgrass leaves served as control chambers. The
   inflowing artificial seawater and ouflowing seawater were analyzed for
   dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON), total
   acid-hydrolyzable amino acids (THAA), dissolved free amino acids (DFAA),
   urea, NH4+, NO3-, Sigma CO2, and O-2 during the 33 d of incubation.
   Sediment profiles of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, sediment
   acid-hydrolyzable amino acids, DON, DFAA, urea, NH4+ and the turnover
   rate of urea were measured at four different times during the 33 d of
   incubation. There was an immediate increase in carbon oxidation and the
   effluxes of DOC, DON, and NH4+ after the addition of eelgrass leaves to
   the sediment surface. During the course of incubation, 24.3\% of the DON
   efflux was identified as acid-hydrolyzable amino acids, dissolved free
   amino acids, and urea in the chambers with eelgrass addition, whereas
   these compounds accounted for 33.8\% of the DON efflux in the control
   chambers. There were indications of a stimulated bacterial growth on the
   eelgrass leaves during the first 7 d after leaf addition that was
   measured as an increase in acid-hydrolyzable amino acids. Further, there
   was a gradual increase in acid-hydrolyzable amino acids in the sediment
   throughout the incubation that could only be explained as bacterial
   growth (and/or protein synthesis). Most of the nitrogen for microbial
   growth was mobilized from the indigenous particulate organic nitrogen
   pool, whereas it could be inferred that the energy source for bacterial
   growth was mainly supplied from the added eelgrass leaves. Most of the
   nitrogen mineralized within the sediment was incorporated into the
   microbial biomass with a resultant low efflux of inorganic nitrogen from
   the sediment to the water column.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{313-324}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Seasonal algal blooms in freshwater and marine water can increase the
   input of algal organic matter (AOM) to the pool of dissolved organic
   matter. The impact of bromide (Br-) and iodide (I-) on the formation of
   regulated and unregulated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) was studied
   from chlorination of AOM solutions extracted from three species of
   cultured isolates of freshwater and marine algae (Microcystis aeruginosa
   (MA), Synechococcus (SYN), and Alexandrium tamarense (AT)). Comparable
   concentrations of DBPs were formed from three types of AOM. In the
   absence of Br-, trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and
   haloacetaldehydes (HALs) were the main groups of DBP formed, and
   haloacetonitriles (HANs) were formed at lower concentrations. In
   contrast, the formation of iodinated THMs was <8 nM (1.7 mu g/L) since
   most of initial I- was oxidized to iodate. Increasing initial Br-
   concentrations increased the formation of THMs and HANs, while
   concentrations of total organic halogen and HAA remained stable. On the
   contrary, total HAL concentrations decreased due to the instability of
   bromated HALs. Decreasing the specific UV absorbance (SUVA) value of AOM
   favours bromine substitution since bromine more preferentially reacts
   with low reactivity organic matter than chlorine. Increasing the pH
   enhanced the formation of THMs but decreased the formation of HANs.
   Concentrations of HANs and HALs decreased at high pH (e.g., 9.0), high
   initial chlorine concentration and long reaction time due to the
   decomposition. Based on the cytotoxicity calculations, unregulated HANs
   and HALs were the main contributors for the total toxicity of DBPs
   measured, even though based on the weight regulated THMs and HAAs
   predominated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Selective removal of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the marine
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool has been reported in several
   regional studies. Because DOM is an important advective/mixing pathway
   of carbon (C) export from the ocean surface layer and its
   non-Redfieldian stoichiometry would affect estimates of marine export
   production per unit N and P, we investigated the stoichiometry of marine
   DOM and its remineralization globally using a compiled DOM data set.
   Marine DOM is enriched in C and N compared to Redfield stoichiometry,
   averaging 317: 39: 1 and 810: 48: 1 for C: N: P within the degradable
   and total bulk pools, respectively. Dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP)
   is found to be preferentially remineralized about twice as rapidly with
   respect to the enriched C: N stoichiometry of marine DOM. Biogeochemical
   simulations with the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling model using
   Redfield and variable DOM stoichiometry corroborate the need for
   non-Redfield dynamics to match the observed DOM stoichiometry. From our
   model simulations, preferential DOP remineralization is found to
   increase the strength of the biological pump by similar to 9\% versus
   the case of Redfield DOM cycling. Global net primary productivity
   increases similar to 10\% including an increase in marine nitrogen
   fixation of similar to 26\% when preferential DOP remineralization and
   direct utilization of DOP by phytoplankton are included. The largest
   increases in marine nitrogen fixation, net primary productivity, and
   carbon export are observed within the western subtropical gyres,
   suggesting the lateral transfer of P in the form of DOP from the
   productive eastern and poleward gyre margins may be important for
   sustaining these processes downstream in the subtropical gyres.}},

Abstract = {{Although the Arctic Ocean is the most riverine-influenced of all of the
   world's oceans, the importance of terrigenous nutrients in this
   environment is poorly understood. This study couples estimates of
   circumpolar riverine nutrient fluxes from the PARTNERS (Pan-Arctic River
   Transport of Nutrients, Organic Matter, and Suspended Sediments) Project
   with a regionally configured version of the MIT general circulation
   model to develop estimates of the distribution and availability of
   dissolved riverine N in the Arctic Ocean, assess its importance for
   primary production, and compare these estimates to potential bacterial
   production fueled by riverine C. Because riverine dissolved organic
   nitrogen is remineralized slowly, riverine N is available for uptake
   well into the open ocean. Despite this, we estimate that even when
   recycling is considered, riverine N may support 0.5-1.5 Tmol C year(-1)
   of primary production, a small proportion of total Arctic Ocean
   photosynthesis. Rapid uptake of dissolved inorganic nitrogen coupled
   with relatively high rates of dissolved organic nitrogen regeneration in
   N-limited nearshore regions, however, leads to potential localized rates
   of riverine-supported photosynthesis that represent a substantial

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) can be strongly accumulated and biomagnified along aquatic

   freshwater fish, the tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, using Hg-203
   radiotracer technique. The dissolved uptake rates of both mercury
   species increased linearly with Hg concentration (tested at ng/L
   levels), and the uptake rate constant of MeHg was 4 times higher than
   that of Hg(II). Dissolved uptake of mercury was highly dependent on the
   water pH and dissolved organic carbon concentration. The dietborne
   assimilation efficiency of MeHg was 3.7-7.2 times higher than that of
   Hg(II), while the efflux rate constant of MeHg was 7.1 times lower. The
   biokinetic modeling results showed that MeHg was the greater contributor
   to the overall mercury bioaccumulation and dietary exposure was the

Abstract = {{We determined patterns of benthic metabolism and examined the relative
   importance of denitrification (DNF) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction
   to ammonium (DNRA) as sinks for nitrate (NO3-) in intertidal sediments
   in the presence and absence of benthic microalgal (BMA) activity. By
   influencing the activity of BMA, light regulated the metabolic status of
   the sediments, and, in turn, exerted strong control on sediment nitrogen
   dynamics and the fate of inorganic nitrogen. A pulsed addition of
   N-15-labeled NO tracked the effect and fate of dissolved inorganic
   nitrogen (DIN) in the system. Under illuminated conditions, BMA
   communities influenced benthic fluxes directly, via DIN uptake, and
   indirectly, by altering the oxygen penetration depth. Under dark hypoxic
   and anoxic conditions, the fate of water column NO3- was determined
   largely by three competing dissimilatory reductive processes; DNF, DNRA,
   and, on one occasion, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Mass
   balance of the added N-15 tracer illustrated that DNF accounted for a
   maximum of 48.2\% of the (NO3-)-N-15 reduced while DNRA (a minimum of
   11.4\%) and anammox (a minimum of 2.2\%) accounted for much less. A
   slurry experiment was employed to further examine the partitioning
   between DNF and DNRA. High sulfide concentrations negatively impacted
   rates of both processes, while high DOC:NO3- ratios favored DNRA over
   DNF. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{693-705}},
Abstract = {{The chemical and biological characteristics of the surface microlayer
   were determined during a transect across the South Pacific Ocean in
   October-December 2004. Concentrations of particulate organic carbon (1.3
   to 7.6-fold) and nitrogen (1.4 to 7-fold), and POC:PON ratios were
   consistently higher in the surface microlayer as compared to surface
   waters ( 5 m). The large variability in particulate organic matter
   enrichment was negatively correlated to wind speed. No enhanced
   concentrations of dissolved organic carbon were detectable in the
   surface microlayer as compared to 5 m, but chromophoric dissolved
   organic matter was markedly enriched ( by 2 to 4-fold) at all sites.
   Based on pigment analysis and cell counts, no consistent enrichment of
   any of the major components of the autotrophic and heterotrophic
   microbial community was detectable. CE-SSCP fingerprints and CARD FISH
   revealed that the bacterial communities present in the surface
   microlayer had close similarity (> 76\%) to those in surface waters. By
   contrast, bacterial heterotrophic production (H-3-leucine incorporation)
   was consistently lower in the surface microlayer than in surface waters.
   By applying CARD-FISH and microautoradiography, we observed that
   Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria dominated leucine uptake in the
   surface microlayer, while in surface waters Bacteroidetes and
   Alphaproteobacteria were the major groups accounting for leucine
   incorporation. Our results demonstrate that the microbial community in
   the surface microlayer closely resembles that of the surface waters of
   the open ocean. Even a short residence in the surface microlayer
   influences leucine incorporation by different bacterial groups, probably
   as a response to the differences in the physical and chemical nature of
   the two layers.}},

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{282}},
Pages = {{59-72}},
Abstract = {{Seagrasses play a variety of important ecological roles in coastal
   ecosystems. Here we present evidence that seagrass detritus from the
   widespread species Thalassia testudinum is an important source of ocean
   color and a UV-protective substance in a low latitude coastal shelf
   region of the United States. The production and light-induced
   degradation of chromophoric (sunlight-absorbing) dissolved organic
   matter (CDOM) from T testudinum was examined under field and controlled
   laboratory conditions to obtain data that could be used to estimate the
   contribution of seagrass-derived CDOM to the coastal pool. The
   laboratory studies measured the temperature dependence and
   photodegradation of the spectral (UV-visible, fluorescence) and
   molecular mass properties of CDOM produced during the degradation of T
   testudinum detritus, The rate of CDOM production is
   temperature-dependent with rates doubling when temperature increases
   from 21.4 to 32.6degreesC. The magnitude of this increase is close to
   the widely observed Q(10) factor for microbial decomposition, indicating
   that the CDOM production was likely microbially mediated. The absorption
   coefficients and fluorescence of CDOM from T testudinum decreased on
   exposure to solar UV radiation (UVR) and the wavelength dependence was
   determined for this photobleaching process.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on links of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), inorganic
   nutrients (DIN and DIP) and bacterioplankton growth with specific coral
   reef water types. At 5 reef stations along the SW coast of Curacao
   (Netherlands Antilles), 6 different water types (4 reef water types
   {[}live coral surface contact water, reef crevice water, reef bottom
   water, reef overlying water] and 2 reference water types collected
   offshore from each station at 2 and 8 m depth! were analysed for DOG,
   DIN and DIP, bacterial production and abundance. Consistent patterns
   were found: reef waters were enhanced in DIN, DIP and specific bacterial
   growth rate (mu (n)) compared to offshore waters. DOG, DIP, and mu (n)
   were higher close to the reef bottom than in the reef overlying water.
   Coral surface contact water was significantly enhanced in DOC compared
   to reef crevice and reef bottom water. suggesting that the major source
   of DOC in reef waters are the Live corals. DIN concentration was highest
   in reef crevice water, suggesting that crevices are the major net
   N-regenerating spaces on reefs, more important than the reef bottom
   between corals. Small-scale DIP distribution suggested net P
   regeneration in reef crevice and coral surface contact water. The
   highest specific growth rates of bacterioplankton were found in the
   coral surface contact water, with slightly lower rates in reef crevice
   water. Experiments showed that the labile DOC fraction (LDOC) in reef
   crevice water was substantially smaller than in coral surface contact
   and reef overlying water, which suggests that crevices are apparently
   sinks of LDOC. In reef crevice and reef bottom water the low substrate
   LDOC:DIN ratios suggest that LDOC might be the growth-limiting factor of
   bacterioplankton in these water types. In coral surface contact and reef
   overlying water the substrate LDOC:DIN ratios of more than 40 land
   LDOC:DIP ratios of over 800) and the significant relations between mu
   (n) and DIN (DIP) suggest nutrient limitation of bacterioplankton growth
   in these water types. This study clearly illustrates the close link in
   reef waters between coral reef benthos and bacterioplankton
   trophodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Solar radiation causes considerable photochemical effects on dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) from both fresh and marine waters. Photooxidation
   of DOM to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) has been shown to be a
   quantitatively significant process in the turnover of DOM. Less is known
   about photodegradation of particulate organic matter, e.g., plant
   detritus. We have evaluated direct and indirect (via photooxidation of
   DOM released from plant detritus) photooxidative inorganic-carbon
   production from detritus of the emergent macrophytes Phragmites
   australis, Typha angustifolia, and Juncus sp. Macrophyte leaves were
   sterilized and incubated in quartz tubes under three radiation regimes:
   darkness, ultraviolet (UV)-A, and UV-A + UV-B radiation, using
   fluorescent lamps with radiation intensities and spectral composition of
   UV-B and UV-A radiation similar to those of natural solar radiation.
   Inorganic carbon production was investigated with leaves both immersed
   in water and in the air.
   Photoproduction of DIC in both water and air was linear over lime (72
   h). Production of DIC ranged from 0.22 to 0.44 mu g C.(mg dry
   mass)(-1).(24 h)(-1). Experiments with macrophyte leachate, excluding
   the particulate matter (POM), indicated that similar to 56\% of the DIC
   accumulating in the water originated from DOM leached from the plant
   detritus, while 44\% of DIC production originated directly from POM.
   Carbon dioxide released from leaves incubated in air and exposed to UV
   radiation was lower than for leaves immersed in water (values including
   DIC produced from leachate). In most cases, DIC production with only
   UV-A radiation ranged between 60\% and 75\% of the values found in the
   UV-A + UV-B treatments, even though the artificial radiation was
   deficient in UV-A compared to solar radiation. Similar experiments,
   using natural solar radiation, indicated that PAR (photosynthetically
   active radiation) has a major effect on DIC production. This shows that
   wavelength bands other than UV-B can play a significant role in
   photodegradation of organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{Potential hydrolysis rates of three different polysaccharides, pullulan,
   laminarin, and xylan, were measured in intact sediment cores from Cape
   Lookout Eight, North Carolina, in order to constrain the rates at which
   a fraction of the high-molecular-weight sedimentary carbon pool may be
   hydrolyzed to lower molecular weights. Potential hydrolysis rates of
   pullulan were somewhat higher than those of laminarin and xylan. Highest
   potential rates were measured in surface sediments; rates at depths of
   5-7 and 14-16 cm differed relatively little from one another. Total
   dissolved carbohydrates, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), sulfate, and
   sulfate reduction rates were also measured and compared with data
   previously collected at Cape Lookout Eight in order to investigate
   carbohydrate dynamics and establish the relative contribution of
   carbohydrates to the sedimentary carbon budget. Total porewater
   carbohydrates constitute a disproportionate fraction of DOC, ranging
   from a maximum of 855 in near-surface intervals to 24\% at depths of
   14-16 cm. A comparison of potential hydrolysis rates, dissolved
   carbohydrate concentrations, DOG, and sulfate reduction rates, along
   with results from a wide range of studies previously conducted at this
   site suggests that hydrolysis of high-molecular-weight polysaccharides
   can potentially be very rapid relative to carbon remineralization rates.
   Dissolved porewater carbohydrates form a dynamic pool that is likely
   turned over on short timescales in Cape Lookout Bight sediments.

   15 nM in the marine end-member, and the ACSV-non-labile fraction,
   comprising Ni complexes whose alpha coefficients exceed 10(9.2),
   contributed between about 15 and 60\% of the total dissolved pool. The
   axial distributions of total dissolved Ni and species thereof, and
   dissolved organic carbon, could be defined in terms of simple end-member
   mixing, suggesting little biogeochemical reactivity in the estuary.
   Particulate Ni was dominated (greater than or equal to 70\%) by the
   fraction available to acetic acid, and a distinct seaward decrease from
   about 35 to 2 mu g g(-1) could, likewise, be largely accounted for by
   mixing of (particle) end-members of different composition. The uptake of
   Ni by Beaulieu particles was monitored in a series of laboratory
   simulations employing Ni-63 and liquid scintillation counting.
   Adsorption was dependent to some degree on salinity, pH and particle
   type, but most importantly on the presence of dissolved organic matter.
   Thus, particle-water distribution coefficients (K(D)s) were almost
   doubled when artificial river and sea waters, containing no pre-existing
   dissolved organic matter, were used in place of organic-rich Beaulieu
   end-members, and increased by seven-fold when UV-irradiated river water
   was used in place of untreated river water. These observations were
   interpreted in terms of the formation of small (sub-colloidal) and
   relatively strong organic complexes which are relatively resistant to
   adsorption, and a simple model was developed, incorporating the K(D)s,
   to predict the ratio of this fraction of dissolved Ni to the remaining
   fraction of dissolved Ni as a function of suspended particle
   concentration. The ACSV (field) measurements of labile and non-labile
   dissolved Ni from the Beaulieu conformed with the model prediction when
   K(D)s for UV-irradiated and untreated river waters were employed,
   implying that the ACSV-non-labile fraction of dissolved Ni (log(10)alpha
   > 9.2) affords a good indication of the fraction which is resistant to
   adsorption. It is suggested that the low biogeochemical reactivity of Ni
   in the Beaulieu results from a combination of its low particle affinity,
   maintained by the presence of specific dissolved organic ligands, and
   small suspended sediment fluxes throughout the estuary. The
   distributions of Ni in other estuaries are examined and implications for
   the more general estuarine behaviour of Ni are discussed. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{In order to test the hypothesis that bacterial membrane protein is more
   slowly degraded than soluble protein in seawater, we examined
   degradation by natural bacterioplankton of membrane and soluble proteins
   prepared from the marine bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus radiolabeled
   with (3)H- or (14)C-leucine. First order kinetic constants indicated
   that proteins in crude membrane extract are degraded at significantly
   slower rates (1/2 to 1/6) than the soluble proteins. Proteins determined
   to be intimately associated with the membrane were not degraded during
   the initial 45 hi while a substantial fraction of soluble proteins was
   degraded during the same period. The data are consistent with a model in
   which membrane and cell wall materials severely restrict access of
   bacterial proteases to membrane proteins. After prolonged incubation,
   however, membrane proteins started to be degraded, suggesting that
   proteins protected by membrane components were made available for
   degradation after ectoenzymatic destruction of membrane components. Our
   data support the hypothesis that macromolecular organic complexes play a
   role in temporary storage of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seawater
   and that complementary hydrolysis by different ectoenzymes produced by
   diverse bacterioplankton is important in determining rates and patterns
   of DOM degradation in the sea.}},

Abstract = {{Two strains of Dunaliella salina (Dunal) Teod., UTEX 1644 and UTEX 200,
   were cultured under different growth regimes, including 10 mM NO3- or
   NH4+, 1.5 or 3.0 M NaCl, and low (0.035\%) or high (5\%) CO2 in air. The
   release of C-14-labeled dissolved organic carbon (DOC), expressed as a
   rate and as a percentage of photo synthetic (CO2)-C-14, assimilation,
   was subsequently determined. The percentage of DOC released was
   inversely related to cell density in the assay medium, but
   photosynthesis on a per-cell basis was not. Release of DOC was low, in
   the range of 1-5\% of photosynthesis, but during acclimation to growth
   on NH4+, it rose to 11\%. The presence of NH4+ rather than NO3- in the
   growth medium increased the rate of release by both strains, but the
   percentage release was stimulated only in UTEX 200 cells, because their
   photosynthetic ra te was depressed by NH4+. For UTEX 1644, high, as
   compared to low, CO2-grown cells, had somewhat higher rates a nd
   percentages of DOC release, but release from UTEX 200 cells was
   unaffected by the growth-CO2. The rate of DOC release by high CO2-grown
   cells was not enhanced at a low concentration of dissolved inorganic
   carbon, indicating that the released material did not originate from the
   photorespiratory pathway. The effects of NaCl on DOC release varied with
   strain a nd growth conditions. For UTEX 200, the cells in NO3-, but not
   NH4+, exhibited a doubling or more in percentage Of release with a
   doubling in NaCl concentration, irrespective of growth-CO2. With UTEX
   1644 the low CO2-grown cells showed the greatest enhancement in 3.0 M
   NaCl. Organic matter accumulated on the external surface of the cell
   membrane and constituted a well-defined cell-coat, which was more dense
   in NH4+ than in NO3--grown cells. Microtubules, which may play a role in
   maintaining cell shape, were observed just below the plasma membrane.
   From a practical viewpoint, the presence of organic material in the
   hypersaline ponds of salt-works is detrimental to salt production. When
   D. salina cells become abundant in such ponds, the attendant, continuous
   release of DOC may make a significant contribution to the problem.}},

Abstract = {{The production mechanism of light nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC) in
   seawater was investigated during the North Atlantic atmospheric
   chemistry program (NATAC) in April and May 1991 in the European coastal
   seas and the North Atlantic. A significant alkene production occurred in
   the presence of light only. Under conditions of negligible NMHC
   emissions (low wind velocity) increasing hydrocarbon concentrations were
   observed during daytime, whereas the concentrations remained constant
   during night. NMHC formation experiments were carried out with seawater
   filled in quartz glass bottles and showed the same dependence of light.
   Experiments with differently pretreated seawater samples indicated that
   the presence of dissolved organic material (DOM) is also necessary for
   alkene production. We suggest a two-step production mechanism for
   alkenes: first DOM is released, probably from algae, then part of this
   material is photochemically transformed into alkenes. The production
   rates in the quartz glass bottles were comparable to the production
   rates in the ocean surface. This indicates that the processes occurring
   in the experimental setups represent the processes occurring in the
   field. Since the production - and emission rates were in the same range
   it can be concluded that the budget of light alkenes in the remote
   marine environment is determined by the production in seawater as the
   dominant source and the flux into the atmosphere as the main loss
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Microzonation of denitrification in trickling filter biofilms was
   studied using a combined microsensor for O2 and N2O. Denitrification was
   measured as a function of concentrations of O2, NO3-, organic matter and
   NH4+ and was found to occur only in part of the biofilm. At increased
   concentrations of NO3- the thickness of the denitrifying zone increased
   and thereby increased the total denitrification whereas addition of
   dissolved organic matter increased the rates of denitrification within
   the denitrifying part of the biofilm, expressed per volume biofilm. The
   presence of NH4+ decreased the rate of NO3- assimilation and thereby
   increased the availability of NO3- for denitrification. Denitrification
   was only found at O2 concentrations below approximately 20 muM. The oxic
   zone normally extended 0.2-0.3 mm below the biofilm surface, but when
   the biofilm was exposed to light photosynthetically produced O2 pushed
   the oxic-anoxic interface down to 1.3 mm. Denitrification stopped when
   O2 was introduced to the denitrifying zone, but even after exposure to
   O2 for 18 h denitrification began immediately after returning to anoxic
   conditions. Steady state in denitrification was then reached in only 30
   min and the rate found then was identical to the rate before exposure to
   O2, as well as the rate 15 h after return to anoxia. The immediate onset
   of denitrification suggests that most of the denitrifiers in the biofilm
   possessed constitutive enzyme systems for denitrification.}},

Abstract = {{Despite considerable research on the linkages between dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) and bacteria, it is not yet clear how the abundance of the
   main aquatic clades relates to DOM composition in natural aquatic
   systems. We evaluated this relation using PARAFAC modeling of
   excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy and spectroscopic indexes
   to characterize DOM composition, and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
   to quantify the major bacterial groups in a subtropical lagoon. The DOM
   exhibited marked temporal variations in concentration, molecular weight,
   aromaticity, color, degree of humification, and freshness, and
   proportion of the three different fluorescent components identified. All
   major bacterial clades (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria,
   Gammaproteobacteria, and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria) were significantly
   linked to DOM concentration and/or composition, being those crucial
   factors for modeling their abundance in situ. The combination and
   significance of the factors was specific for each bacterial group,
   strongly indicating that they behave as coherent and distinctive units.
   Cytophaga-Flavobacteria and Betaproteobacteria were the groups which
   correlated with more DOM properties. Alphaproteobacteria and
   Gammaproteobacteria abundances were significantly explained by low or
   high dissolved organic carbon concentrations, respectively. The
   significant relationships between DOM properties and the main bacterial
   groups delineated a profile of each group regarding DOM
   preferences/dislikes, in agreement with evidence derived from genome
   analysis to single-cell substrate uptake. These results highlight the
   specificities of the main bacterial clades, providing support for a
   functional classification of the bacterioplankton regarding DOM
   processing at the level of bacterial classes.}},

Abstract = {{The bacterial degradation of polysaccharides is central to marine carbon
   cycling, but little is known about the bacterial taxa that degrade
   specific marine polysaccharides. Here, bacterial growth and community
   dynamics were studied during the degradation of the polysaccharides
   chitin, alginate and agarose in microcosm experiments at four
   contrasting locations in the Southern and Atlantic Oceans. At the
   Southern polar front, chitin-supplemented microcosms were characterized
   by higher fractions of actively growing cells and a community shift from
   Alphaproteobacteria to Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. At the
   Antarctic ice shelf, chitin degradation was associated with growth of
   Bacteroidetes, with 24\% higher cell numbers compared with the control.
   At the Patagonian continental shelf, alginate and agarose degradation
   covaried with growth of different Alteromonadaceae populations, each
   with specific temporal growth patterns. At the Mauritanian upwelling,
   only the alginate hydrolysis product guluronate was consumed, coincident
   with increasing abundances of Alteromonadaceae and possibly
   cross-feeding SAR11. 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries indicated that
   growth of the Bacteroidetes-affiliated genus Reichenbachiella was
   stimulated by chitin at all cold and temperate water stations,
   suggesting comparable ecological roles over wide geographical scales.
   Overall, the predominance of location-specific patterns showed that
   bacterial communities from contrasting oceanic biomes have members with
   different potentials to hydrolyse polysaccharides.}},

Abstract = {{Photosynthesis and respiration determine the carbon and oxygen (O-2)
   balance of ecosystems. Current methods used to estimate ecosystem
   respiration (ER) do not include diel ER fluctuations, which limit
   testing predictions about short-term drivers of ecosystem metabolism.
   Diel changes in delta O-18(O2) can be used to estimate diel ER due to
   discrimination against O-18(O2) during respiration. We monitored diel
   delta O-18(O2), O-2, light, and water temperature in three Wyoming
   streams and measured respiration fractionation (alpha(R)) against
   O-18(O2) in dark benthic flow chambers in two streams. The ranges of
   measured and literature alpha(R) values were used to estimate
   uncertainty in metabolism parameters associated with not measuring
   alpha(R) directly. Daytime ER was 54-340\% higher than nighttime ER
   using delta O-18(O2), but diel ER parameter estimates were highly
   uncertain relative to traditional estimates of ecosystem metabolism.
   Diel variations in water temperature only accounted for 4-55\% of the
   range of diel ER calculated using diel delta O-18(O2). Measured benthic
   flow chamber alpha(R) varied within the range of literature values: from
   0.9755 to 0.9954. Metabolism parameter estimates were very sensitive to
   choice of alpha(R) within the measured and published range of values.
   The mean and uncertainty of diel ER estimates increased with decreasing
   alpha(R), with daily ER more than ten times higher given an alpha(R) of
   0.975 vs. 0.999. Diel changes in ER can be modeled using delta O-18(O2)
   and O-2, but diel ER estimates depend on the choice of alpha(R),
   suggesting the need to better understand how alpha(R) may vary within
   spatial and temporal scales appropriate for delta O-18(O2) metabolism
   models.}},

Title = {{Proteomic and Transcriptomic Analyses of ``Candidatus Pelagibacter
   ubique{''} Describe the First P-II-Independent Response to Nitrogen
   Limitation in a Free-Living Alphaproteobacterium}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nitrogen is one of the major nutrients limiting microbial productivity
   in the ocean, and as a result, most marine microorganisms have evolved
   systems for responding to nitrogen stress. The highly abundant
   alphaproteobacterium ``Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique,{''} a cultured
   member of the order Pelagibacterales (SAR11), lacks the canonical GlnB,
   GlnD, GlnK, and NtrB/NtrC genes for regulating nitrogen assimilation,
   raising questions about how these organisms respond to nitrogen
   limitation. A survey of 266 Alphaproteobacteria genomes found these five
   regulatory genes nearly universally conserved, absent only in
   intracellular parasites and members of the order Pelagibacterales,
   including ``Ca. Pelagibacter ubique.{''} Global differences in mRNA and
   protein expression between nitrogen-limited and nitrogen-replete
   cultures were measured to identify nitrogen stress responses in ``Ca.
   Pelagibacter ubique{''} strain HTCC1062. Transporters for ammonium
   (AmtB), taurine (TauA), amino acids (YhdW), and opines (OccT) were all
   elevated in nitrogen-limited cells, indicating that they devote
   increased resources to the assimilation of nitrogenous organic
   compounds. Enzymes for assimilating amine into glutamine (GlnA),
   glutamate (GltBD), and glycine (AspC) were similarly upregulated.
   Differential regulation of the transcriptional regulator NtrX in the
   two-component signaling system NtrY/NtrX was also observed, implicating
   it in control of the nitrogen starvation response. Comparisons of the
   transcriptome and proteome supported previous observations of uncoupling
   between transcription and translation in nutrient-deprived ``Ca.
   Pelagibacter ubique{''} cells. Overall, these data reveal a streamlined,
   P-II-independent response to nitrogen stress in ``Ca. Pelagibacter
   ubique,{''} and likely other Pelagibacterales, and show that they
   respond to nitrogen stress by allocating more resources to the
   assimilation of nitrogen-rich organic compounds.
   IMPORTANCE Pelagibacterales are extraordinarily abundant and play a
   pivotal role in marine geochemical cycles, as one of the major recyclers
   of labile dissolved organic matter. They are also models for
   understanding how streamlining selection can reshape chemoheterotroph
   metabolism. Streamlining and its broad importance to environmental
   microbiology are emerging slowly from studies that reveal the complete
   genomes of uncultured organisms. Here, we report another remarkable
   example of streamlined metabolism in Pelagibacterales, this time in
   systems that control nitrogen assimilation. Pelagibacterales are major
   contributors to metatranscriptomes and metaproteomes from ocean systems,
   where patterns of gene expression are used to gain insight into ocean
   conditions and geochemical cycles. The data presented here supply
   background that is essential to interpreting data from field studies.}},

Abstract = {{Deep-water nutrient injection in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre
   provides an aperiodic yet significant source of inorganic nutrients to
   the nutrient-limiting surface waters, and has been implicated in
   phytoplankton bloom formation. Here we examined short-term
   transcriptional responses of surface water picoplankton assemblages in a
   deep-sea water (DSW) mixing experiment. Both flow cytometric and
   transcriptomic analysis indicated stimulation of an Alteromonas-like
   population in the DSW-amended treatment after 12 h, relative to the
   control. Among the highly expressed alteromonad transcripts in
   DSW-treated samples, those encoding genes associated with chemotaxis,
   cell motility and carbon metabolism were most highly represented,
   relative to the control. Similarly, Prochlorococcus showed significantly
   higher levels of transcripts associated with carbon fixation and
   photosynthesis, as well as slightly increased cell density, relative to
   the control. Although other microbial taxa did not exhibit enhanced
   growth, DSW-stimulated changes in their genome-wide transcriptional
   profiles were still readily detectable. Cell-associated cyanophage DNA
   and cDNA profiles suggested DSW stimulation of phage-mediated cell
   lysis, in previously infected cells. Comparison of the DSW-responsive
   Alteromonas populations, to previously reported dissolved organic matter
   (DOM)-responding alteromonads (McCarren et al., 2010), revealed
   differential transcript abundances, predominantly among genes encoding
   mobile elements and phage-related genes. Transcript representation in
   other metabolic pathways differed significantly between Alteromonas
   populations in the two different treatments, suggesting
   perturbation-specific metabolic responses to DSW and DOM. In total, the
   results provide new insight into short-term responses of picoplankton to
   DSW mixing, which occur prior to the more well-studied, longer-term
   growth responses of larger phytoplankton species.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{13}},

Abstract = {{This study shows that light exposure of flocculent material (floc) from
   the Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) results in significant dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) generation through photo-dissolution processes.
   Floc was collected at two sites along the Shark River Slough (SRS) and
   irradiated with artificial sunlight. The DOM generated was characterized
   using elemental analysis and excitation emission matrix fluorescence
   coupled with parallel factor analysis. To investigate the seasonal
   variations of DOM photo-generation from floc, this experiment was
   performed in typical dry (April) and wet (October) seasons for the FCE.
   Our results show that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for samples
   incubated under dark conditions displayed a relatively small increase,
   suggesting that microbial processes and/or leaching might be minor
   processes in comparison to photo-dissolution for the generation of DOM
   from floc. On the other hand, DOC increased substantially (as much as
   259 mgC gC(-1)) for samples exposed to artificial sunlight, indicating
   the release of DOM through photo-induced alterations of floc. The
   fluorescence intensity of both humic-like and protein-like components
   also increased with light exposure. Terrestrial humic-like components
   were found to be the main contributors (up to 70\%) to the chromophoric
   DOM (CDOM) pool, while protein-like components comprised a relatively
   small percentage (up to 16\%) of the total CDOM. Simultaneously to the
   generation of DOC, both total dissolved nitrogen and soluble reactive
   phosphorus also increased substantially during the photo-incubation
   period. Thus, the photo-dissolution of floc can be an important source
   of DOM to the FCE environment, with the potential to influence nutrient
   dynamics in this system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eutrophication causes seasonally anoxic bottom waters in coastal
   environments, but we lack information on effects of onset of anoxia and
   subsequent reoxygenation on benthic fluxes of redox-sensitive minerals
   and associated organic carbon (OC). As the first study, we determined
   the effect of inducing anoxia and subsequently restoring oxic conditions
   in mesocosms with surface sediment and water from a coastal environment.
   These concentration changes were compared with those in an oxygenated
   control. We determined water column concentrations of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), iron, manganese, and
   phosphate.
   Benthic fluxes of DOC, POC, and iron increased at the onset of anoxia in
   oxygen-depleted treatments. DOC and iron concentrations increased
   concomitantly towards maxima, which may have indicated reductive
   dissolution of FeOOH and release of associated OC. The subsequent
   concomitant concentration decreases may have been the result of
   coprecipitation of OC with iron-containing minerals. In contrast, the
   phosphate-concentration increase occurred several days after the onset
   of anoxia and the manganese concentration was not affected by the onset
   of anoxia. Restoring oxic conditions resulted in a decrease in DOC, POC,
   and phosphate concentrations, which may indicate coprecipitation of OC
   with phosphate-containing minerals. The high DOC fluxes at the onset of
   anoxia indicate that redox oscillations may be important in OC
   degradation. Further, our results indicate a close coupling between OC
   cycling and dissolution/precipitation of iron-containing minerals in
   intermittently anoxic sediments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To determine chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) sources in
   Southern California coastal waters, optical properties of a river outlet
   and adjacent tidally flushed salt marshes were monitored (dry season;
   June July 2001). Average absorption coefficients doubled at ebb vs.
   flood tides (4.8 +/- 1.5 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.9 m(-1); 300 nm), suggesting
   significant salt marsh CDOM inputs into coastal waters. Average spectral
   slopes were not statistically different for any sites or tides (0.010
   +/- 0.002 nm(-1)), consistent with salt marsh CDOM dominating coastal
   waters. Three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrices
   (EEMs) at ebb tide showed contributions from terrestrial, protein, and
   marine humic-like peaks, suggesting production and output of these
   materials from the marsh. A marine humic signal at the river outlet
   during an offshore upwelling event indicated an additional sporadic
   nonmarsh marine humic-like source. EEMs of six common salt marsh plant
   leachates showed protein, terrestrial, and marine humic-like peaks. To
   estimate CDOM photodegradation in the marsh, fluorescence intensity
   decays from photobleaching experiments were fit to first-order kinetics.
   Most humic peaks degraded with a half-life of t(1/2) = 10-20 h, which
   overlaps the estimated residence time of water in the marshes (similar
   to 12 h). Most protein peaks were resistant to photodegradation,
   suggesting that the low levels of protein vs. humic-like material
   measured in natural waters was due to rapid bioutilization of
   proteinaceous material. The rapid photodegradation of plant leachate
   humic material and the low spectral slopes for the field sites suggest
   that marsh sediments would be an important source of CDOM.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial and photochemical processes affect chromophoric dissolved
   organic matter (CDOM) dynamics in the ocean. Some evidence suggests that
   dissolved nitrogen plays a role in CDOM formation, although this has
   received little systematic attention in marine ecosystems. Coastal
   seawater incubations were carried out in the presence of model dissolved
   organic nitrogen (DON: amino sugars and amino acids) and dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (DIN) compounds to assess their role in biological
   and photochemical production of CDOM. For several of the dissolved N
   compounds, microbial processing resulted in a pulse of CDOM that was
   mainly labile, appearing and disappearing within 7 days. In contrast, a
   net loss of CDOM occurred when no N was added to the microbial
   incubations. The greatest net biological CDOM formation was found upon
   addition of amino sugars (formation of fluorescent, mostly labile CDOM)
   and tryptophan (formation of non-fluorescent, refractory CDOM).
   Photochemical formation of CDOM was only found with tryptophan, the one
   aromatic compound tested. This CDOM was highly fluorescent, with
   excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) resembling those of terrestrial,
   humic-like fluorophores. The heterogeneity in CDOM formation from this
   collection of labile N-containing compounds was surprising. These
   compounds are common components of biopolymers and humic substances in
   natural waters and likely to contribute to microbially- and
   photochemically-produced CDOM in coastal seawater. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{45}},

Pages = {{535-542}},
Abstract = {{Almost half of the global photosynthetic activity is carried out in the
   ocean. During blooms, Phaeocystis can fix CO2 at rates up to 40 g C
   m(-2) month(-1). Most of this carbon is released as polysaccharides.
   However, the cellular mechanism whereby this huge amount of organic
   material is exported into the seawater remains unknown. A vaguely
   defined process of ``exudation{''} is believed responsible for the
   release of these biopolymers. Here we report the first demonstration
   that Phaeocystis globosa does not ``exude{''}, but secretes microscopic
   gels. Secretion is stimulated by blue light (lambda = 470 +/- 20 nm),
   and it is transduced by a characteristic intracellular Ca2+ signal that
   precedes degranulation. The polysaccharides that form the matrix of
   these gels remain in condensed phase while stored in secretory vesicles.
   Upon exocytosis, the exopolymer matrix undergoes a characteristic phase
   transition accompanied by extensive swelling resulting in the formation
   of microscopic hydrated gels. Owing to their tangled topology, once
   released into the seawater, the polymers that make these gels can
   reptate (axially diffuse), interpenetrate neighboring gels, and anneal
   them together forming massive mucilage accumulations that are
   characteristic of Phaeocystis blooms. These gel masses can supply a rich
   source of microbial substrates, disperse in the seawater, and/or
   eventually sediment to the ocean floor.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption of organic matter from four species of phytoplankton to
   clean mineral surfaces was studied using sequential adsorption
   experiments. The soluble intracellular components from four.
   phytoplankton species, Phaeocystis globosa; Gymnodinium sanguineum,
   Scrippsiella trochoidea, and Ditylum brightwellii; were repeatedly
   exposed to three minerals; montmorillonite, kaolinite, and chlorite. The
   surface-reactive fraction of organic matter in phytoplankton dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) solutions ranged from 47\% to 85\% of the total.
   Adsorption partition coefficients (K-d) ranged from 53 to 175 1 kg(-1).
   These partition coefficients are significantly higher than the partition
   coefficients commonly observed for sedimentary porewater organic matter
   (less than or equal to 301 kg(-1)), and suggest that phytoplankton
   exudates contain a component of organic matter with considerable surface
   reactivity. S. trochoidea and D. brightwellii consistently had the
   highest Kd values and the greatest reactive organic matter component
   relative to P. globosa and G. sanguineum. On average, the highest K-d
   values were associated with chlorite (average K-d of 1191 kg(-1)) and
   montmorillonite (average of 1051 kg(-1)) rather than kaolinite (average
   K-d of 89 1 kg(-1)). Organic matter from all four phytoplankton species
   interacted most with montmorillonite (average= 82\% reactive), followed
   by chlorite (72\% reactive) and kaolinite (63\% reactive). Significant
   variation in both the extent of surface-reactive material and the
   partition coefficients of the reactive material using this matrix of
   source organisms and mineral surfaces suggest that both the mineral and
   organic matter sources are influential in the sorption of organic matter
   to sediment surfaces. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A study of total and particle-associated bacteria in the Northwest
   Mediterranean revealed notable relationships with depth. Cell-specific
   leucine incorporation rates by total bacteria decreased significantly
   with depth (to 380 m), best fitting the power function log (rate) =
   2.1-0.54 log (depth), r(2) = 0.57, P = <0.001. In contrast,
   cell-specific leucine incorporation rates by particle-associated
   bacteria increased with depth as described by the power function log
   (rate) = 0.4+0.84 log (depth), r(2) = 0.74, P = <0.01. We suggest that
   this relationship may reflect availability of usable dissolved organic
   matter (UDOM) and/or inorganic nutrients within the particle with
   increasing water depth. The latter relationship could also be
   interpreted in relation with time, i.e., be a consequence of the time
   taken for enzyme induction and solubilization of particulate organic
   matter (POM) to UDOM and the subsequent incorporation into bacterial
   protein during the sinking of the particle. These results may help to
   explain observations that sinking particles are rapidly decomposed
   between 100 and 500 m. Bacteria associated with particles in the
   Mediterranean contributed only 0.8-2.8\% of total bacterial numbers but
   contributed 3-12\% of total bacterial production in the upper 70 m.
   However, their contribution to total bacterial production in deeper
   waters was substantially higher (48\% at 380 m). The activity of
   attached bacteria is, therefore, important and varies with depth, and
   this may help to explain the particularly low particle flux and hence
   the impoverished benthic environment found in the deeper waters of the
   Mediterranean.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved and colloidal concentrations of Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb
   were determined in the Mullica River, New Jersey, and its tributaries on
   nine occasions between August 1994 and September 1995. Cross-flow
   filtration (CFF) at a nominal 10 kDa cutoff was used to separate total
   dissolved (<0.45 mu m) riverine metals into colloidal and truly
   dissolved fractions. Reproducibility tests on full procedural replicates
   demonstrated CFF's precision and indicated that temporal or spatial
   differences exceeding 10-15\% in colloidal fraction can be resolved
   using these techniques. For the whole data set, mean colloidal fractions
   of 0.45-mu m filtrates were 65\% for Al, 82\% for Fe, 29\% for Mn, 66\%
   for Cu, 31\% for Zn, 46\% for Cd, and 88\% for Pb. The magnitude of the
   colloidal fraction followed an elemental order that was largely
   consistent from site to site and among different sampling dates, despite
   large variations in total dissolved metal concentrations. The order was
   very similar to that observed previously in rivers of varying
   geochemical properties, suggesting that the degree of colloidal
   association is driven by a metal's affinity for humic materials and is
   relatively insensitive to other riverine properties such as pH,
   dissolved organic carbon, and suspended mass. The constancy of this
   elemental pattern in Pinelands streams suggests that the relative fates
   of metals during estuarine colloid flocculation may be predictable and
   temporally stable. Iron behavior was distinct from that of the other
   elements: colloidal Fe fraction was positively correlated with pH
   (range, 4.3-7.1) and the colloidal Fe/Al ratio showed clear seasonal
   variation. The other metals did not exhibit these behaviors, which
   suggests that their colloidal association was distinct from that of Fe.
   Colloidal metal/Al ratio for Fe, Pb, and Zn was clearly different from
   that of >0.45-mu m particles; that finding is consistent with the
   distinct compositions and sources for colloidal and particulate
   fractions. The distribution coefficient (K-d) for Pb was positively
   correlated with suspended particulate mass (<10-fold variation) over
   time at one representative site. This inverse particle concentration
   effect runs contrary to recent observations in other freshwater and
   marine systems and suggests that colloidal and particulate size
   fractions vary independently over the course of the year.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the principles that govern the assembly of microbial
   communities across earth's biomes is a major challenge in modern
   microbial ecology. This pursuit is complicated by the difficulties of
   mapping functional roles and interactions onto communities with immense
   taxonomic diversity and of identifying the scale at which microbes
   interact {[}1]. To address this challenge, here, we focused on the
   bacterial communities that colonize and degrade particulate organic
   matter in the ocean {[}2-4]. We show that the assembly of these
   communities can be simplified as a linear combination of functional
   modules. Using synthetic polysaccharide particles immersed in natural
   bacterioplankton assemblages {[}1, 5], we showed that successional
   particle colonization dynamics are driven by the interaction of two
   types of modules: a first type made of narrowly specialized primary
   degraders, whose dynamics are controlled by particle polysaccharide
   composition, and a second type containing substrate-independent taxa
   whose dynamics are controlled by interspecific interactions-in
   particular, cross-feeding via organic acids, amino acids, and other
   metabolic byproducts. We show that, as a consequence of this trophic
   structure, communities can assemble modularly-i.e., by a simple sum of
   substrate-specific primary degrader modules, one for each complex
   polysaccharide in the particle, connected to a single broad-niche range
   consumer module. Consistent with this model, a linear combination of the
   communities on single-polysaccharide particles accurately predicts
   community composition on mixed-polysaccharide particles. Our results
   suggest that the assembly of heterotrophic communities that degrade
   complex organic materials follows simple design principles that could be
   exploited to engineer heterotrophic microbiomes.}},

Title = {{Long-term changes in light scattering in Chesapeake Bay inferred from
   Secchi depth, light attenuation, and remote sensing measurements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the Secchi depth (Z(SD)) and the diffuse
   attenuation coefficient for photosynthetically active radiation
   (K-d(PAR)), and in particular the product of the two, Z(SD)center dot
   K-d(PAR), is governed primarily by the ratio of light scattering to
   absorption. We analyzed measurements of Z(SD) and K-d(PAR) at main stem
   stations in Chesapeake Bay and found that the Z(SD)center dot K-d(PAR)
   product has declined at rates varying from 0.020 to 0.033 yr(-1) over
   the 17 to 25 years of measurement, implying that there has been a
   long-term increase in the scattering-to-absorption ratio. Remote sensing
   reflectance at the green wavelength most relevant to Z(SD) and K-d(PAR)
   in these waters, R-rs(555), did not exhibit an increasing trend over the
   10 years of available measurements. To reconcile the observations we
   constructed a bio-optical model to calculate Z(SD), K-d(PAR),
   Z(SD)center dot K-d(PAR), and R-rs(555) as a function of light
   attenuating substances and their mass-specific absorption and scattering
   coefficients. When simulations were based exclusively on changes in
   concentrations of light attenuating substances, a declining trend in
   Z(SD)center dot K-d entailed an increasing trend in R-rs(555), contrary
   to observations. To simulate both decreasing Z(SD center dot)K(d)(PAR)
   and stationary R-rs(555), it was necessary to allow for a declining
   trend in the ratio of backscattering to total scattering. Within our
   simulations, this was accomplished by increasing the relative proportion
   of organic detritus with high mass-specific scattering and low
   backscattering ratio. An alternative explanation not explicitly modeled
   is an increasing tendency for the particulate matter to occur in large
   aggregates. Data to discriminate between these alternatives are not
   available.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and its
   relationships to physical and biogeochemical parameters in Antarctic sea
   ice and oceanic water have indicated that ice melt may both alter the
   spectral characteristics of CDOM in Antarctic surface waters and serve
   as a likely source of fresh autochthonous CDOM and labile DOC. Samples
   were collected from melted bulk sea ice, sea ice brines, surface gap
   layer waters, and seawater during three expeditions: one during the
   spring to summer and two during the winter to spring transition period.
   Variability in both physical (temperature and salinity) and
   biogeochemical parameters (dissolved and particulate organic carbon and
   nitrogen, as well as chlorophyll a) was observed during and between
   studies, but CDOM absorption coefficients measured at 375 nm (a(375))
   did not differ significantly. Distinct peaked absorption spectra were
   consistently observed for bulk ice, brine, and gap water, but were
   absent in the seawater samples. Correlation with the measured physical
   and biogeochemical parameters could not resolve the source of these
   peaks, but the shoulders and peaks observed between 260 and 280 nm and
   between 320 to 330 nm respectively, particularly in the samples taken
   from high light-exposed gap layer environment, suggest a possible link
   to aromatic and mycosporine-like amino acids. Sea ice CDOM
   susceptibility to photo-bleaching was demonstrated in an in situ 120
   hour exposure, during which we observed a loss in CDOM absorption of
   53\% at 280 nm, 58\% at 330 nm, and 30\% at 375 nm. No overall
   coincidental loss of DOC or DON was measured during the experimental
   period. A relationship between the spectral slope (S) and
   carbon-specific absorption (a{*}(375)) indicated that the
   characteristics of CDOM can be described by the mixing of two broad
   end-members; and aged material, present in brine and seawater samples
   characterised by highs values and low a{*}(375); and a fresh material,
   due to elevated in situ production, present in the bulk ice samples
   characterised by low S and high a{*}(375). The DOC data reported here
   have been used to estimate that approximately 8 Tg C yr(-1) (similar to
   11\% of annual sea ice algae primary production) may be exported to the
   surface ocean during seasonal sea ice melt in the form of DOC. (C) 2010

Title = {{Chemical and isotopic composition of high-molecular-weight dissolved

Number = {{3-4}},

Abstract = {{In order to examine the source and transformation of
   high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (HMW-DOM) in the mixing
   zone of the Mississippi River plume, HMW-DOM with sizes between 1 kDa
   and 0.2 mu m was collected along a salinity gradient using cross-flow
   ultrafiltration. Isolated OM samples were desalted, freeze-dried and
   characterized for elemental (C and N) and biochemical composition
   (proteins, carbohydrates and uronic acids), stable isotopic (delta C-13
   and delta N-15) and radiocarbon (Delta C-14) signatures, and relative
   molecular composition using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry. The organic carbon content of HMW-DOM samples ranged from
   31 to 36 wt.\%, indicating that isolated colloids are mostly organic in
   nature. Contents of N ranged from 1.9\% to 3.3\%, resulting in a C/N
   ratio of 19-20 at lower salinity stations with a strong influence by
   terrestrial DOM and 12-15 at higher salinity stations with more freshly
   photosynthesized marine DOM. While OC-normalized protein contents
   decreased with increasing salinity, both carbohydrate and uronic acid
   contents increased with increasing salinity. Variations of pyrograms
   demonstrated that the proportion of furfural (an indicator of
   polysaccharides) in HMW-DOM also increased with increasing salinity,
   while the proportion of phenols decreased with increasing salinity.
   Changes in carbohydrate, (acid) polysaccharide and phenol contents of
   HMW-DOM samples reflect the variation in DOM sources along the salinity
   gradient, with higher phenol and low polysaccharide contents in lower
   salinity areas but higher polysaccharide and low phenol contents in
   coastal waters. Values of delta C-13 increased from -25.24 parts per
   thousand at the Mississippi River fresh water end-member station to
   -21.86 parts per thousand at an offshore station in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Changes in stable isotope composition resemble the changes in molecular
   composition from freshwater to coastal waters. Values of delta N-15, on
   the other hand, varied little, from 3.5 parts per thousand to 4.9 parts
   per thousand without a consistent trend, indicating that delta N-15 is a
   less sensitive source tracer. Measured radiocarbon signatures (Delta
   C-14) expressed as apparent C-14 ages ranged from > modern at lower
   salinity stations to 400-800 y BP at coastal stations. Results of
   isotopic mass balance revealed that, in addition to end-member organic
   matter from river and marine sources, at least 10-25\% of the HMW-DOM
   could derive from reworked or regenerated DOM in the Mississippi River
   plume, most likely through sediment-water interactions and lateral
   transport. Thus, reworking processes are important in governing the
   chemical and isotopic composition of DOM in the estuarine mixing zone.

Abstract = {{In situ(14)C uptake (dawn to dusk) and fast repetition rate fluorometry
   (FRRF) measurements at nearly monthly intervals were compared at Station
   ALOHA (22 degrees 45'N, 158 degrees 00'W) between August 2002 and
   September 2003 in order to determine the feasibility of using FRRF
   profiling as a means for estimating primary production (PP). The FRRF
   and C-14 rates were significantly correlated (r(2)=0.906, P value <
   0.05, n=70) with slopes of 2.00 and 1.90 for chl a and light normalized
   data, respectively. However, the relationship between C-14- and
   FRRF-derived carbon fixation varied vertically and temporally. The FRRF:
   C-14 ratio was > 1.5 in near-surface water (5-25 m depth) and approached
   1.0 deeper in the euphotic zone. Vertical variations probably reflected
   the effect of different physiological processes (i.e. Mehler reaction,
   dark respiration, and excretion) on overall photoautotrophic
   respiration. In particular, the decrease in Mehler reaction rates with
   increasing water depth may have accounted for the decrease in difference
   between C-14 and FRRF measurements with depth. The influence of in situ
   light field variability in controlling the absorption cross-section of
   photosystem II (PSII) (sigma(PSII)') may also have been responsible for
   some of this difference. When compared with total community respiration
   (R), the derived light-driven photoautotrophic respiration (reported
   here as the difference between FRRF and C-14 measurements) represented
   approximately 50\% of R integrated over the euphotic zone. Our results
   show that FRRF and C-14 measurements were well correlated in
   oligotrophic waters but the exact relationship between the two processes
   varies both temporally and vertically, such that a unique relationship
   between these two techniques could not be derived from first-order
   principles.}},

Abstract = {{Central aspects of carbon and sulfur biogeochemistry were studied along
   a transect extending from an unvegetated mudflat into a Spartina anglica
   salt marsh. Conditions along the transect differed with respect to tidal
   elevation, sediment characteristics, vegetation coverage, and benthic
   macrofauna abundance. Dark sediment O-2 uptake and CO2 emission at the
   highly bioturbated mudflat were low and relatively unaffected by tidal
   coverage. Sulfate reduction accounted for 30-60\% of the daily CO2
   emission from the open mudflat sediment. Sediment O-2 uptake within the
   nonbioturbated and vegetated marsh was up to seven times higher during
   air exposure than during inundation, whereas the difference in CO2
   emissions always was less than a factor of 2. The contribution of
   sulfate reduction to CO2 production was low (<21\%) and decreased
   progressively with tidal elevation as a result of the oxidizing capacity
   of S. anglica roots in the vegetated marsh. The boundary between the
   mudflat and the retreating marsh is a unique environment. High
   near-surface pore-water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   above the marsh cliff and highly elevated total carbon dioxide (TCO2)
   pore-water concentrations at both sides of the cliff during air exposure
   coincided with extremely high TCO2 emissions and apparent respiratory
   quotients (up to 14) only below the marsh cliff during inundation. We
   propose that substantial seepage of DOC-poor and HCO3--rich pore water
   may have occurred from the elevated marsh to the unvegetated sediment
   below during low tide followed by massive release of HCO3- during high
   tide. Accordingly, sulfate reduction accounted for more than the TCO2
   release above the marsh cliff, but only for about 40\% below the cliff.
   Mineralization rates and pathways in salt-marsh sediments vary
   considerably on small spatial and temporal scales and are dependent on
   inundation frequency as well as the composition and distribution of
   flora and fauna.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of oxygen depletion in bottom waters on anaerobic microbial
   activity was studied in a marine sediment with phytoplanktonic detritus
   as the main organic matter source. Sulphate reduction rates, sediment
   metabolism, pore water pools of inorganic and organic carbon compounds
   and ammonium and particulate pools (organic matter and chlorophyll-a)
   were examined in intact sediment cores exposed to a simulated oxygen
   depletion event. Sulphate reduction was stimulated shortly (2 days) and
   attained rates that were up to 8 times higher. After the initial
   stimulation, sulphate reduction rates decreased to a level similar to
   oxic conditions, and the longer term effect (2 weeks) of oxygen
   depletion on sulphate reduction was minor. Chlorophyll a profiles and
   closed anoxic incubations showed that the organic matter in the surface
   layer was easy to degrade and sulphate reduction accounted for
   approximately half of the carbon oxidation in the field cores. The pore
   water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were high in the
   anoxic cores indicating a slower anaerobic mineralization of dissolved
   organic matter. The potential effects of enhanced pore water DOC during
   oxygen depletion events are discussed. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Attenuation of ultraviolet (UV)-radiation into the water column is
   highly correlated with the concentration of the dissolved organic matter
   (DOM). Thus UV penetrates deeper into marine waters than into freshwater
   systems. DOM is efficiently cleaved by solar surface radiation levels
   consuming more oxygen than bacterial metabolism. This photolytically
   cleaved DOM exhibits higher absorbance ratios (250/365 nm) than
   untreated DOM. Natural bacterioplankton reach higher abundance if
   inoculated in previously solar-exposed DOM than in untreated DOM; during
   bacterial growth the absorbance ratio declines steadily indicating the
   utilization of the photolytically cleaved DOM. On the other hand,
   bacterioplankton are greatly reduced in their activity if exposed to
   surface solar radiation levels. Photoenzymatic repair of DNA induced by
   W-A radiation, however, leads to an efficient recovery of bacterial
   activity once the UV-B stress is released. Turbulent mixing of the upper
   layers of the water column leads to a continuous alteration of the UV
   exposure regime. Close to the surface, bacteria and DOM are exposed to
   high levels of UV-B leading to a reduction in bacterial activity and to
   photolysis of DOM. Once mixed into deeper layers where W-B is
   attenuated, but sufficient UV-A is remaining to allow photoenzymatic
   repair, the photolytically cleaved DOM is efficiently taken up by
   bacterioplankton leading to even higher bacterial activity than prior to
   the exposure. Thus, the overall effect of UV on bacterioplankton is
   actually an enhancement of bacterial activity despite their lack of
   protective pigments.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption properties on the XAD-8 resin and adsorption behaviour at the
   mercury electrode surface of naturally present organic substances were
   studied in seawater samples and in a surface microlayer sample collected
   in the north Adriatic Sea, as well as in marine phytoplankton culture
   media. Fractionation of the complex mixture of organic substances into
   hydrophobic neutral, hydrophobic acid and hydrophilic components by
   sorption on the XAD-8 resin was followed by dissolved organic carbon
   (DOG) analysis and by adsorption measurements at the mercury electrode
   surface in influent and effluent solutions.
   Dissolved organic surface active substances (SAS) in seawater samples
   taken in June and September 1992 at different depths in the north
   Adriatic Sea possessed mostly hydrophilic properties at natural pH
   conditions, or conditionally hydrophobic nature in acidic medium.
   Strongly adsorbable hydrophobic basic and neutral substances were less
   abundant, which was also the case with the sea surface microlayer
   sample. Similarly, mixed phytoplankton culture medium containing
   predominantly diatoms showed a high content of hydrophilic organic
   substances (74.5\% and 52.9\% of total SAS, and 90.5\% and 56.1\% of
   DOG), while the content of hydrophobic basic and neutral substances was
   extremely low. In contrast, in the mixed phytoplankton culture media in
   which flagellates are the most abundant species, the predominance of
   hydrophobic basic and neutral SAS (44.4-48.7\%) was found, while
   hydrophobic acid and hydrophilic surface active substances contributed
   in the less extent (30.3-31.9\% and 21.0-23.7\%, respectively). The
   distribution of the fractions in the mixed-culture medium with
   flagellates, calculated from DOC analysis, is quite different, i.e.
   hydrophobic basic and neutral fraction contained lower amounts (21.1\%)
   of DOG, compared to the hydrophilic fraction with the highest amounts
   (70.4\%) of the total DOG. The hydrophobic acid compounds represented
   only 8.5\% of the DOC of the initial sample. The distribution of
   different fractions in the monocultures of flagellates and diatoms
   corresponds to the distribution obtained in the mixed-culture media,
   with the only exception that hydrophobic acid fraction in the diatom
   monoculture of Phaeodactilum tricornutum represented predominant surface
   active material (83.6\%).
   Seasonal variations of SAS and DOC values in the north Adriatic Sea in
   the period 1984-1993 were presented and discussed with regard to
   seasonal features of phytoplankton communities and their release
   products with different hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties.}},

Abstract = {{Reactions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with photochemically
   generated reactive halogen species (RHS) may represent an important
   natural source of organohalogens within surface seawaters. However,
   investigation of such processes has been limited by difficulties in
   quantifying low dissolved organohalogen concentrations in the presence
   of background inorganic halides. In this work, sequential solid phase
   extraction (SPE) and silver-form cation exchange filtration were
   utilized to desalt and preconcentrate seawater DOM prior to nonspecific
   organohalogen analysis by ICP-MS. Using this approach, native
   organobromine and organoiodine contents were found to range from 3.2-6.4
   X 10(-4) mol Br/mol C and 1.1-3.8 X 10(-4) mol I/mol C (or 19-160 nmol
   Br L-1 and 6-36 nmol I L-1) within a wide variety of natural seawater
   samples, compared with 0.6-1.2 X 10(-4) mol Br/mol C and 0.6-1.1 X
   10(-5) mol I/mol C in, I terrestrial natural organic matter (NOM)
   isolates. Together with a chemical probe method specific for RHS, the
   SPE+ICP-MS approach was also employed to demonstrate formation of
   nanomolar levels of organobromine and organoiodine during simulated and
   natural solar irradiation of DOM in artificial and natural seawaters. In
   a typical experiment, the organobromine content of 2.1 X 10(-4) mol C
   L-1 (2.5 mg C L-1) of Suwannee River NOM in artificial seawater
   increased by 69\% (from 5.9 X 10(-5) to 1.0 X 10(-4) mol Br/mol C)
   during exposure to 24 h of simulated sunlight. Increasing I-
   concentrations (up to 2.0 x 10(-7) mol L-1) promoted increases of up to
   460\% in organoiodine content (from 8.5 X 10(-6) to 4.8 X 10(-5) mol
   I/mol C) at the expense of organobromine formation under the same
   conditions. The results reported herein suggest that sunlight-driven
   reactions of RHS with DOM may play a significant role in marine bromine
   and iodine cycling.}},

Title = {{Carbon isotope records in a Mesoproterozoic epicratonic sea: Carbon
   cycling in a low-oxygen world}},
Journal = {{PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{228}},

Abstract = {{Carbon isotope profiles of sedimentary strata are widely used as both a
   tool for stratigraphic correlation and as a mechanism for inferring
   important changes in Earth's biogeochemical cycles. Chemostratigraphic
   interpretations, however, often rely on the assumption that the isotopic
   composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the surface oceans is
   broadly homogeneous. At times of globally high sea level, when
   epicratonic (epeiric) environments dominate our sedimentary record,
   carbon isotope records reveal substantial lateral variability. Here we
   investigate lateral variability in the marine carbon isotope record from
   pericratonic to epicratonic environments of the Mesoproterozoic (similar
   to 1.1 Ga) Atar/El Mreiti Groups of the Taoudeni Basin, West Africa.
   Restricted-marine epicratonic environments are consistently 2-4 parts
   per thousand lighter than open-marine pericratonic environments,
   suggesting input of an isotopically light carbon source that
   preferentially affected epicratonic environments. In contrast to
   epicratonic environments in the Paleozoic, where input of isotopically
   light carbon is generally attributed to input of terrestrial organic
   matter, we suggest that in situ remineralization of organic carbon via
   anaerobic microbial cycling drove observed isotopic variability. Within
   epicratonic El Mreiti Group strata, the extent of organic matter
   remineralization (and thus degree of C-13 depletion) is correlated with
   water depth, and associated with distinct differences in both total
   organic carbon (TOC) and pyrite concentration, suggesting a potential
   linkage to both the persistence of anoxia and the availability of
   sulfate within epicratonic environments. In such settings, the isotopic
   effects of organic carbon remineralization are potentially enhanced by
   either methane oxidation following methanogenic decomposition, or the
   intermittent oxidation of an enhanced dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   pool. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{How dissolved organic matter (DOM) undergoes chemical changes during its
   transit from river to ocean remains a challenge due to its complex
   structure. In this study, DOM along a river transect from black waters
   to marine waters is characterized using an offline combination of
   reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled
   to electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance
   mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS), as well as tandem ESI-FTICR-MS. In
   addition, a water extract from degraded wood that mainly consists of
   lignins is used for comparison to the DOM from this transect. The HPLC
   chromatograms of all DOM samples and the wood extract show two major
   well-separated components; one is hydrophilic and the other is
   hydrophobic, based on their elution order from the Cm column. From the
   FTICR-MS analysis of the HPLC fractions, the hydrophilic components
   mainly contain low molecular weight compounds (less than 400 Da), while
   the hydrophobic fractions contain the vast majority of compounds of the
   bulk Cm extracted DOM. The wood extract and the DOM samples from the
   transect of black waters to coastal marine waters show strikingly
   similar HPLC chromatograms, and the FTICR-MS analysis further indicates
   that a large fraction of molecular formulas from these samples are the
   same, existing as lignin-like compounds. Tandem mass spectrometry
   experiments show that several representative molecules from the
   lignin-like compounds have similar functional group losses and
   fragmentation patterns, consistent with modified lignin structural
   entities in the wood extract and these DOM samples. Taken together,
   these data suggest that lignin-derived compounds may survive the transit
   from the river to the coastal ocean and can accumulate there because of
   their refractory nature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved and particulate concentrations of the biogenic thiols cysteine
   (Cys), arginine-cysteine (Arg-Cys), glutamine-cysteine (Gin-Cys),
   gamma-glutamate-cysteine (gamma-Glu-Cys) and glutathione (GSH) were
   measured in the subartic Pacific Ocean in the summer of 2003 using high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with precolumn derivatization
   as reported in previous work. In this study, a preconcentration protocol
   for the derivatized thiols was utilized to extend detection limits of
   dissolved thiols to picomolar levels. The measured concentrations of
   particulate and dissolved thiols were uncoupled, with distinctive depth
   profiles and large differences in the particulate to dissolved ratios
   between individual compounds. Glutathione was the most abundant
   particulate thiol whereas the most abundant dissolved thiol was
   gamma-Glu-Cys, with concentrations as high as 15 nM. Given the
   relatively small pool of intracellular gamma-Glu-Cys and the very low
   dissolved concentrations of GSH, we hypothesize that glutathione
   released from cells is rapidly converted to the potentially degradation
   resistant gamma-Glu-Cys outside the cell. The relatively high
   concentrations of other dissolved thiols compared to particulate
   concentrations implies both biological exudation and slow degradation
   rates. Some thiols appear to vary with changes in nutrient availability
   but this effect is difficult to decouple from changes in community
   structure inferred from pigment analyses. Dissolved thiol concentrations
   also exceed typical metal concentrations in the subartic, Pacific,
   supporting previous arguments that they may be important in metal
   speciation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and activity of heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms
   were determined in the surface microlayer (SML) at marine and estuarine
   sites in the NW Mediterranean Sea from May to July 2003. At all study
   sites, community respiration in the SML exceeded that in the subsurface
   water (SSW) by factors between 1.7 and 28. The abundance of
   heterotrophic bacteria and the major groups of the autotrophic community
   displayed consistent, but low enrichment factors (EF) for the SML (mean
   1.3). In contrast, EF for the abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates
   and the concentration of particulate organic carbon were, on average, 4
   and 7, respectively. Community respiration rates in the SML were related
   to the concentration of total organic carbon; however, no relationship
   was detectable between community respiration and the abundance of the
   major groups of the heterotrophic and autotrophic community. Net
   community production, determined at 2 oligotrophic marine sites,
   displayed negative values for the SML, while in the SSW autotrophic
   processes balanced or exceeded heterotrophic processes. Similar rates of
   photochemical oxygen consumption were determined for the SML and the
   SSW. These results let us conclude that in situ primary production in
   the SML is not sufficient to support biological and photochemical
   mineralization at the air-water interface. We suggest that vertical
   transport of organic matter, mainly in colloidal and particulate form,
   to the air-water interface is the basis of the food web, thereby
   supporting net heterotrophy of the SML.}},

Abstract = {{Seawater samples were collected from the southeastern Bering Sea for
   determinations of dissolved (DOC, <0.7 mum), colloidal (COC, 1 kDa-0.7
   mum) and particulate organic carbon (POC, >0.7 mum), dissolved organic
   nitrogen (DON), particulate nitrogen (IN), and dissolved carbohydrate
   (DCHO) species, as well as stable isotopic composition (delta(13)C and
   delta(15)N) of suspended particulate organic matter (POM). DOC
   concentrations ranged from 61 to 92 muM (average 76+/-9 muM) with
   increasing concentrations from outer shelf to inner shelf along
   166degreesW. DOC concentrations were significantly inversely correlated
   with salinity, indicating that the DOC distribution was predominantly
   controlled by water mixing although primary production is the ultimate
   source of organic matter. DON concentrations averaged 6.4+/-0.9 muM,
   ranging from 4.3 to 8.4 muM, resulting in an average DOC/DON ratio of
   12+/-2 (ranging from 8 to 15). Total dissolved carbohydrates (TDCHO)
   comprised 13+/-3\% of bulk DOC, with 35+/-15\% of TDCHO in the
   polysaccharide and 65+/-15\% in the monosaccharide fractions. Suspended
   POM had an average C/N ratio of 7.4+/-1.1, significantly lower than the
   average DOC/DON ratio (12+/-2). There was a significant correlation
   between chlorophyll-a and POC concentrations. However, Ch1-a
   concentration was not closely coupled to DOC abundance. On average, POC
   comprised 14+/-5\% of the total organic carbon (TOC) pool in the water
   column, and COC comprised 34+/-8\% of the TOC, leaving 51+/-5\% of the
   TOC in the <1 kDa low-molecular-weight dissolved phase. Values of
   delta(13)C and delta(15)N in the suspended POM ranged from -27.1parts
   per thousand to -23.4parts per thousand (average -24.5+/-0.9parts per
   thousand) and from 2.8parts per thousand to 9.9parts per thousand
   (average 6.0+/-1.9parts per thousand), respectively. Interestingly,
   particulate delta(15)N values were negatively correlated with nitrate
   (NO3) concentrations at low NO3 concentrations (less than or equal to5
   muM) but positively correlated with NO3 concentrations when NO3
   concentrations were >5 muM, indicating the effects of nutrient drawdown
   in surface waters and diagenesis below the euphotic zone on the isotope
   fractionation. POM containing lighter C and N isotopes appeared to be
   decomposed preferentially during their transport from upper water column
   to bottom sediments. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Adhesion of three marine bacterial strains, i.e. Marinobacter

   surface was conditioned for 1 h with natural seawater collected at

   composition on the conditioning film and bacterial adhesion to it. The
   presence of a conditioning film was demonstrated by an increase in water
   contact angle from 15degrees on bare glass to 50degrees on the
   conditioned glass, concurrent with an increase in the amount of adsorbed
   organic carbon and nitrogen, as measured by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. Multiple linear regression analysis on initial deposition
   rates, with as explanatory variables the temperature, salinity, pH and
   concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the seawater at the
   time of collection, showed that the concentration of DOC was most
   strongly associated with the initial deposition rates of the three

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We present barium data for sediment traps deployed in a northeast
   Atlantic margin environment (Bay of Biscay). Fluxes of excess barium
   were measured with the objective of calculating carbon export production
   rates from the surface mixed layer and thus contribute to the
   understanding of organic carbon transport in a margin environment.
   Therefore, it was necessary to properly understand the different
   processes that affected the barium fluxes in this margin environment.
   Seasonal variability of POC/Ba flux ratios and decrease of barium
   solubilisation in the trap cups with increasing depth in the water
   column probably indicate that the efficiency of barite formation in the
   organic micro-environment varies with season and that the process is
   relatively slow and not yet completed in the upper 600 m of water
   column. Thus barite presence in biogenic aggregates will significantly
   depend on water column transit time of these aggregates. Furthermore, it
   was observed that significant lateral input of excess-Ba can occur,
   probably associated with residual currents leaving the margin. This
   advected excess-Ba affected especially the recorded fluxes in the deeper
   traps (>1000 m) of the outer slope region. We have attempted to correct
   for this advected excess-Ba component, using Th (reported by others for
   the same samples) as an indicator of enhanced lateral flux and assigning
   a characteristic Ba/Th ratio to advected material, Using transfer
   functions relating excess-Ba flux with export production characteristic
   of margin areas, observed Ba fluxes indicate an export production
   between 7 and 18 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Such values are 3-7 times lower than
   estimates based on N-nutrient uptake and nutrient mass balances, but
   larger and more realistic than is obtained when a transfer function
   characteristic of open ocean systems is applied. The discrepancy between
   export production estimates based on excess-Ba fluxes and nutrient
   uptake could be resolved if part of the carbon is exported as dissolved
   organic matter. Results suggest that margin systems function differently
   from open ocean systems, and therefore Ba-proxy rationales developed for
   open ocean sites might not be applicable in margin areas. (C) 2000

Pages = {{61-72}},
Abstract = {{Sediment trap particles, as well as particulate organic material
   including particles larger than 10 pm collected by in situ pumps (ISP)
   and fresh corpses of the gelatinous zooplankton species Thalia
   democratica, were collected in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea from
   April to July 1995, and incubated (after mixing with 0.2 pm filtered
   seawater) under laboratory conditions with their own bacterial
   assemblages for 6 to 24 d in batches under oxic conditions and in the
   dark. Particulate (POC > 0.7 mu m), dissolved (DOC < 0.7 mu m) and
   colloidal (0.02 < COC < 0.7 mu m) organic carbon contents, as well as
   bacterial abundance and production, were quantified over time. In all
   experiments, total organic carbon (TOC = POC + DOG) decrease covaried
   with an increase in bacterial abundance and production, bacteria being
   the main mediators of particle decomposition. We found that COC
   accounted for 19 to 31\% of DOC immediately after particle dilution in
   0.2 pm filtered seawater, and always for less than 9 \% at the end of
   the experiments. As organic colloids comprised less than 7 \% of DOC in
   the 0.2 pm filtered seawater used to dilute the particles, this result
   suggests that COC was mainly produced from particle decomposition.
   Assuming that bacterial populations were the sole decomposer of organic
   matter in the batches, the results gave bacterial growth efficiencies
   (BGE) in the range of 3 to 21\%, indicating that decomposition of these
   particles significantly produce CO2 through bacterial respiration. The
   results showed that bacteria degraded 16 to 87\% of the initial amount
   of POC within the first 48 h, whereas only 6 to 22 \% of POC was
   degraded in the second stages. Our data and modeling work based on such
   short incubation times suggest that salp bodies are composed of 1 labile
   and 1 refractory organic fraction, whereas both ISP- and trap particles
   are composed of 2 labile and 1 refractory organic fraction. A 1G-model
   (for salp) and a 2G-model for other particles was able to satisfactorily
   reproduce the data sets.}},

Abstract = {{This assessment summarises the current state of knowledge on the
   interactive effects of ozone depletion and climate change on aquatic
   ecosystems, focusing on how these affect exposures to UV radiation in
   both inland and oceanic waters. The ways in which stratospheric ozone
   depletion is directly altering climate in the southern hemisphere and
   the consequent extensive effects on aquatic ecosystems are also
   addressed. The primary objective is to synthesise novel findings over
   the past four years in the context of the existing understanding of
   ecosystem response to UV radiation and the interactive effects of
   climate change. If it were not for the Montreal Protocol, stratospheric
   ozone depletion would have led to high levels of exposure to solar UV
   radiation with much stronger negative effects on all trophic levels in
   aquatic ecosystems than currently experienced in both inland and oceanic
   waters. This ``world avoided{''} scenario that has curtailed ozone
   depletion, means that climate change and other environmental variables
   will play the primary role in regulating the exposure of aquatic
   organisms to solar UV radiation. Reductions in the thickness and
   duration of snow and ice cover are increasing the levels of exposure of
   aquatic organisms to UV radiation. Climate change was also expected to
   increase exposure by causing shallow mixed layers, but new data show
   deepening in some regions and shoaling in others. In contrast,
   climate-change related increases in heavy precipitation and melting of
   glaciers and permafrost are increasing the concentration and colour of
   UV-absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulates. This is
   leading to the ``browning{''} of many inland and coastal waters, with
   consequent loss of the valuable ecosystem service in which solar UV
   radiation disinfects surface waters of parasites and pathogens. Many
   organisms can reduce damage due to exposure to UV radiation through
   behavioural avoidance, photoprotection, and photoenzymatic repair, but
   meta-analyses continue to confirm negative effects of UV radiation
   across all trophic levels. Modeling studies estimating photoinhibition
   of primary production in parts of the Pacific Ocean have demonstrated
   that the UV radiation component of sunlight leads to a 20\% decrease in
   estimates of primary productivity. Exposure to UV radiation can also
   lead to positive effects on some organisms by damaging less UV-tolerant
   predators, competitors, and pathogens. UV radiation also contributes to
   the formation of microplastic pollutants and interacts with artificial
   sunscreens and other pollutants with adverse effects on aquatic
   ecosystems. Exposure to UV-B radiation can decrease the toxicity of some
   pollutants such as methyl mercury (due to its role in demethylation) but
   increase the toxicity of other pollutants such as some pesticides and
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Feeding on microplastics by
   zooplankton can lead to bioaccumulation in fish. Microplastics are found
   in up to 20\% of fish marketed for human consumption, potentially
   threatening food security. Depletion of stratospheric ozone has altered
   climate in the southern hemisphere in ways that have increased oceanic
   productivity and consequently the growth, survival and reproduction of
   many sea birds and mammals. In contrast, warmer sea surface temperatures
   related to these climate shifts are also correlated with declines in
   both kelp beds in Tasmania and corals in Brazil.
   This assessment demonstrates that knowledge of the interactive effects
   of ozone depletion, UV radiation, and climate change factors on aquatic
   ecosystems has advanced considerably over the past four years and
   confirms the importance of considering synergies between environmental
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Despite an increased understanding of functions in sponge microbiomes,
   the interactions among the symbionts and between symbionts and host are
   not well characterized. Here we reconstructed the metabolic interactions
   within the sponge Cymbastela concentrica microbiome in the context of
   functional features of symbiotic diatoms and the host. Three genome bins
   (CcPhy, CcNi and CcThau) were recovered from metagenomic data of C.
   concentrica, belonging to the proteobacterial family Phyllobacteriaceae,
   the Nitrospira genus and the thaumarchaeal order Nitrosopumilales. Gene
   expression was estimated by mapping C. concentrica metatranscriptomic
   reads. Our analyses indicated that CcPhy is heterotrophic, while CcNi
   and CcThau are chemolithoautotrophs. CcPhy expressed many transporters
   for the acquisition of dissolved organic compounds, likely available
   through the sponge's filtration activity and symbiotic carbon fixation.
   Coupled nitrification by CcThau and CcNi was reconstructed, supported by
   the observed close proximity of the cells in fluorescence in situ
   hybridization. CcPhy facultative anaerobic respiration and assimilation
   by diatoms may consume the resulting nitrate. Transcriptional analysis
   of diatom and sponge functions indicated that these organisms are likely
   sources of organic compounds, for example, creatine/creatinine and
   dissolved organic carbon, for other members of the symbiosis. Our
   results suggest that organic nitrogen compounds, for example, creatine,
   creatinine, urea and cyanate, fuel the nitrogen cycle within the sponge.
   This study provides an unprecedented view of the metabolic interactions
   within sponge-microbe symbiosis, bridging the gap between cell-and
   community-level knowledge.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{316-323}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Solid phase extraction (SPE) has become a widespread method for
   isolating dissolved organic matter (DOM) of diverse origin such as fresh
   and marine waters. This study investigated the DOM extraction
   selectivity of 24 commercially available SPE sorbents under identical
   conditions (pH = 2, methanol elution) on the example of Suwannee River
   (SR) water and North Sea (NS) water by using DOC analysis and Fourier
   transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Proton
   nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy was employed to assess
   leaching behavior, and HLB sorbent was found to leach substantially,
   among others. Variable DOC recoveries observed for SR DOM and NS DOM
   were primarily caused by the respective molecular composition, with
   subordinated and heterogeneous contributions of relative salinity.
   Scatter of average H/C and O/C elemental ratios and gross alignment in
   mass-edited H/C ratios according to five established coarse SPE
   characteristics was near identical for SR DOM and NS DOM. FTMS-based
   principal component analysis (PCA) provided essentially analogous
   alignment of SR DOM and NS DOM molecular compositions according to the
   five established groups of SPE classification, and corroborated the
   sorption-mechanism-based selectivity of DOM extraction in both cases.
   Evaluation of structural blanks and leaching of SPE cartridges requires
   NMR spectroscopy because FT-ICR mass spectrometry alone will not reveal
   inconspicuous displacements of continual bulk signatures caused by
   leaching of SPE resin constituents. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{The Molecular Composition of Dissolved Organic Matter in Forest Soils as
   a Function of pH and Temperature}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{We examined the molecular composition of forest soil water during three
   different seasons at three different sites, using electrospray
   ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry
   (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). We examined oxic soils and tested the hypothesis that
   pH and season correlate with the molecular composition of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM). We used molecular formulae and their relative
   intensity from ESI-FT-ICR-MS for statistical analysis. Applying
   unconstrained and constrained ordination methods, we observed that pH,
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and season were the main
   factors correlating with DOM molecular composition. This result is
   consistent with a previous study where pH was a main driver of the
   molecular differences between DOM from oxic rivers and anoxic bog
   systems in the Yenisei River catchment. At a higher pH, the molecular
   formulae had a lower degree of unsaturation and oxygenation, lower
   molecular size and a higher abundance of nitrogen-containing compounds.
   These characteristics suggest a higher abundance of tannin connected to
   lower pH that possibly inhibited biological decomposition. Higher
   biological activity at a higher pH might also be related to the higher
   abundance of nitrogen-containing compounds. Comparing the seasons, we
   observed a decrease in unsaturation, molecular diversity and the number
   of nitrogen-containing compounds in the course of the year from March to
   November. Temperature possibly inhibited biological degradation during
   winter, which could cause the accumulation of a more diverse compound
   spectrum until the temperature increased again. Our findings suggest
   that the molecular composition of DOM in soil pore waters is dynamic and
   a function of ecosystem activity, pH and temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Subtropical oceanic gyres are the most extensive biomes on Earth where
   SAR11 and Prochlorococcus bacterioplankton numerically dominate the
   surface waters depleted in inorganic macronutrients as well as in
   dissolved organic matter. In such nutrient poor conditions
   bacterioplankton could become photoheterotrophic, that is, potentially
   enhance uptake of scarce organic molecules using the available solar
   radiation to energise appropriate transport systems. Here, we assessed
   the photoheterotrophy of the key microbial taxa in the North Atlantic
   oligotrophic gyre and adjacent regions using P-33-ATP, H-3-ATP and
   S-35-methionine tracers. Light-stimulated uptake of these substrates was
   assessed in two dominant bacterioplankton groups discriminated by flow
   cytometric sorting of tracer-labelled cells and identified using
   catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridisation. One
   group of cells, encompassing 48\% of all bacterioplankton, were
   identified as members of the SAR11 clade, whereas the other group (24\%
   of all bacterioplankton) was Prochlorococcus. When exposed to light,
   SAR11 cells took 31\% more ATP and 32\% more methionine, whereas the
   Prochlorococcus cells took 33\% more ATP and 34\% more methionine. Other
   bacterioplankton did not demonstrate light stimulation. Thus, the SAR11
   and Prochlorococcus groups, with distinctly different light-harvesting
   mechanisms, used light equally to enhance, by approximately one-third,
   the uptake of different types of organic molecules. Our findings
   indicate the significance of light-driven uptake of essential organic
   nutrients by the dominant bacterioplankton groups in the surface waters
   of one of the less productive, vast regions of the world's oceans-the
   oligotrophic North Atlantic subtropical gyre. The ISME Journal (2013) 7,

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{128}},

Abstract = {{Absorption spectra of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and
   particles were obtained in May 2007 in the St. Lawrence estuary (SLE.
   Canada), the northwestern Gulf of St. Lawrence (NWG), and the Saguenay
   Fjord (CDOM only), the main tributary of the SLE. CDOM absorption
   generally decreased downstream and with depth and showed an inverse
   relationship to tidal cycles. Phytoplankton absorption in surface water
   of the SLE increased seaward while non-algal particle absorption trended
   oppositely; both variables declined with depth. Surface water CDOM
   absorption surpassed particle absorption in the SLE while phytoplankton
   absorption dominated in the NWG. Elevated non-algal and CDOM absorption
   were found in the turbidity maximum zone near the head of the SLE.
   Enriched CDOM absorption also occurred in the bottom water of the lower
   SLE and NWG. The spectral slope ratio of CDOM absorption, defined as the
   ratio of the spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm to that between 350
   and 400 nm. was confirmed to be an indicator of the source and molecular
   weight of CDOM. This surrogate functionality, however, failed for
   absorption spectra exhibiting shoulders in short ultraviolet wavelengths
   observed in deep waters of the SLE and NWG. CDOM absorption mainly
   displayed conservative mixing behavior in both the SLE and the Saguenay
   Fjord. CDOM was employed to trace the source identity of the Fjord's
   deepwater. It was found that the marine end member of the Fjord's
   deepwater possessed a salinity of 32.92 and a temperature of ca. 1
   degrees C and originated from the intermediate cold layer of the lower
   SLE. The marine end member contributed 94\% of the deepwater by volume
   while freshwater mainly flown from the Saguenay River supplied the
   remaining 6\%. Implications of our results for remote sensing-based
   assessments of primary productivity, surface water circulation, and
   water column photochemistry in the SLE are also discussed. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{This study presents the results of a year-long study investigating the
   characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Danish estuary,
   Horsens Fjord. The estuary is shallow with a mean depth of 2.9 m and
   receives high loadings of inorganic nutrients from its catchment. The
   behaviour of different DOM parameters i.e. dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorous (DOP), light absorption and eight
   fluorescence components, were analysed relative to conservative mixing.
   Many of the parameters did not behave conservatively. For DON, DOP and
   absorption, more than 65\% of the freshwater concentration was removed
   initially at salinities below 12. At higher salinities two general
   patterns were identified. Concentrations of DON, DOP and four humic
   fluorescent fractions were not, or only weakly, related to salinity,
   showing that other processes than mixing were involved. Other parameters
   such as DOC and two terrestrial humic components behaved conservatively.
   The same was true for DON during winter. These results are consistent
   with the finding that autochthonous DOM was the dominant source of DOM
   in this estuary. The molar C:N and C:P ratios for DOM (DOC:DON and
   DOC:DOP) in freshwater were 11 and 758, respectively. The DOC:DON ratio
   increased in the estuary during the productive season to average values
   between 13 and 17, due to accumulation of DOC and removal of DON. The
   DOC:DOP ratio decreased within the estuary showing that in general DOM
   was enriched with phosphorous, however, during the spring, when
   phosphorous was limiting, the DOC:DOP ratio increased due to low DOP
   concentrations. We hypothesise that in estuaries with high loadings of
   inorganic nutrients relative to DOM, production and degradation of DOM
   within the estuary will dominate over allochthonous inputs and control
   both concentration and characteristics of DOM. A conceptual model for
   this hypothesis is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to test the effects of projected sea
   surface warming (according to the IPPC scenarios) on the accumulation
   and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during marine
   phytoplankton blooms in cold seas (< 4 degrees C). Eight mesocosms
   (similar to 1400 L) were filled with natural seawater, and two replicate
   mesocosms each were incubated by raising temperature by +0, +2, +4 and
   +6 degrees C, respectively. The enclosed water was initially fertilized
   with inorganic nutrients to induce the development of phytoplankton
   blooms, which were then dominated by diatoms. Over a 4-week period,
   dissolved combined carbohydrates (DCCHO) and dissolved amino acids (DAA)
   were determined as major components of freshly produced, labile to
   semi-labile DOM. In all mesocosms, the increase in DCCHO concentration
   occurred sharply after the peak of chlorophyll a concentration, when
   nutrients became depleted. Rising temperature resulted in an earlier,
   faster and higher accumulation of DCCHO and of combined glucose
   predominantly. DCCHO yielded a maximum percentage of 35, 40, 49 and 59\%
   of total combined carbohydrates in the +0, +2, +4 and +6 degrees C
   treatments, respectively. Accumulation of DAA occurred more continuously
   and at an average rate of 0.79 +/- 0.20 nmol L-1 h(-1), but was not
   affected by rising temperature. Owing to the higher accumulation of
   DCCHO, the C:N ratio of DOM increased strongly during the course of the
   bloom, with higher ratios in the warmer treatments. Our study suggests
   that warming increases the extracellular release of carbohydrates from
   phytoplankton and, therefore, may affect the bottom-up control of the
   microbial loop in cold seas in the future.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the influence of solar radiation on the transfer of
   organic matter from the particulate to dissolved phase during
   resuspension of coastal sediments collected from seven sites across
   Florida Bay (organic carbon values ranged from 2\% to 9\% by weight).
   Sediments were resuspended in oligotrophic seawater for 48 h in 1-liter
   quartz flasks in the dark and under simulated solar radiation (SunTest
   XLS+) at wet weight concentrations of 100 mg L-1 and 1 g L-1 (dry
   weights ranged from 27 to 630 mg L-1). There were little to no dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) increases in dark resuspensions, but substantial
   DOC increases occurred in irradiated resuspensions. DOC levels increased
   4 mg C L-1 in an irradiated 1 g L-1 suspension (dry weight 400 mg L-1)
   of an organic-rich (7\% organic carbon) sediment. At a particle load
   commonly found in coastal waters (dry weight 40 mg L-1), an irradiated
   suspension of the same organic-rich sediment produced 1 mg C L-1. DOC
   increases in irradiated resuspensions were well-correlated with
   particulate organic carbon (POC) added. Photodissolution of POC ranged
   from 6\% to 15\% at high sediment levels and 10\% to 33\% at low
   sediment levels. Parallel factor analysis modeling of
   excitation-emission matrix fluorescence data (EEM PARAFAC) suggested the
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) produced during photodissolution included
   primarily humic-like components and a less important input of
   protein-like components. Principal component analysis (PCA) of EEM data
   revealed a marked similarity in the humic character of photodissolved
   DOM from organic-rich sediments and the humic character of Florida Bay

Title = {{The dissolved yellow substance and the shades of blue in the
   Mediterranean Sea}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2625-2636}},
Abstract = {{When the nominal algorithms commonly in use in Space Agencies are
   applied to satellite Ocean Color data, the retrieved chlorophyll
   concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea are recurrently notable
   overestimates of the field values. Accordingly, several regionally tuned
   algorithms have been proposed in the past to correct for this deviation.
   Actually, the blueness of the Mediterranean waters is not as deep as
   expected from the actual (low) chlorophyll content, and the modified
   algorithms account for this peculiarity. Among the possible causes for
   such a deviation, an excessive amount of yellow substance (or of
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter, CDOM) has been frequently cited.
   This conjecture is presently tested, by using a new technique simply
   based on the simultaneous consideration of marine reflectance determined
   at four spectral bands, namely at 412, 443, 490, and 555 nm, available
   on the NASA-SeaWiFS sensor (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor). It
   results from this test that the concentration in yellow colored material
   (quantified as a(y), the absorption coefficient of this material at 443
   nm) is about twice that one observed in the nearby Atlantic Ocean at the
   same latitude. There is a strong seasonal signal, with maximal a(y)
   values in late fall and winter, an abrupt decrease beginning in spring,
   and then a flat minimum during the summer months, which plausibly
   results from the intense photo-bleaching process favored by the high
   level of sunshine in these areas. Systematically, the a(y) values,
   reproducible from year to year, are higher in the western basin compared
   with those in the eastern basin (by about 50\%). The relative importance
   of the river discharges into this semi-enclosed sea, as well as the
   winter deep vertical mixing occurring in the northern parts of the
   basins may explain the high yellow substance background. The regionally
   tuned {[}Ch1] algorithms, actually reflect the presence of an excess of
   CDOM with respect to its standard (Chl-related) values. When corrected
   for the presence of the actual CDOM content, the {[}Chl] values as
   derived via the nominal algorithms are restored to more realistic
   values, i.e., approximately divided by about two; the strong autumnal
   increase is smoothed whereas the spring bloom remains as an isolated
   feature.}},

   decreased from 3.1\% in the river to 1.7\% in shelf surface waters while
   particulate C:N concurrently decreased from 17.1 to 8.6. Nitrate and
   silicate concentrations declined by more than 90\% across the salinity
   gradient, with nitrate concentrations often below the conservative
   mixing line. Phosphate concentrations increased from 0.03 mu mol/L in
   the river to 0.27 mu mol/L over shelf waters, thereby changing the
   inorganic nutrient regime downstream from P to N limitation. Dissolved
   organic carbon decreased conservatively offshore while dissolved organic
   N and P persisted at high levels in the Mackenzie plume relative to
   river water, increasing 2.7 and 25.3 times respectively. A deep
   chlorophyll-a maximum was observed at two offshore stations and showed
   increases in most nutrients, particulates and organic matter relative to
   the rest of the water column. During river passage through the Mackenzie
   estuary, particulate matter, dissolved organic carbon and inorganic
   nutrients showed sedimentation, dilution and biological uptake patterns
   common to other arctic and non-arctic estuaries. Alternatively,
   inorganic content of particles increased offshore and dissolved organic
   N and P increased substantially over the shelf, reaching concentrations
   among the highest reported for the Arctic Ocean. These observations are
   consistent with the presence of a remnant ice-constrained ('stamukhi')
   lake from the freshet period and a slow flushing river plume constrained
   by sea-ice in close proximity to shore. Nutrient limitation in surface
   shelf waters during the ARDEX cruise contributed to the striking deep
   chlorophyll-a maximum at 21 m where phytoplankton communities
   congregated at the margin of nutrient-rich deep ocean waters. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{We calculated input of organic carbon to the unproductive, brackish
   water basin of the Gulf of Bothnia from rivers, point sources and the
   atmosphere. We also calculated the net exchange of organic carbon
   between the Gulf of Bothnia and the adjacent marine system, the Baltic
   Proper. We compared the input with sinks for organic carbon; permanent
   incorporation in sediments and mineralization and subsequent evasion of
   CO2 to the atmosphere. The major fluxes were riverine input (1500 Gg C
   year(-1)), exchange with the Baltic Proper (depending on which of
   several possible DOC concentration differences between the basins that
   was used in the calculation, the flux varied between an outflow of 466
   and an input of 950 Gg C year(-1)), sediment burial (1100 Gg C year) and
   evasion to the atmosphere (3610 Gg C year(-1)). The largest single net
   flux was the emission of CO2 to the atmosphere, mainly caused by
   bacterial mineralization of organic carbon. Input and output did not
   match in our budget which we ascribe uncertainties in the calculation of
   the exchange of organic carbon between the Gulf of Bothnia and the
   Baltic Proper, and the fact that CO2 emission, which in our calculation
   represented 1 year (2002) may have been overestimated in comparison with
   long-term means. We conclude that net heterotrophy of the Gulf of
   Bothnia was due to input of organic carbon from both the catchment and
   from the Baltic Proper and that the future degree of net heterotrophy
   will be sensible to both catchment export of organic carbon and to the
   ongoing eutrophication of the Baltic Proper. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

   the silver grain area over time around leucine-assimilating cells of
   coastal bacterial assemblages was linear during 4 to 6 h of incubation.
   By establishing standardized conditions for specific activity levels and
   concomitantly performing uptake measurements with the bulk community,
   MICRO-CARD-FISH can be used quantitatively to determine uptake rates on
   a single-cell level. Therefore, this approach allows comparisons of

Abstract = {{The high permeability of sediments and strong near-bottom currents cause
   seawater to infiltrate the surface layers of Middle Atlantic Bight shelf
   deposits. In this study, sandy sediment cores from 11 to 12 m water
   depth were percolated with filtered seawater on shipboard. Sedimentary
   oxygen consumption (SOC) increased non-linearly with pore water flow,
   approaching maximum rates of 120 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (May 2001) or 75 mmol
   m(-2) d(-1) (July 2001). The addition of acetate to the inflowing water
   promptly enhanced the release of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from
   the cores. DIC production rates were a linear function of acetate
   concentration, ranging from 100 to 300 mmol m(-2) d(-1) without
   substrate addition to 572 mmol m(-2) d(-1) with 100 mM acetate. The
   sediments also hydrolyzed a glucose pseudopolymer, and the liberated
   glucose prompted an increase of SOC. Our results suggest that
   decomposition rates of organic matter in permeable sands can exceed
   those of fine-grained, organic-rich deposits, when water currents cause
   advective interstitial flow, supplying the subsurface microbial
   community with degradable material and electron acceptors. We conclude
   that the highly permeable sand beds of the Middle Atlantic Bight are
   responsive within minutes to hours and efficiently operate as
   biocatalytical filters.}},

   isolated from Pamvotis Lake) and nitrate ions was also examined. It was
   found that photodegradation proceeds via a pseudo-first-order reaction
   in all cases. The presence of DOM inhibits the photolysis reaction with
   half-lives ranging from 87 to 693 In whereas the degradation rate was
   accelerated up to 11 times in the presence of NO3-. In addition, the
   toxicity of the degradation products formed (generally through
   hydroxylation, dealkylation, and cyclization reactions) was also
   performed using the marine luminescent bacterium Vibrio fisheri. Our
   results indicated a toxicity increase of the irradiated solution showing

Abstract = {{A model of UV-induced DNA damage in oceanic bacterioplankton was

   The model describes the effects of solar irradiance, wind-forced mixing

   photoreactivation and excision. The modeled damage is compared with
   measured variability of CPD in the ocean: diel variation in natural
   bacterioplankton communities at the surface and in vertical profiles
   under different wind conditions (net damage as influenced by repair and
   mixing); in situ incubation of natural assemblages of bacterioplankton
   (damage and repair, no mixing); and in situ incubation of DNA solutions
   (no repair, no mixing). The model predictions are generally consistent
   with the measurements, showing similar patterns with depth, time and
   wind speed. A sensitivity analysis assesses the effect on net DNA damage
   of varying ozone thickness, colored dissolved organic matter
   concentration, chlorophyll concentration. wind speed and mixed layer
   depth. Ozone thickness and mixed layer depth are the most important

Abstract = {{Net in situ production and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and
   nitrogen (DON) have been studied in shelf waters off the Ria de Vigo (NW
   Spain), as part of a comprehensive hydrographic survey carried out from
   September 1994 to September 1995 with a fortnight periodicity. DOC and
   DON correlated well (r = + 0.78), the slope of the regression line being
   12.0 +/- 0.7 mol-C mol-N-1, about twice the Redfieldian slope of
   particulate organic matter, 6.5 +/- 0.2 mol-C mol-N-1 (r= +0.95). Labile
   DOC and DON accumulated in the upper 50 m during the upwelling season
   (March-September), mainly after prolonged periods of wind relaxation,
   when horizontal flows were reduced. This labile material represented
   50\% and 35\% of the total (dissolved + particulate) organic carbon and
   nitrogen susceptible of microbial utilisation, which assert the key
   contribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the export of new
   primary production in the NW Iberian upwelling system. This surface
   excess in shelf waters appeared to be formed into the highly productive
   Ria de Vigo (a large coastal indentation) at net rates of similar to 4.4
   mu M-C d(-1) and similar to 1.3 mu M-C d(-1) in the inner and outer
   segments of the embayment respectively, and subsequently exported to the
   shelf. Once in the shelf, simple dilution with the inert DOM pool of
   recently upwelled Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) occurred.
   Eventually, the DOM excess produced during the upwelling season is
   exported to the adjacent open ocean waters by the coastal circulation.
   Conversely, during the unproductive downwelling season
   (October-February), the lowest DOC and DON levels were recorded and
   export was prevented by the characteristic downwelling front associated
   to the seasonal poleward slope current. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title = {{Mineralization and burial of organic carbon in sediments of the southern
   Weddell Sea (Antarctica)}},

Abstract = {{Benthic fluxes of oxygen, alkalinity (A(T)), total carbonate (C-T or
   Sigma CO2) and dissolved organic carbon (DOG) were measured during
   sediment-water incubations al 16 stations in the southern Weddell Sea
   (Antarctica) with water depths between 280 and 2514 m. The total
   sediment oxygen consumption rates (TSOC) were in general low (1.74-3.61
   mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and more comparable to measurements in slope and
   deep-sea sediments at a few thousand meters water depth. The decrease of
   TSOC with water depth was lower than that observed in many other seas.
   The mean carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) in the solid phase of surficial
   sediment was 8.3. Measured benthic fluxes of alkalinity, corrected for
   contributions from nitrification and denitrification, were
   quantitatively used to correct the fluxes of total carbonate for
   dissolution of solid phase carbonates. The Sigma CO2 fluxes, originating
   from carbonate dissolution (0.166- 1.77 mmol m(-2) day(-1)), were
   2.6-71\% of the Sigma CO2 fluxes (0.984-3.73 mmol m(-2) day(-1))
   resulting from organic carbon oxidation. Measured benthic fluxes of
   oxygen, Sigma CO2 and nitrate were, together with estimated
   denitrification rates and sediment C/N ratios, used to model respiration
   quotients (RQ) for organic carbon oxidation and estimate composition of
   the organic matter undergoing degradation. Modelled RQ varied roughly
   between 2/3 and 1 (mean 0.87). Measured fluxes of Sigma CO2 were 1.6-3.2
   times higher than integrated organic C mineralization rates (measured
   during closed incubations of sieved, homogenized sediment), indicating
   macrofaunal (plus possibly meiofaunal) respiration to be important.
   However, low abundances of bioirrigating benthic macrofauna and small
   differences in benthic fluxes of oxygen, Sigma CO2 and alkalinity found
   between replicate sediment cores, suggested that macrofaunal respiration
   was quantitatively unimportant in these sediments. The higher measured
   fluxes of Sigma CO2, compared to the integrated mineralization rates,
   were therefore most likely caused by a large fraction of the respiration
   occurring directly on the sediment surface. This degradation of newly
   deposited organic matter was not reflected in the integrated organic C
   mineralization rates. Also, there was no obvious effect of this
   surficial degradation process on the pore water distributions of Sigma
   CO2. Benthic mass balances of carbon revealed that benthic fluxes of DOC
   were 3-147\% of the corrected fluxes of Sigma CO2, and the recycling
   efficiencies (E) were up to 35\% higher if the DOC fluxes were included
   in the calculations of E, rather than the inorganic Sigma CO2 flux
   alone. The recycling efficiencies, including the benthic flux of DOG,
   ranged between 57 and 88\% (mean 78\%). Measured rates of inorganic C
   accumulation (for most stations <0.3 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)) were a factor
   of 6-7 lower than organic C accumulation rates (0.457-1.94 mmol C m(-2)
   day(-1)). (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In experiments examining the retention of trace elements in decomposing
   zooplankton debris, the rates of C degradation and metal release from
   radiolabeled copepod fecal pellets and carcasses were measured for up to
   1 mo using radiotracers. Fecal pellets incubated at 18 and 2-degrees-C
   retained 35 to 40 \% and 80 \% of their C-14, respectively, after 30 d.
   Carcasses retained only 13 to 18 \% and 28 to 38 \% of their C-14 after
   18 d at 18 and 2-degrees-C, respectively. Leaching of C-14 from fecal
   pellets and carcasses as (DOC)-C-14 accounted for about half of the C-14
   loss, even in the absence of microbial activity. Proportionately more of
   the C-14 from carcasses was microbially oxidized to (CO2)-C-14 than C-14
   from fecal pellets. Release of the particle-reactive transuranic element
   Am-241 from fecal pellets was unaffected by microbial activity while
   release of Se-75 and Zn-65 from both fecal pellets and carcasses
   increased with microbial activity and closely followed C-14 loss.
   Release rates of all elements decreased exponentially over time, with
   the most pronounced decreases occurring within the first 6 d. Retention
   half-times (t(r1/2)'s) of Am-241 were greater-than-or-equal-to 48 d in
   fecal pellets. By contrast, the t(r1/2)'s for Zn-65 ranged from 2.1 to
   13.5 d in fecal pellets and both Zn-65 and Se-75 had t(r1/2)'s of only
   about 1 d in carcasses. The results help explain oceanographic
   observations that C, Se and Zn are recycled in surface waters while
   scavenged elements like Am are enriched in fecal pellets and have short
   residence times in surface waters.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has greatly changed our knowledge of processes affecting
   organic matter in the water column. Here we review some of this recent
   research and suggest several areas which are particularly challenging
   for future studies. Major areas discussed are newly developed methods of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis and the implications of the
   results, and the potential significance of organic colloids in seawater.
   Recent advances in techniques for the analysis of small, labile organic
   molecules and in radiotracer techniques used to follow rates and
   mechanisms of biological consumption are also discussed.
   Ocean-atmosphere transport and photochemical processes can act as both
   sources and sinks of organic matter in the sea. This is an area where
   significant progress has been made recently. Finally, we discuss current
   knowledge of river transport to the oceans and particle sedimentation in
   the sea as well as some of the limitations on this knowledge.}},

   using spectroscopic analysis}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{403-417}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a major component of DOM in
   waters, and plays a vital role in carbon cycling in inland waters. In
   this study, the light absorption and three-dimensional excitation
   emission matrix spectra (EEMs) of CDOM of 936 water samples collected in
   2014-2017 from 234 lakes in five regions across China were examined to
   determine relationships between lake water sources (fresh versus saline)
   and their fluorescence/absorption characteristics. Results indicated
   significant differences regarding DOC concentration and a(CDOM)(254)
   between freshwater (6.68 mg C L-1, 19.55 m(-1)) and saline lakes (27.4
   mg C L-1, 41.17 m(-1)). While humic-like (F-5) and fulvic-like (F-3)
   compounds contributed to CDOM fluorescence in all lake waters
   significantly, their contribution to total fluorescence intensity (F-T)
   differed between saline and freshwater lakes. Significant negative
   relationships were also observed between lake altitude with either F-5
   (R-2 = 0.63, N = 306) or F-T (R-2 = 0.64, N = 306), suggesting that the
   abundance of humic-like materials in CDOM tends to decrease with
   increased in lakes altitude. In high altitude lakes, strong solar
   irradiance and UV exposure may have induced photo-oxidation reactions
   resulting in decreased abundance of humic-like substances and the
   formation of low molecular weight compounds. These findings have
   important implications regarding our understanding of C dynamics in
   lacustrine systems and the contribution of these ecosystems to the
   global C cycle. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Glaciers and ice sheets are significant sources of dissolved organic
   carbon and nutrients to downstream subglacial and marine ecosystems.
   Climatically driven increases in glacial runoff are expected to
   intensify the impact of exported nutrients on local and regional
   downstream environments. However, the origin and bioreactivity of
   dissolved organic carbon from glacier surfaces are not fully understood.
   Here, we present simultaneous measurements of gross primary production,
   community respiration, dissolved organic carbon composition and export
   from different surface habitats of the Greenland ice sheet, throughout
   the ablation season. We found that microbial production was
   significantly correlated with the concentration of labile dissolved
   organic species in glacier surface meltwater. Further, we determined
   that freely available organic compounds made up 62\% of the dissolved
   organic carbon exported from the glacier surface through streams. We
   therefore conclude that microbial communities are the primary driver for
   labile dissolved organic carbon production and recycling on glacier
   surfaces, and that glacier dissolved organic carbon export is dependent
   on active microbial processes during the melt season.}},

Abstract = {{Scattering alters the path of photons, but ultimately their removal from
   the water column occurs by absorption by one of four components: water
   itself, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), phytoplankton pigments
   or non-algal particulate matter (NAP). We calculated absorption budgets
   for two fjordal systems, Godthabsfjord (SW Greenland) and Young Sound
   (NE Greenland), based on these components and evaluated the fate of
   solar radiation in each system. Absorption by phytoplankton pigment
   accounted for 15-32\% of photons in Godthabsfjord whilst in Young Sound
   the corresponding fraction was only 5-8\%. NAP accounted for 13-25\% of
   absorption in Young Sound and only 7-8\% in Godthabsfjord whilst
   fractions of absorption by CDOM were more similar: 6-13\% in
   Godthabsfjord and 6 -18\% in Young Sound.
   In typical temperate estuarine systems, nutrients, CDOM and particulate
   matter are supplied by riverine sources. Increased nutrient supply will
   tend to increase productivity whilst increased concentrations of CDOM
   and particles will increase light attenuation, thereby reducing
   productivity. The two Greenlandic fjords differ from typical estuarine
   systems in that their supply of nutrients and particles is decoupled.
   Freshwater feeding them comes from glacial melt and contains particles
   but low concentrations of nutrients. New nutrients are supplied by
   entrainment of oceanic water at the mouths of the fjords and sediment
   water exchange of remineralized nutrients. Attenuation and thereby light
   availability in the two fjords is strongly correlated with turbidity
   (Godthabsfjord: r(2) = 0.90 p <0.01, Young Sound: r(2) = 0.82 p < 0.001)
   and we conclude that loading of particulate matter controls light
   attenuation, and through this may influence primary production. Previous
   studies argue that warming due to climate change will increase
   productivity in the fjords. We suggest that increased runoff and
   particle load may have an opposite effect. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) ubiquitously occurs in
   marine environments and plays a significant role in the marine
   biogeochemical cycles. Basin scale distributions of CDOM have recently
   been surveyed in the global ocean and indicate that quantity and quality
   of oceanic CDOM are mainly controlled by in situ production and
   photobleaching. However, factors controlling the spectral parameters of
   CDOM in the UV region, i.e., spectral slope of CDOM determined at
   275-295 nm (S275-295) and the ratio of two spectral slope parameters
   (S-R); the ratio of S275-295 to S350-400, have not been well documented.
   To evaluate the factor controlling the spectral characteristics of CDOM
   in the UV region in the open ocean, we determined the quantitative and
   qualitative characteristics of CDOM in the subarctic and subtropical
   surface waters (5-300 m) of the western North Pacific. Absorption
   coefficients at 320 nm in the subarctic region were higher than those in
   the subtropical region throughout surface waters, suggesting that
   magnitudes of photobleaching were different between the two regions. The
   values of S275-295 and SR were also higher in the subtropical region
   than the subarctic region. The dark microbial incubation showed
   biodegradation of DOM little affected S275-295, but slightly decreased
   SR. On the other hand, increases in S275-295 and relative stableness of
   SR were observed during photo-irradiation incubations respectively.
   These experimental results indicated that photobleaching of CDOM mainly
   induced qualitative differences in CDOM at UV region between the
   subarctic and subtropical surface waters. The results of this study
   imply that S275-295 can be used as a tracer of photochemical history of
   CDOM in the open ocean.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the photoreactivity of chromophoric dissolved organic matter
   (CDOM) derived from Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) leaf litter and
   floating Sargassum colonies as these marine plants can be important
   contributors to coastal and open ocean CDOM pools, respectively.
   Mangrove and Sargassum CDOM readily degraded when exposed to simulated
   solar irradiance (CPS SunTest solar simulator exposures). CDOM produced
   from brown mangrove leaves (representative of substantial senescence)
   exhibited shorter photobleaching half-lives (a(305) t(1/2)<50 h) than
   CDOM produced from yellow and orange (early and mid senescence) leaves
   (a(305) t(1/2)similar to 60-90 h). Mangrove CDOM photobleaching rates
   were higher in the mid-UVA (a(350)) than in the UVB (a(305)) spectral
   region. Photobleaching half-lives of Sargassum CDOM were mostly <40 hand
   more consistent across UVB (a(305)) and UVA (a(350)) wavelengths.
   Sargassum CDOM photomineralized during simulated solar irradiation
   producing DIC at rates exceeding 2500 nmol m l(-1) h(-1), indicating
   that regions of the surface ocean with large concentrations of this
   plant may provide a strong CO2 source to the atmosphere. Sargassum CDOM
   photoreactions also produced CO more efficiently than terrestrial CDOM
   and much more efficiently than ambient CDOM in the open ocean. Thus,
   biological production of CDOM may be the rate-limiting step for
   photoproduction of DIC from Sargassum and other sources in the open
   ocean. An examination of CDOM photobleaching in Florida Keys coastal
   waters indicates that one month of summertime solar radiation may
   substantially increase UVB and UVA exposure to corals in shallow waters
   (<4 m), especially along the offshore reef tract. But, our results also
   indicate that when ambient CDOM levels are high, the corals are
   well-buffered against increases in ultraviolet radiation (UV-R) exposure
   even after periods of extended CDOM photobleaching. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{In the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC, environmental objectives
   for the proper quality of inland, surface, transitional, coastal, and
   ground waters have been set. Member states are required to identify
   chemical pollutants of significance in the water bodies, to establish
   emission control measures, and to achieve quality standards. A specific
   category of pollutants are the compounds that may possess
   endocrine-related functions known as endocrine disrupting compounds
   (EDCs). This means that member states have the obligation to take action
   in order to prevent human exposure to these compounds via aquatic
   environment. The objective of this research was to study the occurrence
   and distribution of phenolic and steroid EDCs in inland waters and
   wastewaters discharged in the area of Thermaikos Gulf, Thessaloniki,
   Northern Greece.
   Samples were collected from three rivers, four streams, and four
   municipal and industrial wastewaters from the area of Thessaloniki,
   Northern Greece, during the period 2005-2006. The samples were analyzed
   for 14 EDCs (nonylphenol, octylphenol, their mono- and di-ethoxylate
   oligomers, bisphenol A, estrone, 17 alpha-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol,
   estriol, mestranol, and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol). The compounds were
   recovered by solid phase extraction and ultrasonic extraction from the
   dissolved phase and particulate phase, respectively, and determined by
   employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   Results revealed the presence of phenolic EDCs (NP, NP1EO, NP2EO, tOP,
   OP1EO, OP2EO, and BPA) in all water and wastewater samples. Steroid EDCs
   were not found at detectable concentrations. The relationships between
   field partition coefficients of EDCs and concentration of total
   suspended solids, dissolved, and particulate organic carbon were
   investigated.
   Rivers exhibited concentrations of EDCs similar to minimally impacted
   surface waters worldwide. The concentrations of NP and OP occasionally
   exceeded the environmental quality criteria proposed for inland waters.
   The concentrations of EDCs in streams exhibited wide variations due to
   low flow rate in these systems and the impact of wastewaters from
   various pollution sources. Wastewater from tannery activities showed
   extremely high concentrations of NP, whereas relatively high
   concentrations of EDCs were determined in effluents from the industrial
   wastewater treatment plant. Field partition coefficients of EDCs are
   negatively correlated with concentrations of total suspended solids and
   dissolved organic carbon and positively correlated with particulate
   organic carbon.
   The examined rivers (Aliakmon, Axios, and Loudias) exhibited
   concentrations of EDCs similar to minimally impacted surface waters
   worldwide. However, special attention should be paid to these systems
   since the concentrations for NP and OP occasionally were above the
   proposed quality standards, revealing the impact of urban, industrial,
   and agricultural activities. High concentrations of EDCs were determined
   in streams, urban, and industrial wastewater posing significant risk to
   the aquatic environment they discharged.
   The occurrence of EDCs in inland waters and wastewaters discharged to
   Thermaikos Gulf results in an increased risk to the marine environment.
   Thus, these systems should be regularly monitored, especially for NP,
   OP, and BPA that are considered as priority hazardous compounds in the
   Water Framework Directive.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved and particulate organic matters from different stations and
   depths in the St Lawrence estuarine system (Canada) were collected and
   extracted using humic substance (HS) fractionation protocols. The
   origin, composition, and fate of organic matter/HS were assessed by
   distribution characteristics, elemental and isotopic compositions, and
   infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRIFTS). HS represented over
   50\% of dissolved organic matter in the Saguenay Fjord's surface waters
   but this proportion decreased to 9-19\% in the St. Lawrence Lower
   Estuary (SLLE). Fulvic acids were the dominant component (68-92\%) of
   dissolved HS, especially in high salinity waters having very low humic
   acid content. Dissolved organic carbon (0.8-7.0 mg L-1) and dissolved HS
   concentrations steadily decreased with downstream distance and depth.
   Isotopic and elemental data indicated that dissolved HS were mostly
   terrigenous, even in the SLLE deep waters.
   HS represented 62-100\% of total particulate organic matter (POM)
   collected by sediment traps. Humin, the POM associated with the mineral
   matrix, was the dominant fraction of HS followed by humic acids and
   fulvic acids. The POM and its HS were mostly terrigenous in the fjord
   but mostly marine in the SLLE. Unlike its dissolved counterpart, a large
   part of the POM appeared to be mineralized in the water-column, even at
   relatively shallow (<200 m) locations receiving large terrigenous
   inputs. At the upstream portion of the SLLE, it was estimated that 290
   mu molCcm(-2)y(-1) was lost during sinking and shortly after deposition,
   corresponding to an O-2 demand of more than 360 mu molO(2)cm(-2)y(-1)
   assuming aerobic respiration. Distribution profiles indicated a rapid
   particulate HS removal during sinking (16-29\%) and at the
   water-sediment interface (up to 70\% total removal). These losses were
   especially important for N-containing molecules, aliphatic components,
   and marine non-humic POM. In contrast, humin was the most stable
   fraction. The interactions between POM and the mineral matrix appeared
   mediated by carboxylate groups.
   Differences in the composition of dissolved HS and particulate HS may
   explain their contrasting reactivities. Dissolved HS were nitrogen-poor,
   more oxidized, and depleted in aliphatic structures as compared to POM.
   The aliphatic content of dissolved and particulate HS was greater in
   marine samples (downstream) and decreased during diagenesis. The
   proportion of CH3 groups relative to CH2 groups was surprisingly high in
   dissolved fulvic acids, an important fraction of DOM. DRIFTS was
   particularly useful in providing information on HS structures and
   transformations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a significant role in freshwater
   and marine aquatic ecosystems including its effects on nutrients and
   carbon cycling and trace metal and contaminant availability. The colored
   fraction of DOM, CDOM, directly affects the quantity and spectral
   quality of available light, thereby impacting both primary production
   and UV exposure in aquatic ecosystems. Measuring the DOM absorption
   coefficient in situ is difficult because it requires prefiltration of
   the sample. From measurements made in inland, riverine, estuarine and
   coastal environments, we show that using the WETStar fluorometer (WET
   Labs), good estimates of dissolved absorption can be obtained from DOM
   fluorescence (DOM-FL) measured in situ on unfiltered samples. DOM-FL
   measured with the in situ fluorometer compare very well to values
   obtained on filtered samples using more sophisticated laboratory
   spectrofluorometers. Acquisition of high frequency, long-term data
   series or high-resolution profiles is feasible and artifacts resulting
   from filtration or sample storage can be avoided when measurements are
   made using the WETStar DOM fluorometer. The utility of high-resolution
   DOM-FL profiles for biogeochemical studies is illustrated by in situ
   data obtained in the East Siberian Sea. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

   metalloprotease family M42 led us to question whether CelM is involved
   in the degradation of polysaccharides or proteins. PCR primers were
   designed for the celM genes in the Sargasso Sea WGS data set and used to
   identify celM in a fosmid library constructed with prokaryotic DNA from
   the western Arctic Ocean. Expression analysis of the Cytophaga-like
   Arctic CelM, which is 63\% identical and 77\% similar to CelM in C.
   hutchinsonii, indicated that there was peptidase activity, whereas
   cellulase activity was not detected. Our analysis suggests that the celM
   gene plays a role in the degradation of protein by Cytophaga-like
   bacteria. The abundance of peptidase genes in the Cytophaga-like fosmid
   clone provides further evidence for the importance of Cytophaga-like
   bacteria in the degradation of protein in high-molecular-weight
   dissolved organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated plankton dynamics and the role of nutrients (organic and
   inorganic) during an intense (>1.5 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)) and sustained
   (>4 mo) brown tide bloom of the pelagophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens
   during the summer of 2000 in Great South Bay (GSB), New York, USA.
   During the study, light and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) levels
   were low (mean 1\% light depth = 2 m, mean DIN = 0.7 muM), while
   dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen levels were high (mean = 600 and
   45 muM, respectively). Co-occurring with the A. anophagefferens bloom
   was a consortium of other small phytoplankton: 60 +/- 19\% of
   chlorophyll present during the bloom was <2 mum and pico-cyanobacteria
   achieved densities >10(6) cells ml(-1) following the peak of the brown
   tide. Although the growth of non-brown-tide phytoplankton, such as
   picocyanobacteria, was consistently enhanced by nitrate and urea
   additions (during 100\%, of experiments conducted, n = 18), the net
   population growth of A. anophagefferens was not stimulated by
   N-enrichment in 60\% of the experiments. During bloom initiation,
   decreases in DOC, DON, and DOP concentrations in GSB were similar to
   concurrent calculated increases in cellular C, N, and P of the
   burgeoning A. anophagefferens population, suggesting direct or indirect
   utilization of compounds within these pools by brown tide and associated
   microbes, In contrast, levels of DOM rose sharply when A.
   anophagefferens densities decreased and picocyanobacteria became the
   dominant phototrophs. These results illustrate a dichotomy in the algal
   communities of estuaries which host brown tides: often nitrogen-replete
   A. anophagefferens populations which are associated with DOM degradation
   and non-brown-tide phytoplankton populations such as picocyanobacteria
   which are consistently nitrogen-limited and associated with water column
   accumulation of DOTA.}},

Abstract = {{Relations between sediment properties and pools of organic carbon and
   microbial biomass were investigated in sediments of shallow water
   coastal inlets of the southern Baltic Sea (Rassower Strom, Nordrugensche
   Bodden). According to their mud content (percentage of the fraction < 63
   mum to total sediment dry weight), sediments were grouped into sand,
   slightly muddy sand, and muddy sand. Phospholipids and ATP were analysed
   to estimate total and `active' microbial biomass. From measurements of
   chlorophyll a (chl a) and total bacterial numbers, photoautotrophic
   microbial and bacterial biomasses were estimated. Carbon pools were
   determined by total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic and
   inorganic carbon (DOC, DIC), and available dissolved organic carbon
   (ADOC). The latter was measured by means of a biosensor consisting of an
   oxygen microelectrode with bacteria attached to the tip. Nitrogen and
   phosphorus were also analysed. Size and composition of carbon pools and
   microbial biomass revealed pronounced differences related to the mud
   content of the sediments. Sandy sediments were characterized by a high
   contribution of DOC and ADOC to TOC. Microbial biomass could be equally
   estimated by phospholipid-, ATP-, and chi-a-based carbon. Bacterial
   carbon constituted 5 \% of the total microbial biomass carbon. With
   increasing mud content from sandy and slightly muddy sand towards muddy
   sand sediments, TOC and DOC increased, whereas ADOC decreased. In the
   same way, total microbial (phospholipid based) and bacterial biomass
   increased; whereas the contribution of photoautotrophic(chl a based) and
   active (ATP based) biomass to total biomass declined to 31 and 18\%,
   respectively. As demonstrated by increasing ratios of carbon to
   nitrogen, nitrogen to phosphorus, and decreasing ratios of chi a to
   phaeopigments, the organic matter undergoes increasing aging from sandy
   to muddy sand sediments. Pronounced relationships between phospholipid
   and bacterial based biomass on the one hand and between ATP and chi a on
   the other suggested similar structural and physiological features of
   corresponding biomass indicators. Total phospholipid based microbial
   biomass and bacterial biomass were closely related to mud content as
   well as to organic matter (carbon, nitrogen), whereas photoautotrophic
   and `active' microbial biomass measured as chi a and ATP seemed to be
   inversely related to mud content. From the direct relation between
   photoautotrophic biomass and ADOC, it is suggested that easily
   decomposable carbon for microbial utilization was supported by exudation
   during photosynthesis.}},

   of aggregates did not vary between species or runs and ranged from 4 to
   12. Microscopic examination of aggregates showed that they contained
   large numbers of rod-shaped bacteria. The data were interpreted to
   suggest that aggregates are composed of live and dead bacteria, other
   microbes, and extracellular material. The ingestion of aggregates of
   this type by consumers is a potentially important route for the flow of

Abstract = {{Marine organic matter is one of Earth's largest actively cycling
   reservoirs of organic carbon and nitrogen(1,2). The processes
   controlling organic matter production and removal are important for
   carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles, which regulate climate.
   However, the many possible cycling mechanisms have hindered our ability
   to quantify marine organic matter transformation, degradation and
   turnover rates(3,4). Here we analyse existing and new measurements of
   the carbon: nitrogen ratio and radiocarbon age of organic matter
   spanning sizes from large particulate organic matter to small dissolved
   organic molecules. We find that organic matter size is negatively
   correlated with radiocarbon age and carbon: nitrogen ratios in coastal,
   surface and deep waters of the Pacific Ocean. Our measurements suggest
   that organic matter is increasingly chemically degraded as it decreases
   in size, and that small particles and molecules persist in the ocean
   longer than their larger counterparts. Based on these correlations, we
   estimate the production rates of small, biologically recalcitrant
   dissolved organic matter molecules at 0.11-0.14 Gt of carbon and about
   0.005 Gt of nitrogen per year in the deep ocean. Our results suggest
   that the preferential remineralization of large over small particles and
   molecules is a key process governing organic matter cycling and deep
   ocean carbon storage.}},

Abstract = {{Chile is the second largest producer of salmonids worldwide. The first
   step in the production of salmonids takes place in land-based
   aquacultures. However, the effects of the discharge from these
   aquacultures on stream dissolved organic matter (DOM) content, molecular
   composition and degradability are unknown. The aim of this study was
   thus to investigate the inputs of anthropogenic DOM from land-based
   aquaculture to the predominantly pristine river systems of North
   Patagonia. We hypothesized, that i) DOM exported from land-based
   aquaculture mainly consists of protein-like fluorescence (tyrosine and
   tryptophan) released from fish feces and food remains, and that ii) this
   DOM is highly degradable and therefore rapidly turned-over within the
   receiving streams. In the North Patagonian region we conducted a
   screening of ten land-based aquacultures and an intensive sampling
   campaign for one aquaculture. This was combined with longitudinal
   transects and a degradation experiment in order to couple the
   composition of DOM exported from land-based aquacultures to its
   degradability in streams. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   concentration by high-temperature catalytic oxidation and DOM
   composition by fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis.
   In the effluent of the ten screened aquacultures and in the repeated
   sampling of one aquaculture, we consistently found an increase of DOC
   concentrations and a dominance of protein-like fluorescence. The
   protein-like fluorescence rapidly disappeared downstream of the
   aquacultures, and in the degradation experiment. 21\% of the DOC export
   from the repeatedly sampled aquaculture resulted from food addition and
   76\% from fish production. We conclude that large amounts of degradable
   DOM are exported from land-based aquacultures. This probably has strong
   effects on the ecological structure and function of North Patagonian
   streams, and similarly affected streams worldwide. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Subterranean estuaries (STEs) are important biogeochemical land-sea
   interfaces, where fresh groundwater mixes with seawater in coastal
   aquifers. However, the sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the
   connection of its molecular-level processing to pore water chemistry and
   redox conditions in these ecosystems are still not well understood. We
   studied the cycling of DOM in the STE of an intertidal sandy beach of
   the North Sea on spatial and seasonal scales. Ultrahigh-resolution mass
   spectrometry was used to identify thousands of DOM molecular formulae.
   These data were interpreted in the context of inorganic pore water
   chemistry, stable carbon isotope composition of solid-phase extracted
   (SPE) DOM and chemical tracers for bioavailable (dissolved
   carbohydrates, DCHOs) as well as biorefractory DOM (dissolved black
   carbon, DBC). Numerical modelling was used to estimate pore water
   residence times indicating relatively young pore water in the upper
   saline plume (USP, <4 years) and decades-old groundwater in the
   freshwater discharge tube. The detected levels of dissolved Fe and
   ammonium in the USP at sediment depths exceeding 50 cm demonstrated
   suboxic conditions. Statistical analyses revealed complex biotic and
   abiotic DOM processing apart from conservative mixing of marine and
   terrestrial endmembers. We propose that the input of bioavailable marine
   and terrestrial DOM, such as DCHOs, by percolating seawater and meteoric
   groundwater and its degradation by microbes caused oxygen depletion
   favoring Fe oxide/hydroxide reduction. In the freshwater discharge tube,
   the presence of highly aromatic compounds, DBC, and C-13-depleted
   SPE-DOM indicated the intrusion of meteoric groundwater containing
   terrestrial DOM. The discharge of this groundwater appears to be a
   significant source of nutrients (e.g., ammonium) and biorefractory, e.g.
   combustion-derived, DOM to the adjacent water column. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Jellyfish Modulate Bacterial Dynamic and Community Structure}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Jellyfish blooms have increased in coastal areas around the world and
   the outbreaks have become longer and more frequent over the past few
   decades. The Mediterranean Sea is among the heavily affected regions and
   the common bloom forming taxa are scyphozoans Aurelia aurita s.l.,
   Pelagia noctiluca, and Rhizostoma pulmo. Jellyfish have few natural
   predators, therefore their carcasses at the termination of a bloom
   represent an organic-rich substrate that supports rapid bacterial
   growth, and may have a large impact on the surrounding environment. The
   focus of this study was to explore whether jellyfish substrate have an
   impact on bacterial community phylotype selection. We conducted in situ
   jellyfish enrichment experiment with three different jellyfish species.
   Bacterial dynamic together with nutrients were monitored to assess
   decaying jellyfish-bacteria dynamics. Our results show that jellyfish
   biomass is characterized by protein rich organic matter, which is highly
   bioavailable to `jellyfish - associated' and `free - living' bacteria,
   and triggers rapid shifts in bacterial population dynamics and
   composition. Based on 16S rRNA clone libraries and denaturing gradient
   gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, we observed a rapid shift in
   community composition from unculturable Alphaproteobacteria to
   culturable species of Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria. The results
   of sequence analyses of bacterial isolates and of total bacterial
   community determined by culture independent genetic analysis showed the
   dominance of the Pseudoalter-omonadaceae and the Vibrionaceae families.
   Elevated levels of dissolved proteins, dissolved organic and inorganic
   nutrient release, bacterial abundance and carbon production as well as
   ammonium concentrations characterized the degradation process. The
   biochemical composition of jellyfish species may influence changes in
   the amount of accumulated dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients. Our
   results can contribute insights into possible changes in bacterial
   population dynamics and nutrient pathways following jellyfish blooms
   which have important implications for ecology of coastal waters.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from different
   origins (estuarine, coastal, and diatom decomposed) and chloride (CI) on
   the uptake of inorganic mercury {[}Hg(II)] and methylated mercury (MeHg)
   by the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was investigated using
   radiotracer techniques. We first developed a new method to remove the
   surface adsorbed mercury and quantified the intracellular mercury uptake
   by the diatoms. The dominant mercury species (DOC or chloride complexes,
   based on the mercury speciation phase diagrams) was controlled by the
   concentrations of DOC and Cl-, which could explain the effects of DOC
   and Cl- on mercury uptake. DOC complexes dominated Hg(II)'s speciation
   and reduced its uptake in most seawater examined. DOC complexes
   dominated MeHg's speciation only at relatively high DOC levels (>100
   AM), but it could affect MeHg uptake even when MeHg-Cl complexes
   dominated. In a mercury-DOC complex dominated system, both the origin
   and quantity of DOC greatly influenced mercury uptake by the diatoms.
   Although DOC generally inhibited the uptake of Hg(II) or MeHg, DOC
   resulting from diatom decomposition enhanced Hg(II) uptake. Under
   conditions dominated by chloride complexation, neutral mercury chloride
   species (HgCl2 or MeHgCl) may control the uptake.}},

   matter and its biogeochemical importance}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-66}},
Abstract = {{Bacterial production of humic-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter
   (FDOMH) was examined in a 90 d culture experiment using a bacterial
   assemblage collected from coastal water with artificial seawater amended
   by glucose. A rapid decrease in dissolved organic carbon concentration
   was noticed during Days 1 to 5, and this coincided with an increase in
   bacterial numbers. The increase in FDOMH, which was determined by
   Excitation-Emission Matrix Spectroscopy (EEMS), was observed by Day 20,
   showing the production of FDOMH by bacteria. This increase lagged behind
   the increase in bacterial numbers, suggesting that the production of
   FDOMH was accompanied by an alteration of bacterial biomolecules. After
   Day 30, the fluorescence intensity showed no significant decrease, and
   63\% of the maximum intensity on Day 20 remained at the end of the
   experiment. This high remaining percentage likely reflects the
   recalcitrant properties of bacteria-derived FDOMH (BAC-FDOMH).
   High-performance size-exclusion chromatography with fluorescence
   detection (Excitation/Emission = 335/410 nm) revealed that most of
   BAC-FDOMH is composed of 3 molecular weight (MW) groups having similar
   fluorescent properties. The MWs of these were all <1.8 kDa relative to
   standards with known MW. A photodegradation experiment of BAC-FDOMH
   demonstrated that the photodegradability of fluorophores varied among
   the MW groups. Measurements of the MW composition of coastal seawater
   showed that a recalcitrant fraction of BAC-FDOMH resistant to solar
   irradiance constituted a part of FDOMH in ambient seawater.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate quantification of photo-induced marine processes requires a
   realistic description of UV radiation (UVR) penetration in the surface
   ocean. Remote sensing of ocean color could supply global views of UVR
   attenuation if reliable algorithms were made available. Although a few
   models for the retrieval of UV diffuse attenuation coefficients,
   K-d(lambda), have been proposed in the past, robust and properly
   validated algorithms are still needed. We have developed and validated
   two algorithms for the retrieval of K-d(lambda) at lambda = 320, 340,
   380, 412, 443, 490 nm from multispectral remote-sensing reflectances,
   R-rs(lambda) (SeaWiFS wavebands). These algorithms, SeaUV and SeaUV(C),
   were developed from a large ``training dataset{''} comprising
   simultaneous in situ measurements of R-rs(lambda) and K-d(lambda) made
   in a variety of water types ranging from blue oligotrophic to turbid
   estuarine systems. Four orthogonal dimensions of ocean color defined
   from the original R-rs(lambda) spectra are used as predictors in
   multiple linear regressions of K-d(lambda) to develop the algorithms. In
   the case of SeaUV(C), an optical classification permits the development
   of water-type specific parameterizations. Validation against an
   independent synthetic Hydrolight (R) data set and an in sitar data set
   showed that the algorithms can be used with confidence over the range of
   water types for which they have been developed. SeaUV and SeaUV(C) will
   find applicability in the fields of marine photochemistry and
   photobiology where their performance and inherent simplicity make them
   suitable for batch implementation on large data sets and at global
   scales. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   negative relationship between BP and the photosynthetic response to
   light was observed, leading to a decreased Delta BP:DPP ratio with
   increasing photon flux density. However, when all the data were
   compiled, BP was correlated with DPP and total primary production.
   Assuming bacterial growth efficiencies from 1 to 10\%, bacterial carbon
   demand (BCD) was higher than the supply of DPP in the most oligotrophic
   sites (up to 400 \% of DPP). This implies a weaker linkage between
   bacteria and phytoplankton than previously observed in other
   oligotrophic sites and requires external subsidies of dissolved organic
   carbon. In the coastal sites, characterised by higher inorganic and
   organic matter concentrations, DPP was estimated as being sufficient to
   support BCD, and bacteria and phytoplankton are considered to be
   strongly linked. These results were in contrast to previously published
   results for temperate and polar coastal regions and highlight the
   differences of these often understudied tropical systems.}},

Abstract = {{The possible photolysis of organic copper complexing ligands in marine
   waters is investigated here by irradiation of estuarine waters with
   natural sunlight and with the simulated UV component of sunlight at
   wavelengths of 300-350nm, typical for intermediate latitudes, in an
   incubator. Copper complexing ligands and thiol compounds were determined
   by cathodic stripping voltammetry. Field experiments showed that
   photochemical oxidation of the copper complexing ligands and thiol
   compounds occurred but at variable rates due to variations in the
   sunlight intensity and salinity. Ligand concentrations were decreased by
   between 2\% and 60\%, and thiol concentrations by 30-50\%, by a day
   exposure to sunlight. The incubator experiments confirmed that the thiol
   compounds occurring in the samples were broken down with a half-life of
   3 h and natural copper complexing ligands with a half-life of 20-45 h,
   by the simulated daylight. After saturation with copper, the half-life
   of the thiols increased by nearly a decade. It is possible that L1-type
   ligands, which are nearly saturated with copper, are also broken down
   more slowly than the weaker L2-type ligands. The experiments confirm
   that solar radiation breaks down a significant fraction of copper
   complexing ligands and thiol compounds in surface waters. However, it is
   likely that this photochemical breakdown is much less for ligands
   stabilised by copper, and it is reduced by downward mixing of the
   surface waters and subsequent shading by dissolved organic matter and
   particulate matter in tidal estuarine conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V

Abstract = {{Fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (FDOM) was determined for the
   first time during a complete seasonal cycle in a coastal upwelling
   system (Ria de Vigo, NW Spain). Specific excitation/emission wavelengths
   for the refractory humic substances and the labile aromatic amino acids
   were detected and quantified. The distribution of the fluorescence of
   marine humic substances (FDOMM) correlated significantly with nutrient
   salts (r = 0.62, p < 0.001) and dissolved oxygen (r < -0.71, p < 0.001),
   after removal of the effect of water masses mixing. It suggests that
   humic substances are a by-product of organic matter mineralisation
   processes in shelf bottom waters. It was estimated that about 10\% of
   the organic carbon degraded in the water column was transformed into
   humic substances, which were produced in the ria at a rate of about 0.1
   ppb eq (parts per billion equivalents) quinine sulphate d(-1). The
   distribution of the fluorescence of dissolved aromatic amino acids
   (FDOMT) correlated significantly with the distribution of particulate
   proteins (r > 0.57, p < 0.001). FDOMT can be used to trace sites of net
   accumulation of labile DOM in (1) the photic layer (at a rate of about
   0.5 ppb eq tryptophan d(-1)), where labile DOM is produced from
   phytoplankton exudation and/or lysis and (2) the bottom nepheloid layer
   (at a rate of about 0.2 ppb eq tryptophan d(-1)), due to an in situ
   enhancement of the microbial activity and/or a release from sediment
   pore waters.}},

Abstract = {{Fecal pellets were produced by Acartia tonsa fed C-14-labeled diatom,
   cryptophyte, and dinoflagellate diets, and were incubated in 1.2
   mum-filtered Long Island Sound seawater. Based on the C-14 label, the
   decrease in fpOC (fecal pellet organic carbon), the release and fate of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC), as
   well as bacterial production and enzymatic activity, were followed over
   a 96 h period. fpOC decreased by 9, 14, and 19\% d(-1) in diatom,
   cryptophyte, and dinoflagellate pellets, respectively. There was a fast,
   possibly passive, leakage of DOC from pellets from all 3 diets within a
   few hours after egestion, which may not have been utilized by attached
   bacteria. Bacterial production rates were 17, 12, and 31 pg C pellet(-1)
   h(-1), on diatom, cryptophyte, and dinoflagellate pellets, respectively.
   These were 5 orders of magnitude higher than production rates of
   free-living bacteria, indicating that copepod fecal pellets are hot
   spots of pelagic microbial production. The high production was caused
   primarily by high initial bacterial abundances. Accordingly, production
   and growth were entirely uncoupled in diatom pellets. There were no
   increases in abundance of attached bacteria on any of the 3 diets,
   indicating that the produced bacterial cells were released from the
   fecal pellets. Attached bacteria had a higher ectoenzymatic activity
   than free-living bacteria, but their production and ectoenzymatic
   activity were uncoupled and they only assimilated a minor fraction of
   the released DOC. DOC was therefore released favoring free-living
   microbes. The chitinase activity, which increased several-fold, was
   coupled to the production of attached bacteria; thus, chitin may play an
   important role in bacterial production on copepod fecal pellets.}},

Abstract = {{Although particulate organic carbon (POC) in sediments is derived from
   diverse sources, characteristics of bulk POC are frequently used as
   indicators of the `quality' of organic matter potentially available to
   sedimentary microbial communities. In order to investigate the extent to
   which characteristics of POC relate to sedimentary metabolism, the rates
   of the initial and terminal steps of organic carbon remineralization
   (extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis, and sulfate, iron, and manganese
   reduction, respectively) were compared at three sites in Skagerrak
   dominated by different terminal remineralization processes. In parallel,
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) inventories and bulk POC characteristics
   were assessed. At all three sites, bulk characteristics of POC were
   similar, with C/N close to 12, low sedimentary amino acid content, and
   moderate concentrations of total hydrolyzable carbohydrates. On average,
   just 12\% of POC was characterizable as carbohydrates or amino acids.
   These characteristics are frequently considered typical of unreactive or
   `low quality' organic matter. At all three sites, however, organic
   carbon remineralization (measured as CO2 production and sediment 02
   uptake) was quite high relative to other locations with similar bulk
   characteristics. A comparison of DOC inventories with rates of terminal
   remineralization demonstrated that at the three sites, on average 27, 8,
   and 31\% of the sedimentary DOC pool must be turned over on a daily
   basis in order to support terminal respiration. Extracellular enzymatic
   activity, calculated as potential carbon turnover, was sufficient to
   support these rates. At these sites, standard chemical characterization
   of bulk POC does not reflect the reactivity and availability of
   substrates to the sedimentary microbial community. Carbon
   remineralization is likely fueled by a small fraction of POC, not
   distinguishable by measurement of bulk parameters, which is rapidly
   cycled through the DOC pool. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A model is presented that simulates the formation of marine aggregates
   from particles of different origin inside a model of pelagic biological
   processes. Experiments are carried out with parameterizations
   appropriate for different types of aggregates, using different kinds of
   physical forcing, and compared to observations of dissolved inorganic
   nitrogen (DIN), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), marine snow
   concentration, and sedimentation.
   The occurrence of large, macroscopically visible aggregates (marine
   snow) can best be simulated with parameterizations that have been
   derived from in situ observations of marine snow, but not with a
   parameterization sufficient for dense particles. The parameterization
   strongly determines the amount and timing of deep export, as well as the
   post-bloom development of the food web in the upper layers.
   Detritus in aggregates plays a role mainly during times when zooplankton
   are abundant, as e.g. in the western Arabian Sea during Southwest
   Monsoon. Then the large aggregates as fast sinking vehicles may remove
   detritus quickly from shallow and mid-water depth, preventing the
   accumulation of nutrients that are produced via detritus decomposition.
   In this region, detritus contributes strongly to deep sedimentation. The
   nitrogen budget at this location with regard to the observations cannot
   be closed: depending on model type, either the model simulates too high
   sedimentation, or too high DIN. Possible causes for this mismatch
   include undercollection by sediment traps, inaccurate representation of
   physical processes in the model and the neglect of biological processes,
   such as production of dissolved organic matter or denitrification. (C)

Abstract = {{Bacterial uptake or release of dissolved nitrogen compounds (amino
   nitrogen, urea, ammonium and nitrate) were examined in 0.8 pm filtered
   water from an estuary (Santa Rosa Sound {[}SRS], northwestern Florida)
   and an open-water location in the Gulf of Mexico (GM). The bacterial
   nutrient dynamics were related to oxygen consumption and activity of
   enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation (glutamate dehydrogenase
   {[}GDH], glutamine synthetase {[}GS] and aminopeptidase activity
   {[}leu-MCA]). Dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) were the dominant N
   source to the bacteria, followed by dissolved combined amino acids
   (DCAA), ammonium and nitrate. Nitrogen budgets of the bacteria
   (assimilation of N compounds relative to accumulated N biomass)
   demonstrated that, except for the initial 24 h period in the GM
   cultures, the assimilated N compounds sustained all of the bacterial N
   demand. Urea was released in both sets of cultures, but in the SRS
   cultures the produced urea was reassimilated. Major differences in the
   bacterial N metabolism between the open-water GM and the estuarine SRS
   stations were observed. Relative to the GM station, bacteria in the SRS
   cultures had (1) a 2.4 to 18x higher cell-specific DFAA assimilation,
   (2) a 2.5x higher cell-specific leu-MCA activity, (3) a 3 to 10x higher
   GDH:GS activity ratio and (4) a 1.9 to 4.1x lower cell-specific
   respiration. The larger nutrient availability at the estuarine station
   probably caused these differences in uptake and metabolism of nitrogen
   as well as the lower respiratory rate, relative to the open-water
   station. Therefore, we hypothesize that availability of nitrogen, rather
   than carbon, controlled the bacterial activity in the cultures. Our
   results suggest that bacteria in eutrophic conditions can be more
   important mediators of nitrogen than those in oligotrophic conditions,
   in which bacteria temporarily may immobilize labile nitrogen.}},

Abstract = {{The response of a sediment microbial assemblage to a pulse of diatoms
   was studied over 36 days by measuring bacterial activity and biomass,
   ATP concentration, and overall community respiration in laboratory
   microcosms. Also, the contribution of macrofaunal chironomids to the
   decomposition of settling diatoms in benthic communities, and the
   relative importance of benthic meiofauna in community metabolism, were
   determined.
   The addition of diatoms resulted in an immediate response by sediment
   bacteria, with higher bacterial production recorded after only 2 h, and
   a more than tenfold increase within one day. The rapid response by
   sediment bacteria was accompanied by relatively high initial
   concentrations of dissolved organic carbon. In treatments receiving
   diatoms, higher bacterial production was sustained throughout the
   experiment. Surprisingly, neither these elevated production estimates,
   nor the starvation of controls affected bacterial abundance. Mean
   bacterial cell volume, however, was markedly affected by the addition of
   diatoms. Combining community respiration measurements and bacterial
   production estimates showed that growth efficiencies for sediment
   bacteria ranged from 14.6 to 34.5\%. The contribution of ambient
   meiozoobenthos to carbon metabolism was less than 1\%. Carbon budgets
   showed that 1.3 mg C was cooxidized along with 4.3 mg added diatom C.
   Sediment reworking by Chironomus larvae initially enhanced bacterial
   production, but the presence of Chironomus resulted in lower bacterial
   production estimates after 16 and 36 days. This was interpreted as a
   result of faster decomposition of diatoms in treatments with
   chironomids, which was validated by a faster decline of ATP and
   chlorophyll a in the sediment. Our results indicate that Chironomus
   larvae compete with sediment bacteria for available organic substrates.}},

Title = {{Water quality trends at an upland site in Wales, UK, 1983-1993}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{183-203}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Ten years of detailed upland stream and bulk deposition water quality
   data from Plynlimon, mid-Wales, are examined for trend. A robust
   statistical test (the seasonal Kendall test) is applied and data are
   presented graphically. Smoothing techniques are used to highlight the
   patterns of change which underlie high data scatter. The graphs show
   long-term cycles within the data which violate the assumptions of common
   statistical tests for trend. These cycles relate to fluctuations in the
   weather patterns at Plynlimon. Even though the seasonal Kendall test is
   significant for some determinands, the evidence from the graphs suggests
   that many of these `trends' are unlikely to continue.
   For solutes in rainfall, there is no convincing long-term trend. There
   is a possible increase in ammonium concentrations, which may indicate an
   increasing atmospheric source generated by farming activities, but this
   will require a longer data series for confirmation. Several trace metal
   concentrations increased significantly part way through the study
   period, but later returned to the original levels. The bulk
   precipitation sea salt input has been uneven over the 10-year sampling
   period, with the highest inputs occurring during the wetter winters.
   For solutes in streamwaters, there are clear trends in dissolved organic
   carbon (DOG), iodine and bromide, which increase over time and may be
   attributed to an increase in organic decomposition in the catchment.
   Previous studies in Wales have shown similar behaviour for colour, which
   is related to DOG, but the corresponding changes for bromide and iodine
   are new. For most other streamwater determinands, any changes are masked
   by the effects of year to year variations in the quality and quantity of
   rainfall. For example, zinc and chromium variations parallel the
   corresponding rainfall quantity variations. The effect of rainfall
   quality variation is marked for marine-derived elements such as
   chloride. For sulphate, streamwater variations are inverted relative to
   chloride. This suggests that dry deposition may vary with weather
   conditions: high when the wind direction is from the land and low when
   weather systems are predominantly frontal and laden with sea salts.
   Alternatively, high sea salt rainfall may be affecting
   absorption/solubility reactions in the soils.
   There are four main conclusions. Firstly, there is no indication of
   changing acid deposition inputs or changing acidity within the runoff,
   despite a decline in UK sulphur dioxide emissions. Secondly, streamwater
   DOC has shown an increase over time, but there is no clear corresponding
   decrease in pH as might be expected from acidification theory. Thirdly,
   there are cyclical variations in bulk precipitation inputs and in
   streamwater quality, which mean that trends cannot be established even
   with 10 years of data. Long-term cycles are likely to exist in other
   environmental data and extreme care is required for the interpretation
   of trend, especially if data sets are short. This aspect strongly
   supports the continuation of long-term monitoring programmes over
   several decades. Finally, the graphical application strongly enhances
   data analysis and should be considered an essential component of trend
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The organic carbon of 280-320 m deep Laurentian Trough sediments at
   landward and seaward sites (13-24 mg C/g) consisted of carbohydrates
   (15-22\%), hydrolysable amino acids (7-13\%), lipids (1-5\%), labile
   proteins (0.3-1\%) and a non-characterized fraction (62-74\%). Amino
   acids, proteins and uncharacterized compounds accounted for 21-43, 0.9-4
   and 51-78\%, respectively, of total nitrogen (1.2-2.2 mgN/g). A clear
   reactivity trend (pheopigments much greater than lipids > proteins >
   amino acids approximate to nitrogen > carbon > carbohydrates) was
   deduced from the concentration decreases between settling particles and
   surficial sediments. This was confirmed by one-year inventories in the
   top cm, burial rates at 35 cm depth, and one-G model calculations.
   Lipids were a dominant substrate near the sediment-water interface
   whereas carbohydrates and amino acids constituted the principal energy
   sources deeper in the sediment. In the porewaters, DOC levels were low
   (2-6 mg/l) in the top 4 cm, indicating rapid removal (i.e. consumption,
   irrigation, diffusion), and increased with depth (8-12 mg/l), reflecting
   the buildup of refractory products. There were also clear compositional
   changes of DOC with depth. Geographical differences in water column
   fluxes were recorded in the sediments. The organic contents and C/N
   ratios were higher at the landward site due to higher rates of
   sedimentation, bioturbation and terrestrial and total organic inputs. At
   the seaward station, the lower rates of these processes and stronger
   marine influence resulted in lower C/N ratios and a more complete decay
   of organic matter within the top 35 cm sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory radiotracer experiments compared the effects of zooplankton
   grazing and microbial decomposition on the release of organic C and Ag,
   Cd, Co, Pb and Po from phytoplankton cells. After 40 h incubation of
   diatoms with copepods + microorganisms, 70 \% of the diatom cellular C
   was remineralized to CO2 (40 \%), assimilated in copepod tissue (20 \%),
   excreted in fecal pellets (5 \%) or released as DOC (5 \%);
   microorganisms alone removed half this amount of diatom C. Copepod
   grazing enhanced the conversion of Ag from diatom cells to other forms
   (particulate and dissolved) by 27 \%, Po by 25 \%, Pb by 20 \%, Cd by 13
   \% and Co by 10 \% over those cells incubated with only microorganisms;
   zooplankton grazing increased by 5 to 15 \% the release of elements from
   diatom cells into the dissolved phase. Decomposing copepod fecal
   pellets, held free-falling on a spinning wheel, lost about 20 \% more C,
   Ag, Co and Pb than did undisturbed fecal pellets, while no appreciable
   difference was observed for release of metals from copepod carcasses
   treated similarly. The results suggest that retention of an element
   contained primarily in the cytoplasm of phytoplankton cells (such as C
   or Cd) is largely governed by microbial activity and leaching. Microbial
   activity has a smaller effect on particle-reactive elements (Ag and Pb)
   bound to structural components of cells; zooplankton are effective in
   removing these unassimilable elements by grazing and packaging them into
   rapidly sinking fecal pellets.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an essential role in
   biogeochemical cycling and transport of organic matter throughout the
   hydrological continuum. To characterise microbially-derived organic
   matter (OM) from common environmental microorganisms (Escherichia coli,
   Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), excitation-emission
   matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy was employed. This work shows
   that bacterial organisms can produce fluorescent organic matter (FOM) in
   situ and, furthermore, that the production of FOM differs at a bacterial
   species level. This production can be attributed to structural
   biological compounds, specific functional proteins (e.g. pyoverdine
   production by P. aeruginosa), and/or metabolic by-products. Bacterial
   growth curve data demonstrates that the production of FOM is
   fundamentally related to microbial metabolism. For example, the majority
   of Peak T fluorescence (>75\%) is shown to be intracellular in origin,
   as a result of the building of proteins for growth and metabolism. This
   underpins the use of Peak T as a measure of microbial activity, as
   opposed to bacterial enumeration as has been previously suggested. This
   study shows that different bacterial species produce a range of FOM that
   has historically been attributed to high molecular weight allochthonous
   material or the degradation of terrestrial FOM. We provide definitive
   evidence that, in fact, it can be produced by microbes within a model
   system (autochthonous), providing new insights into the possible origin
   of allochthonous and autochthonous organic material present in aquatic
   systems. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important in
   transforming the chemical composition of the large pool of
   terrestrially-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported from land
   to water annually. However, due to the challenges inherent in isolating
   the effects of individual ROS on DOM composition, the role of ROS in the
   photochemical alteration of DOM remains poorly characterized. In this
   work, terrestrial DOM was independently exposed to singlet oxygen
   (O-1(2)), and superoxide (O-2(-center dot) under controlled laboratory
   conditions). Using ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry to track
   molecular level alterations of DOM by ROS, these findings suggest
   exposure to O-1(2) (generated using Rose Bengal and visible light)
   removed formulas with an O/C > 0.3, and primarily resulted in DOM
   comprised of formulas with higher oxygen content, while O-2(-center dot)
   exposure (from KO2 in DMSO) removed formulas with O/C < 0.3 and produced
   aliphatic formulas (H/C > 1.5). Comparison of DOM altered by ROS in this
   study to riverine and coastal DOM showed that (20-80\%) overlap in
   formulas, providing evidence for the role of ROS in shaping the
   composition of DOM exported from rivers to oceans. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary has experienced severe hypoxia since
   the 1950s. In order to investigate potential ecological functions of key
   microorganisms in relation to hypoxia, we performed 16S rRNA-based
   Illumina Miseq sequencing to explore the bacterial diversity in the
   surface sediments of the hypoxic zone near the Changjiang Estuary and in
   the East China Sea (ECS). The results showed that numerous
   Proteobacteria-affiliated sequences in the sediments of the inner
   continental shelf were related to both sulfate-reducing and
   sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, suggesting an active sulfur cycle in this
   area. Many sequences retrieved from the hypoxic zone were also related
   to Planctomycetes from two marine upwelling systems, which may be
   involved in the initial breakdown of sulfated heteropolysaccharides.
   Bacteroidetes, which is expected to degrade high-molecular-weight
   organic matter, was abundant in all the studied stations except for
   station A8, which was the deepest and possessed the largest grain size.
   In addition, dissolved organic carbon, water depth, percentage ratio of
   clay to silt, salinity, and sedimentary grain size were environmental
   effectors that shaped the sedimentary microbial community structure. Our
   results showed that putative Gammaproteobacteria-affiliated
   sulfur-oxidizing bacteria may not only detoxify hydrogen sulfide
   produced by sulfate-reducing prokaryotes, but also serve as the primary
   producers in the marine sediments. Specific groups of aerobic
   Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes participated in degrading organic
   matter, which might contribute to the oxygen depletion in the hypoxic
   zones.}},

Title = {{Optical Proxies for Terrestrial Dissolved Organic Matter in Estuaries
   and Coastal Waters}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) absorbance and fluorescence were used as
   optical proxies to track terrestrial DOM fluxes through estuaries and
   coastal waters by comparing models developed for several coastal
   ecosystems. Key to using these optical properties is validating and
   calibrating them with chemical measurements, such as lignin-derived
   phenols- a proxy to quantify terrestrial DOM. Utilizing parallel factor
   analysis (PARAFAC), and comparing models statistically using the
   OpenFluor database (http://www.openfluor.org ) we have found common,
   ubiquitous fluorescing components which correlate most strongly with
   lignin phenol concentrations in several estuarine and coastal
   environments. Optical proxies for lignin were computed for the following
   regions: Mackenzie River Estuary, Atchafalaya River Estuary (ARE),
   Charleston Harbor, Chesapeake Bay, and Neuse River Estuary (NRE) (all in
   North America). The slope of linear regression models relating CDOM
   absorption at 350 nm (a(350)) to DOC and to lignin, varied 5-10-fold
   among systems. Where seasonal observations were available from a region,
   there were distinct seasonal differences in equation parameters for
   these optical proxies. The variability appeared to be due primarily to
   river flow into these estuaries and secondarily to biogeochemical
   cycling of DOM within them. Despite the variability, overall models
   using single linear regression were developed that related dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) concentration to CDOM (DOC = 40 +/- 2 x a(350) +
   138 +/- 16; R-2 = 0.77; N = 130) and lignin (Sigma(8)) to CDOM (Sigma(8
   )= 2.03 +/- 0.07 x a(350)- 0.47 +/- 0.59; R-2 = 0.87; N = 130). This
   wide variability suggested that local or regional optical models should
   be developed for predicting terrestrial DOM flux into coastal oceans and
   taken into account when upscaling to remote sensing observations and
   calibrations.}},

Abstract = {{The direct respiration of sinking organic matter by attached bacteria is
   often invoked as the dominant sink for settling particles in the
   mesopelagic ocean. However, other processes, such as enzymatic
   solubilization and mechanical disaggregation, also contribute to
   particle flux attenuation by transferring organic matter to the water
   column. Here we use observations from the North Atlantic Ocean, coupled
   to sensitivity analyses of a simple model, to assess the relative
   importance of particle-attached microbial respiration compared to the
   other processes that can degrade sinking particles. The observed carbon
   fluxes, bacterial production rates, and respiration by water column and
   particle-attached microbial communities each spanned more than an order
   of magnitude. Rates of substrate-specific respiration on sinking
   particle material ranged from 0.0070.003 to 0.1730.105day(-1). A
   comparison of these substrate-specific respiration rates with model
   results suggested sinking particle material was transferred to the water
   column by various biological and mechanical processes nearly 3.5times as
   fast as it was directly respired. This finding, coupled with strong
   metabolic demand imposed by measurements of water column respiration
   (729.3266.0mgCm(-2)d(-1), on average, over the 50 to 150m depth
   interval), suggested a large fraction of the organic matter evolved from
   sinking particles ultimately met its fate through subsequent
   remineralization in the water column. At three sites, we also measured
   very low bacterial growth efficiencies and large discrepancies between
   depth-integrated mesopelagic respiration and carbon inputs.}},

Title = {{From Fresh to Marine Waters: Characterization and Fate of Dissolved
   Organic Matter in the Lena River Delta Region, Siberia}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Connectivity between the terrestrial and marine environment in the Artic
   is changing as a result of climate change, influencing both freshwater
   budgets, and the supply of carbon to the sea. This study characterizes
   the optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) within the Lena
   Delta region and evaluates the behavior of DOM across the fresh
   water-marine gradient. Six fluorescent components (four humic-like; one
   marine humic-like; one protein-like) were identified by Parallel Factor
   Analysis (PARAFAC) with a clear dominance of allochthonous humic-like
   signals. Colored DOM (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were
   highly correlated and had their distribution coupled with hydrographical
   conditions. Higher DOM concentration and degree of humification were
   associated with the low salinity waters of the Lena River. Values
   decreased toward the higher salinity Laptev Sea shelf waters. Results
   demonstrate different responses of DOM mixing in relation to the
   vertical structure of the water column, as reflecting the hydrographical
   dynamics in the region. Two mixing curves for DOM were apparent. In
   surface waters above the pycnocline there was a sharper decrease in DOM
   concentration in relation to salinity indicating removal. In the bottom
   water layer the DOM decrease within salinity was less. We propose there
   is a removal of DOM occurring primarily at the surface layer, which is
   likely driven by photodegradation and flocculation.}},

Abstract = {{Photodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM), collected from two
   upstream and one downstream sites in the Lake Biwa watershed in Japan,
   was investigated using fluorescence properties of three-dimensional
   excitation emission matrix (3-D EEM). Solar irradiation caused a
   decrease in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and in the
   fluorescence peak intensity (FI) of fulvic acid (FA)- and protein-like
   substances in DOM. Mineralization of DOC during an irradiation period
   (13 days) was observed to be higher in upstream samples (32-36\%)
   compared to that in downstream sample (16\%). DOC concentration in
   samples stored in the dark significantly decreased in the downstream
   sample (16\%), while those in upstream samples hardly decreased (1-8\%).
   The FI of FA-like substance decreased by 72-84\% during 13-days
   irradiation (integrated solar intensity = 176 MJ m(-2)). The
   protein-like fluorescence was only observed in the downstream sample and
   the net decrease in the FI was 59\% in the irradiated sample. The
   first-order reaction kinetics was applied to analyze the photo
   degradation of DOM. Two-step photodegradation was suggested for the
   fluorescent DOM (FDOM), while not for the DOC. Results obtained here
   suggested that FA-like FDOM is more susceptible to photodegradation
   compared with those of protein-like substances and DOC.}},

Abstract = {{A diagenetic reaction-transport model was used to simulate how the
   sediment redox boundary migrates in response to persistent or episodic
   changes in the deposition flux of degradable organic matter and, the
   concentration of oxygen in the overlying bottom water. The position of
   the redox boundary is represented by the depth of oxygen penetration.
   The simulations reveal that the position of the redox boundary in
   organic-poor sediments, such as those in the deep basins of the Arctic
   Ocean, is highly sensitive to the flux of organic matter: relatively
   small and/or brief increases in that flux can cause the redox boundary
   to migrate rapidly from deep within the sediment to within a few
   centimeters of the sediment-water interface. Reoxidation of the sediment
   column after such an event can take years. Redox fluctuations can
   redistribute solid-phase manganese within the sediment column and
   produce multiple concentration peaks in its depth profile on a decadal
   time scale. Manganese peaks observed in sediment cores from the deep
   basins of the Arctic Ocean do not necessarily correspond to the position
   of the redox boundary during previous climatic periods or reflect
   historical changes in manganese deposition rates. The model supports the
   hypothesis that the recent decrease in the Arctic ice cover has
   increased the flux of organic matter to the seafloor and moved the redox
   boundary close to the sediment-water interface. The presence of iron
   sulfides at depths significantly below the bioturbated layer suggests
   that either the Arctic sediments have been anoxic for millennia, or iron

Title = {{A comparison of N and C uptake during brown tide (Aureococcus

Abstract = {{Blooms of the brown tide pelagophyte, Aureococcus anophagefferens, have
   been reported in coastal bays along the east coast of the USA for nearly
   two decades. Blooms appear-to be constrained to shallow bays that have
   low flushing rates, little riverine input and high salinities (e.g.,
   >28). Nutrient enrichment and coastal eutrophication has been most
   frequently implicated as the cause of A. anophagefferens and other
   blooms in coastal bays. We compare N and C dynamics during two brown
   tide blooms, one in Quantuck Bay, on Long Island, NY in 2000, and the
   other in Chincoteague Bay, at Public Landing, MD in 2002, with a
   physically similar site in Chincoteague Bay that did not experience a
   bloom. We found that the primary forms of nitrogen (N) taken up during
   the bloom in Quantuck Bay were ammonium and dissolved free amino acids
   (DFAA) while the primary form of N fueling production at both sites in
   Chincoteague Bay was urea. At both Chincoteague sites, amino acid carbon
   (C) was taken up while urea C was not. Even though A. anophagefferens
   has the ability to take up organic C, during the bloom at Chincoteague
   Bay, photosynthetic uptake of bicarbonate was the dominant pathway of C
   acquisition by the >1.2 alpham size fraction during the day. C uptake by
   cells <5.0 alpham was insufficient to meet cellular C demand based on
   the measured N uptake rates and the C:N ratio of particulate material.
   While cells >1.2 alpham did not take up much organic C during the day,
   smaller cells (>0.2 alpham) did. Peptide hydrolysis appeared to play an
   important role in mobilizing organic matter in Quantuck Bay, where amino
   acids contributed substantially to N and C uptake, but not in
   Chincoteague Bay. Dissolved organic N (DON), dissolved organic C (DOC)
   concentrations and the DOC/DON ratio were higher and total dissolved
   inorganic N (DIN) concentrations were lower at the bloom site in
   Chincoteague Bay than at the nonbloom site in the same bay. We conclude
   that A. anophagefferens is capable of using a wide variety of N and C
   compounds, and that nutrient inputs, biotic interactions and the
   dominant recycling pathways determine which compounds are available and
   which metabolic pathways are active at a particular site. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Fifteen European rivers and streams belonging to watersheds in Sweden,
   the Netherlands, and Spain respectively, were sampled by allowing
   periphyton to colonize submerged glass substrata. Their zinc tolerances
   were quantified in short-term laboratory tests, where inhibition of
   photosynthesis in microalgae and thymidine incorporation in bacterial
   DNA was measured, and expressed as EC50 values. The variability in zinc
   tolerances was high reaching 1.5-2.5 orders of magnitude, ranging from
   25-8145 muM for photosynthesis and 15467 muM for thymidine assays. Based
   on the observed variability, uncertainty factors were estimated for the
   extrapolation of zinc toxicity data from river to river, both regionally
   and interregionally. Under the assumption to protect 95\% of the
   observed communities the regional uncertainty factors were 1.7-4.3 and
   the interregional 2.4-8.6. The sampling sites were characterized in
   terms of biotope physiography, water chemistry, periphyton biomass,
   trace element content, and species composition. Multivariate analysis of
   the data using PLS (Projection to Latent Structure), was used to
   generate hypotheses about the relation between periphyton zinc tolerance
   and the 123 so-called predictor variables. Zinc contamination,
   phosphate, nitrogen nutrients, pH, calcium, bicarbonate, dissolved
   organic carbon, and various diatom species are important predictors for
   zinc tolerance in the entire data set representing all 15 river
   stretches. Regional models suggested that very different factors
   determined the zinc tolerance in the Swedish and Dutch periphyton. The
   results are interpreted in terms of Pollution-Induced Community
   Tolerance (PICT) and the bioavailability of zinc.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of natural surface solar radiation on the biological removal
   of dimethylsulfo-niopropionate (DMSP) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) was
   determined and compared to the photochemical removal of DMSP and DMS.
   Natural bacterial assemblages (0.8 mum filtered seawater) from the
   northern Adriatic Sea and the coastal North Sea were exposed to surface
   solar radiation and incubated in the dark; the DMSP and DMS
   concentrations were measured concurrently. Photochemical removal rates
   were determined in 0.2 mum filtered seawater. Biological removal of DMSP
   in the light was 62 +/- 14\% lower than the biological removal rate
   obtained in the dark. High spatial and temporal variability in the
   biological removal rates was observed for the dark treatments, as well
   as for its sensivity to solar radiation, with rates for light treatments
   varying from 29 to 81\% of those in the dark. The DMSP concentration
   above which no further increase of the biological DMSP removal rate was
   observed was substantially lower in the light treatments (similar to 30
   nM) than in the dark treatments (> 80 nM). UV-B radiation only accounted
   for a minor inhibitory effect (similar to 15\% of total inhibition),
   whereas UV-A and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) both
   contributed similar to 42\% of total inhibition. Biological DMS removal
   under solar radiation was only similar to 40 +/- 14\% of the biological
   DMSremoval in the dark, Under surface solar radiation, photochemical
   removal was always higher than the dark biological removal. Our results
   indicate therefore, that the DMSP and DMS dynamics in the oceanic
   surface waters are severely influenced by solar radiation due to the
   partial inhibition of the microbial consortia responsible for DMSP and
   DMS turnover.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic iodine (DOI) in inshore waters was decomposed by solar

Abstract = {{Results of recent studies of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in
   Chesapeake Bay sediment pore waters are summarized here, to gain further
   insights into the controls on the composition and reactivity of
   estuarine pore water DOM. This analysis shows that much of the DOM
   accumulating in sediment pore waters appears to be refractory and of
   relatively low molecular weight (less than similar to3 kDa), consistent
   with recent water column DOM studies. Comparative analyses of pore water
   DOM data from bioturbated/bioirrigated sediments versus anoxic (i.e.
   non-bioturbated/bioirrigated) sediments indicate that differences in the
   physical and biogeochemical processes in these sediments lead to
   distinct differences in DOM concentrations and composition. The
   causative factors here appear to be both the presence/absence of
   macrofauna in the sediments, as well as differences in sediment redox
   conditions (more strictly anoxic vs. ``mixed{''} redox conditions).
   These observations further suggest that differences in DOM composition
   and reactivity as a result of varying sediment redox conditions might
   also play a role in how sediment redox conditions affect overall
   sediment carbon preservation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   Limited's copper mine in Queenstown, Australia, has resulted in the

   preliminary risk assessment, together with chemical measurements of
   dissolved copper, ASV-labile copper, copper complexing capacity and
   resin-adsorbed copper, suggested that copper in mid-salinity harbour
   waters was potentially bioavailable. However, toxicity tests based on
   inhibition of microalgal (Nitzschia closterium) growth showed that
   copper in these waters was not toxic, even though labile copper
   concentrations (6-24 mu g L-1) exceeded the concentration of lowest
   observable effect for algae of 5 mu g L-1. Measurements of intracellular
   and membrane-bound copper confirmed that cell division was not affected
   because copper was not taken up intracellularly. Amelioration of copper
   toxicity was due to binding of dissolved organic matter and/or other
   metals at the cell membrane, preventing copper binding and uptake. An
   understanding of the mechanism of copper toxicity and its amelioration
   is vital to assessing various clean-up options for the harbour.}},

Abstract = {{Water column profiles of DOC and DON were determined using the
   high-temperature catalytic oxidation method Of SUZUKI et al. (Deep-Sea
   Research, 39, 185-198, 1992) during three cruises to Santa Monica Basin
   in the Southern California Bight. DOC concentrations ranged from a
   minimum of 62 muM at 600 m to a maximum of 103 muM at 30 m. Most
   near-surface concentrations were in the range of 90-98 muM. These
   concentrations were only 20-30 muM greater than previous estimates using
   wet oxidation techniques, the difference perhaps in part due to an
   unquantified system blank. DON concentrations ranged from 1.0 to 9.6 muM
   with little evidence of a gradient with depth. This concentration range
   overlaps existing estimates for the region using photo-oxidation
   methods. Mean atomic C:N ratios in the dissolved organic pool for the
   entire water column ranged from 16 to 38, the higher value likely an
   overestimate due to anomalously low DON values at depth in July. There
   was no apparent trend in the ratio with depth. During a diel study in
   July. changes in the concentrations of DOC in the surface 50 m occurred
   mostly within the precision of the analysis. DON concentrations did not
   vary above the nutricline but large changes occurred at the top of the
   nutricline. Significantly, these changes did not covary with changes in
   inorganic nitrogen, implying a non-conservative nature for DON in that
   portion of the water column. No correlation was evident between DOC and
   AOU concentrations, but a correlation did exist between salinity and
   AOU. suggesting that mixing is the dominant mechanism controlling the
   distribution of AOU in Santa Monica Basin. These results do not support
   extending the conclusions Of SUZUKI et al. (Marine Chemistry, 16, 83-97,
   1985) and SUGIMURA and SUZUKI (Marine Chemistry, 24, 105-131, 1988)

   strong correlation between DOC and AOU, near-surface TDN concentrations

Abstract = {{The toxicity that contaminated sediments may introduce into the water
   column has not been measured extensively. In order to quantify this
   potential toxicity, the seawater overlying two uncontaminated and three
   contaminated marine sediments was evaluated in the laboratory with the
   sea urchin Arbacia punctulata fertilization test. Concentrations of
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and copper, as representative
   contaminants, were also measured. To characterize sources of toxicity,
   samples were chemically manipulated using reversed-phase chromatography,
   cation exchange, and chelation. Water column toxicity and contaminant
   concentrations were higher in the suspended exposures than in bedded
   exposures. Interstitial water toxicity and contaminant concentrations
   were generally greater than either bedded or suspended exposures.
   Chemical manipulation indicated that the observed toxicity in water
   column exposures was probably caused by metallic and/or nonionic organic
   contaminants. Conversely, manipulation of interstitial waters did not
   result in significantly reduced toxicity, suggesting that other
   toxicants such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be active.}},

Abstract = {{Marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the largest active
   reservoirs of reduced carbon on Earth. In the deep ocean, DOC has been
   described as biologically recalcitrant and has a radiocarbon age of
   4,000 to 6,000 years, which far exceeds the timescale of ocean
   overturning. However, abiotic removal mechanisms cannot account for the
   full magnitude of deep-ocean DOC loss. Deep-ocean water circulates at
   low temperatures through volcanic crust on ridge flanks, but little is
   known about the associated biogeochemical processes and carbon cycling.
   Here we present analyses of DOC in fluids from two borehole
   observatories installed in crustal rocks west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,
   and show that deep-ocean DOC is removed from these cool circulating
   fluids. The removal mechanism is isotopically selective and causes a
   shift in specific features of molecular composition, consistent with
   microbe-mediated oxidation. We suggest organic molecules with an average
   radiocarbon age of 3,200 years are bioavailable to crustal microbes, and
   that this removal mechanism may account for at least 5\% of the global
   loss of DOC in the deep ocean. Cool crustal circulation probably
   contributes to maintaining the deep ocean as a reservoir of `aged' and
   refractory DOC by discharging the surviving organic carbon constituents
   that are molecularly degraded and depleted in C-14 and C-13 into the
   deep ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon uptake and partitioning of two globally abundant diatom species,
   Thalassiosira weissflogii and Dactyliosolen fragilissimus, was
   investigated in batch culture experiments under four conditions: ambient
   (15 degrees C, 400 atm), high CO2 (15 degrees C, 1000 atm), high
   temperature (20 degrees C, 400 atm), and combined (20 degrees C, 1000
   atm). The experiments were run from exponential growth into the
   stationary phase (six days after nitrogen depletion), allowing us to
   track biogeochemical dynamics analogous to bloom situations in the
   ocean. Elevated CO2 had a fertilizing effect and enhanced uptake of
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by about 8\% for T. weissflogii and by
   up to 39\% for D. fragilissimus. This was also reflected in higher cell
   numbers, build-up of particulate and dissolved organic matter, and
   transparent exopolymer particles. The CO2 effects were most prominent in
   the stationary phase when nitrogen was depleted and CO2(aq)
   concentrations were low. This indicates that diatoms in the high CO2
   treatments could take up more DIC until CO2 concentrations in seawater
   became so low that carbon limitation occurs. These results suggest that,
   contrary to common assumptions, diatoms could be highly sensitive to
   ongoing changes in oceanic carbonate chemistry, particularly under
   nutrient limitation. Warming from 15 to 20 degrees C had a stimulating
   effect on one species but acted as a stressor on the other species,
   highlighting the importance of species-specific physiological optima and
   temperature ranges in the response to ocean warming. Overall, these
   sensitivities to CO2 and temperature could have profound impacts on
   diatoms blooms and the biological pump.}},

   Off-Shore Mesocosm Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Marine bacteria are the main consumers of freshly produced organic
   matter. Many enzymatic processes involved in the bacterial digestion of
   organic compounds were shown to be pH sensitive in previous studies. Due
   to the continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration, seawater pH is
   presently decreasing at a rate unprecedented during the last 300 million
   years but the consequences for microbial physiology, organic matter
   cycling and marine biogeochemistry are still unresolved. We studied the
   effects of elevated seawater pCO(2) on a natural plankton community
   during a large-scale mesocosm study in a Norwegian fjord. Nine Kiel
   Off-Shore Mesocosms for Future Ocean Simulations (KOSMOS) were adjusted
   to different pCO(2) levels ranging initially from ca. 280 to 3000 mu atm
   and sampled every second day for 34 days. The first phytoplankton bloom
   developed around day 5. On day 14, inorganic nutrients were added to the
   enclosed, nutrient-poor waters to stimulate a second phytoplankton
   bloom, which occurred around day 20. Our results indicate that marine
   bacteria benefit directly and indirectly from decreasing seawater pH.
   During the first phytoplankton bloom, 5-10\% more transparent exopolymer
   particles were formed in the high pCO(2) mesocosms. Simultaneously, the
   efficiency of the protein-degrading enzyme leucine aminopeptidase
   increased with decreasing pH resulting in up to three times higher
   values in the highest pCO(2)/lowest pH mesocosm compared to the
   controls. In general, total and cell-specific aminopeptidase activities
   were elevated under low pH conditions. The combination of enhanced
   enzymatic hydrolysis of organic matter and increased availability of gel
   particles as substrate supported up to 28\% higher bacterial abundance
   in the high pCO(2) treatments. We conclude that ocean acidification has
   the potential to stimulate the bacterial community and facilitate the
   microbial recycling of freshly produced organic matter, thus
   strengthening the role of the microbial loop in the surface ocean.}},

Abstract = {{The viral mediated transformation of phytoplankton organic carbon to
   dissolved forms ({''}viral shunt{''}) has been suggested as a major
   source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in marine systems. Despite the
   potential implications of viral activity on the global carbon fluxes,
   studies investigating changes in the DOC composition from viral lysis is
   still lacking. Micromonas pusilla is an ecologically relevant
   picoeukaryotic phytoplankter, widely distributed in both coastal and
   oceanic marine waters. Viruses have been found to play a key role in
   regulating the population dynamics of this species. In this study we
   used axenic cultures of exponentially growing M. pusilla to determine
   the impact of viral lysis on the DOC concentration and composition, as
   estimated from lysate-derived production of transparent exopolymer
   particles (TEP) and two fractions of fluorescent dissolved organic
   matter (DOM): aromatic amino acids (excitation/emission; 280/320 nm;
   F(280/320)) and marine humic-like fluorescent DOM (320/410 nm;
   F(320/410)). DOC concentration increased 4.5 times faster and reached
   2.6 times higher end concentration in the viral infected compared with
   the non-infected cultures. The production of F(280/320) and F(320/410)
   were 4.1 and 2.8 times higher in the infected cultures, and the elevated
   ratio between F(280/320) and F(320/410) in lysates suggested a higher
   contribution of labile (protein) components in viral produced DOM than
   in algal exudates. The TEP production was 1.8 times faster and reached a
   1.5 times higher level in the viral infected M. pusilla culture compared
   with the non- infected cultures. The measured increase in both DOC and
   TEP concentrations suggests that viral lysis has multiple and opposite
   implications for the production and export processes in the pelagic
   ocean: (1) by releasing host biomass as DOC it decreases the organic
   matter sedimentation and promotes respiration and nutrient retention in
   the photic zone, whereas (2) the observed enhanced TEP production could
   stimulate particle aggregation and thus carbon export out of the photic
   zone.}},

   necessitated an assessment of their contributions to sea-level rise and
   the potential release of nutrients to nearby aquatic environments. In
   particular, the release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from glacier
   melt could stimulate microbial activity in both glacial ecosystems and
   adjacent watersheds, but this would largely depend on the composition of
   the material released. Using fluorescence and H-1 NMR spectroscopy, we
   characterize DOM at its natural abundance in unaltered samples from a
   number of glaciers that differ in geographic location, thermal regime,
   and sample depth. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling of DOM
   fluorophores identifies components in the ice that are predominantly
   proteinaceous in character, while H-1 NMR spectroscopy reveals a mixture
   of small molecules that likely originate from native microbes.
   Spectrofluorescence also reveals a terrestrial contribution that was
   below the detection limits of NMR; however, H-1 nuclei From levoglucosan
   was identified in Arctic glacier ice samples. This study suggests that
   the bulk of the DOM from these glaciers is a mixture of biologically
   labile molecules derived from microbes.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to oceanic
   metal budgets is only beginning to be explored. Here, we demonstrate
   that biogeochemical processes in a northern Florida subterranean estuary
   (STE) significantly alter U and Ba concentrations entering the coastal
   ocean via SGD. Tidal pumping controlled the distribution of dissolved
   metals in shallow beach groundwater. Hourly observations of intertidal
   groundwaters revealed high U and low Ba concentrations at high tide as a
   result of seawater infiltration into the coastal aquifer. During ebb
   tide. U decreased and Ba increased due to freshwater dilution and, more
   importantly, biogeochemical reactions that removed U and added Ba to
   solution. U removal was apparently a result of precipitation following
   the reduction of U(VI) to U(IV). A significant correlation between Ba
   and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in shallow beach groundwaters implied
   a common source, likely the mineralization of marine particulate organic
   matter driven into the beach face by tidal pumping. In deeper
   groundwaters, where the labile organic matter had been depleted, Ba
   correlated with Mn. We estimate that net SGD fluxes were -163 and + 1660
   mu mol m(-1) d(-1) for U and Ba, respectively (or -1 and +8 mu mol m(-2)
   d(-1) if a 200-m wide seepage area is considered). Our results support
   the emerging concept that subterranean estuaries are natural
   biogeochemical reactors where metal concentrations are altered relative
   to conservative mixing between terrestrial and marine endmembers. These
   deviations from conservative mixing significantly influence SGD-derived
   trace metal fluxes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Copper appears to be influencing the distribution and abundance of
   phytoplankton in marine environments, and cyanobacteria are thought to
   be the most sensitive of the phytoplankton groups to copper toxicity. By
   using growth assays of phylogenetically divergent clades, we found that
   coastal strains of marine Synechococcus species were more tolerant to
   copper shock than open-ocean strains. The global transcriptional
   response to two levels of copper shock were determined for both a
   coastal strain and an open-ocean strain of marine Synechococcus species
   using whole-genome expression microarrays. Both strains showed an
   osmoregulatory-like response, perhaps as a result of increasing membrane
   permeability. This could have implications for marine carbon cycling if
   copper shock leads to dissolved organic carbon leakage in Synechococcus
   species. The two strains additionally showed a common reduction in
   levels of photosynthesis-related gene transcripts. Contrastingly, the
   open-ocean strain showed a general stress response, whereas the coastal
   strain exhibited a more specifically oxidative or heavy-metal
   acclimation response that may be conferring tolerance. In addition, the
   coastal strain activated more regulatory elements and transporters, many
   of which are not conserved in other marine Synechococcus strains and may
   have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Thus, tolerance to
   copper shock in some marine Synechococcus strains may in part be a
   result of a generally increased ability to sense and respond in a more
   stress-specific manner.}},

Abstract = {{A two-step protocol (nano-filtration and reverse osmosis) was applied
   for natural organic matter (NOM) preconcentration of a seawater sample.
   Complexing affinities of the so concentrated marine dissolved NOM (DNOM)
   towards major and trace cations were studied by potentiometric and
   voltammetric titration techniques. The potentiometric titration
   experiments fitted by models describing and characterising the
   DNOM-cation interactions, revealed four distinct classes of acidic sites
   (pKa of 3.6, 4.8, 8.6 and 12). A total acidic sites density of 445
   meq/mol(C) was estimated, with a majority (60\%) of carboxylic-like
   sites. Pseudopolarographic measurements revealed two distinct groups of
   copper complexes: labile, reducible at about -0.2 V; and inert, directly
   reducible at about -1.4 V. Simultaneous competition between copper,
   calcium and proton highlighted the presence of two classes of binding
   sites (density of 1.72 and 10.25 meq mol(C)(-1), respectively,
   corresponding to 3\% of total acidic sites). The first class was more
   specific to copper (log K-CuL 9-9, logK(CaL) 2.5, pKa 8.6), whereas
   stronger competition between copper and calcium occurred for the second
   class (log K-CuL 6.9, log K-CaL 5.5, pKa 8.2).
   The binding sites characterisation was validated by the very good
   matching of the non-concentrated seawater sample titration data with the
   simulated curves obtained using the binding parameters from the
   concentrated sample. Furthermore, this comparison also validated the
   applied preconcentration protocol, highlighting its negligible influence
   on organic matter properties when considering copper complexation. (C)

Abstract = {{The activities and structural specificities of extracellular enzymes
   that initiate microbial remineralization of high-molecular-weight (MW)
   organic matter were investigated in surface waters and sediments of an
   Arctic fjord of Svalbard. Hydrolysis rates of a suite of fluorescently
   labeled macromolecular substrates, including seven commercially
   available polysaccharides and three high-carbohydrate-content plankton
   extracts ranged from rapid to not detectable, and differed markedly
   between seawater and sediments. Order (fastest to slowest) of hydrolysis
   in surface water was laminarin, Spirulina extract, xylan>chondroitin,
   alginic acid, Wakame extract>arabinogalactan, fucoidan>Isochrysis
   extract>>>pullulan, while in sediments the order was pullulan,
   laminarin, alginic acid, Wakame extract>chondroitin,
   xylan>arabinogalactan, Isochrysis extract>Spirulina extract>fucoidan.
   These differences cannot be explained by simple scaling factors such as
   differences in microbial cell numbers between seawater and sediments.
   Other investigations have shown that microbial community composition of
   Svalbard sediments and of polar bacterioplankton samples differ
   markedly. These results demonstrate that sedimentary and seawater
   microbial communities also differ fundamentally in their abilities to
   access specific high-MW substrates. Substrate bioavailability depends on
   the capabilities of a microbial community, as well as the chemical and
   structural features of the substrate itself.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter(DOM) is a complex and poorly understood mixture
   of natural polymeric organic material, and plays an important role in
   material transport and carbon balance in aquatic ecosystems. Fluorescent
   dissolved organic matter (FDOM) represents a major portion of the total

   the movement of DOM in aquatic environment. In this work, we have
   applied Excitation/Emission Matrix spectroscopy (EEMs) to study the
   distribution and characteristics of FDOM in seawater of Bohai Sea in
   Northern China. Hierarchical Cluster method has been used to assess the
   similarities and dissimilarities of the entire EEMs data sets of
   seawater samples collected from different regions of the Bohai Sea. The
   distribution of different seawater samples as revealed by multivariate
   results has been used to track the movement of DOM material in the Bay,

Abstract = {{Geochemical estimates of N-2 fixation in the North Atlantic often serve
   as a foundation for estimating global marine diazotrophy. Yet despite
   being well-studied, estimations of nitrogen fixation rates in this basin
   vary widely. Here we investigate the variability in published estimates
   of excess nitrogen accumulation rates in the main thermocline of the
   subtropical North Atlantic, testing the assumptions and choices made in
   the analyses. Employing one of these previously described methods,
   modified here with improved estimates of excess N spatial gradients and
   ventilation rates of the main thermocline, we determine a total excess N
   accumulation rate of 7.8 +/- 1.7 x 10(11) mol N yr (-1). Contributions
   to excess N development include atmospheric deposition of high N:P
   nutrients (adding excess N at a rate of 3.0 +/- 0.9 x 10(11) mol N yr
   (-1) for similar to 3 8\% of the total), high N:P dissolved organic
   matter advected into and mineralized in the main thermocline (adding
   excess N at 2.2 +/- 1.1 x 10 11 mol N yr (-1) for similar to 28\% of the
   total), and, calculated by mass balance of the excess N field, N-2
   fixation (adding excess N at 2.6 +/- 2.2 x 10(11) mol N yr (-1) for
   similar to 33\% of the total). Assuming an N:P of 40 and this rate of
   excess N accumulation due to the process, N-2 fixation in the North
   Atlantic subtropical gyre is estimated at similar to 4 x 10(11) mol N
   yr(-1). This relatively low rate of N-2 fixation suggests that i) the
   rate of N-2 fixation in the North Atlantic is greatly overestimated in
   some previous analyses, ii) the main thermocline is not the primary
   repository of N fixed by diazotrophs, and/or iii) the N:P ratio of
   exported diazotrophic organic matter is much lower than generally
   assumed. It is this last possibility, and our uncertainty in the N:P
   ratios of exported material supporting excess N development, that
   greatly lessens our confidence in geochemical measures of N-2 fixation.

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{265}},
Pages = {{85-96}},
Abstract = {{The effects of macroalgae blooms on seagrasses were assessed by shading
   Zostera noltii Hornem. with Ulva rigida C. Agardh mats under laboratory
   and field conditions. In the laboratory, where there was no direct
   contact between U. rigida and Z. noltii, leaf, rhizome, and root
   elongation rates, as well as gross production, declined as a function of
   U. rigida layers, causing a mobilization of non-structural carbohydrates
   in both above- and belowground tissues to meet carbon demands. However,
   when shading was performed in the field, where direct contact exists
   between Z. noltii and U. rigida, Z. noltii responses were not
   proportional to the number of Ulva layers. Elongation rates and gross
   production were reduced by U. rigida shading, with the lowest values
   under 2 Ulva layers, while there were no significant differences between
   controls and 4 U. rigida layers. This suggests another Ulva effect
   occurs besides shading. To test the likely effect of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) derived from U. rigida, Z. noltii plants were cultured
   under light limitation with radioactive dissolved organic carbon
   ((DOC)-C-14) released by U. rigida. Plants cultured under a full
   (DOC)-C-14 load showed a significant enhancement of growth. The
   (DOC)-C-14 disappeared from the culture medium during the first 4 d of
   culture as a linear function of external (DOC)-C-14 concentration. This
   was coupled to a linear increase of radioactive particulate organic
   carbon ((POC)-C-14) in aboveground tissues, while a substantial part of
   this (POC)-C-14 was allocated in belowground tissues. Overall, the
   (POC)-C-14 incorporated in Z. noltii plants represented ca. 20 to 25\%
   of the (DOC)-C-14 which had disappeared. Therefore, a net transfer of
   (DOC)-C-14 from U. rigida to Z. noltii has been documented. Other
   additional possibilities, such as a light quality effect or other kind
   of signals (i.e. growth factors), are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Diurnal dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence and
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations were followed in the upper 100 m
   of the water column at five stations across the subtropical Atlantic
   Ocean in July and August 1996. The 10\% levels of surface solar
   radiation for the ultraviolet (UV) B range (at 305- and 320-nm
   wavelengths were at 16 and 23 m in depth and for the UVA range (at 340-
   and 380-nm wavelengths) were at 35 and 63 m in depth, respectively. The
   DOM fluorescence decreased over the course of the day, whereas H2O2
   concentrations increased, especially in the diurnally stratified surface
   water layers extending to 10-50-m depth. In situ H2O2 net production
   varied between 5.5 nmol L-1 h(-1) at 5-m depth and 1 nmol L-1 h(-1) at
   40-m depth, resulting in an H2O2 net production of similar to 38 mu mol
   m(-2) d(-1) in the upper 50 m of the water column. Photochemical oxygen
   (O-2) demand of water collected at 10-m depth in the early morning and
   exposed to surface solar radiation varied between 0.9 and 2.8 mu mol O-2
   L-1 d(-1) and was found to be consistently higher (by a 1.3-8.3-fold
   measure) than bacterial respiration (measured in 0.8 mum-filtered
   seawater in the dark). WE radiation was responsible for 0-30\% of the
   photochemical O-2 demand. A simple one-dimensional physical model was
   combined with a photochemical/ biological model in order to describe the
   photochemical production of H2O2 at different depth layers over the
   course of the day and to determine the contribution of physical versus
   biological processes in terms of the loss of H2O2 from the surface
   lavers in the late afternoon. The model reflects well the observed
   diurnal H2O2 dynamics. It further provides evidence that mainly
   biological breakdown determines the loss of H2O2 in the upper 50 m of
   the water column during the day; however, in the late afternoon,
   vertical mixing is important in transporting H2O2 from the uppermost 5-m
   layer to the 10-20-m layers.}},

   autumn, on which the study focusses, the metals Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni
   and Zn are extensively leached from these acidic soils (pH = 2.5-4.5),
   while As, Cr, Fe and V are not leached more strongly from this soil type
   than from areas of till and peat. A speciation experiment, based on
   anion and cation exchange of the stream waters in the field, showed that
   (1) the metals Al, Cd, Co, Mn, Ni and Zn are transported in the streams
   mainly as inorganic cations, (2) Cu exists mainly in cationic form but
   is also to a significant extent associated with dissolved humic
   substances, (3) Fe occurs mainly in the anionic fraction explained by
   organic coating on colloidal Fe oxyhydoxides and (4) the hydrochemistry
   of As, Cr and V is complex as these elements may exist in several
   unquantified anionic fractions and to a minor extent in cationic

   elements in the stream waters, these soils did not have a large affect

Abstract = {{The influence of sunlight on bacterioplankton production was
   investigated over a 12-month period in Laguna Madre, a shallow,
   subtropical, seagrass-dominated lagoon in south Texas. Two types of
   experiments were conducted every 6 to 8 weeks from June 1996 through
   June 1997 to assess the effect of photochemical transformations of
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) on bacterial production and the net
   effect of sunlight exposure on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton
   production in surface waters. Photobleaching of DOM was observed;
   however, estimates of the photomineralization of DOM in May and July
   were very low and indicated that this process could represent at most
   3\% of water column respiration. Photochemical transformations of DOM
   did not have any significant effect on bacterioplankton activity.
   However, bacterial production measured during exposure of water samples
   to natural sunlight in the summer months, with and without ultraviolet
   light, was enhanced relative to dark controls. Phytoplankton release of
   bioavailable substrates appeared to be responsible for light-mediated
   increases in bacterioplankton production. Bacterio- and phytoplankton
   were not photoinhibited by exposure to ultraviolet radiation in surface
   waters. Overall, we observed no indication of photoinhibition of
   microbial processes in Laguna Madre, and photochemical transformations
   appeared to play a minor role in the cycling of DOM. The low
   photoreactivity of DOM in combination with its relatively high
   bioreactivity appeared responsible for the minor role of photochemical
   transformations in the cycling of DOM in Laguna Madre.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the production and N2
   fixation responses of a hypersaline mat community following a reduction
   in salinity and nutrient enrichment. Cyanobacteria-dominated microbial
   mat samples were collected from hypersaline Storr's Lake and normal
   seawater salinity Pigeon Creek and preincubated at ambient (90 parts per
   thousands) and reduced (45 parts-per-thousand) salinities following no
   nutrient as well as inorganic nutrient (NO3-, PO4-, trace metals) and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC, as mannitol) enrichment. CO2 and N2
   fixation rates were determined 2 and 4 days later. In addition, DOC
   (trace concentrations of H-3-labeled glucose and amino acids) uptake was
   measured in mats under normal and hypersaline conditions. A reduction in
   salinity from 90 to 45 parts per thousand significantly enhanced CO2 and
   N2 fixation rates, but inorganic nutrient and DOC additions did not
   significantly enhanced rates compared with the controls. Dissolved
   organic carbon/dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) uptake was not
   influenced over the entire range of salinities (45-90 parts per
   thousand) used in this study. When salinity-induced osmotic stress was
   relieved, mats underwent enhanced primary production and nitrogen
   fixation. Abiotic stress, induced by hypersaline conditions in Bahamian
   lagoons, results in lower productivity of the microbial mat communities
   and this stress may outweigh the typical limiting factors regulating
   phototrophic community primary production.}},

Abstract = {{The applicability of a recently presented method (Stepwise
   Thermogravimetry, STG) to characterize biogenic organic matter
   (Kristensen 1990) was tested in comparative decomposition experiments.
   The initial microbial decay of pre-dried, fresh detritus from 6
   different plant materials (2 macroalgae, 2 seagrasses, and 2 tree
   leaves) was examined for 70 days in aerobic seawater slurries. In
   addition, slurries of sediment detritus of low reactivity, representing
   the late stage of plant decay, were allowed to decompose aerobically and
   anaerobically for 200 days. Macroalgae lost 40-44\% carbon over 70 days,
   whereas seagrasses lost 29-33\% and tree leaves lost 0-8\%. After a 3-5
   days leaching phase, the temporal pattern of POC and PON loss from the
   plant detritus was exponential with higher rates for the former
   resulting in a 5-28\% reduced C:N ratio. The Rp index decreased <20\%)
   during the initial leaching phase followed by a 30-40\% increase to the
   end. Initial Rp was directly proportional to decay rate. POC loss in the
   anaerobic sediment slurry was 10\% over the 200 day period (the aerobic
   was hampered by low pH). Preferential loss of PON caused a 30\% increase
   in C:N ratio. The Rp index of sediment detritus also increased with
   30\%. Although the present laboratory experiments not fully simulate the
   natural environment, the Rp-C:N relationship obtained from the two
   slurry experiments can illustrate the general pattern of plant decay
   from fresh to refractory (humic) detritus. During initial aerobic decay,
   rapid leaching and microbial growth causes a decrease in both Rp and C:N
   ('Rapid growth', phase 1). When all labile substrates have been consumed
   and the slower decay is controlled by enzymatic attack on particles with
   an associated production of humic compounds and accumulation of nitrogen
   rich bacterial cell remains, Rp increases and C:N decreases ('Slow
   growth', phase 2). Later, when condensed humic compounds have
   accumulated, decay ceases. Most carbon is now bound in forms which are
   of low availability to bacteria and a preferential mineralization of
   nitrogen occurs; both Rp and C:N increases ('Condenzation', phase 3).}},

Abstract = {{Consumption of sulfate (SO42-) in the sulfate-methane transition zone
   (SMTZ) has often been considered to be due solely to anaerobic oxidation
   of methane (AOM). However, recent studies show SO42- fluxes into the
   SMTZ that exceed methane (CH4) fluxes, thereby challenging this
   conceptual model. Co-occurrence of organoclastic SO42- reduction (oSR)
   with AOM in the SMTZ has been hypothesized to be the cause for this flux
   imbalance, but conclusive evidence is lacking. To address this knowledge
   gap, we investigated organic matter cycling in the SMTZ of the
   organic-rich sediments of the Santa Barbara Basin, California
   Borderland, and examined the occurrence of oSR within this zone using
   bulk solute profiles and Delta C-14 and delta C-13 values of selected
   carbon pools. We also tested the hypothesis that the SMTZ acts as an
   oxidation front not just for CH4, but also for dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) that is produced below the SMTZ and migrates upward. Mass balance
   calculations for the SMTZ based on reaction stoichiometry and Delta C-14
   and delta C-13 values of associated carbon fluxes indicate that similar
   to 35-45\% of total SO42- reduction in the SMTZ occurs via oSR, with the
   remainder attributable to AOM. The delta C-13 value of net DOC
   production is distinct from that of the fraction of bulk POC undergoing
   degradation, suggesting that porewater DOC represents a compositionally
   unique slice of the metabolizable POC pool. DOC diffusing upward at 450
   cm is virtually free of C-14 and contain low levels of short-chain
   organic acids. Radiocarbon mass balance shows that >30\% of this
   pre-aged, and presumably refractory, DOC is removed from the pore waters
   within or immediately below the SMTZ. Although the SMTZ does not appear
   to be a major net DOC oxidation front, these results show that DOC
   dynamics provide unique insights into organic matter processing in these
   subsurface sediments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The uptake of anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 by the oceans causes a shift
   in the carbonate chemistry system which includes a lowering of pH; this
   process has been termed ocean acidification. Our understanding of the
   specific effects of ocean acidification on chemical speciation of trace
   metals, in particular on organic-metal interactions, is limited. In this
   study we have experimentally determined the effects of changing pH from
   83 to 6.8 (on the NBS scale) on the speciation of iron and copper in
   estuarine waters. Our experimental results indicated that complexation
   of iron and copper would decrease and inorganic iron and copper
   concentrations increase, as pH decreased, although it was not possible
   to confidently quantify changes in speciation at lower pH due to
   constraints of the analytical technique. In addition to our experimental
   approach, we used a non-ideal competitive adsorption (NICA)-Donnan model
   to determine the chemical speciation of iron and copper as a function of
   pH. The NICA-Donnan model was optimised in order to produce similar
   metal binding characteristics to those observed in our sample across the
   pH range examined in our study. The model allowed for simultaneous
   modelling of solubility and organic complexation. Model results
   indicated that a decrease in iron and copper binding by organic matter
   at lower pH, coupled with increased solubility (for iron), resulted in a
   3 fold increase in inorganic iron concentration and a 6 fold increase in
   inorganic copper concentration at pH of 7.41 compared to a pH of 8.18
   (expressed on the total scale). This compared to a 10 fold increase in
   inorganic iron concentration, and a 5 fold increase in inorganic copper
   concentration, obtained at pH 8.18, when the dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) concentration was halved. Variability in DOC might thus be
   expected to have a greater impact on metal speciation in seawater, than
   projected variability in pH resulting from increases in atmospheric CO2.
   Our study therefore suggests that increases in the concentrations of the
   more bioavailable inorganic iron and copper species in estuarine waters
   resulting from increased pCO(2) are likely to occur, but that such
   changes will be moderate in magnitude. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Photoautotrophic plankton in the surface ocean release organic compounds
   that fuel secondary production by heterotrophic bacteria. Here we show
   that an abundant marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus,
   contributes a variety of nitrogen-rich and sulfur-containing compounds
   to dissolved organic matter. A combination of targeted and untargeted
   metabolomics and genomic tools was used to characterize the
   intracellular and extracellular metabolites of S.elongatus. Aromatic
   compounds, such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and phenylalanine, as well as
   nucleosides (e.g. thymidine, 5-methylthioadenosine, xanthosine), the
   organosulfur compound 3-mercaptopropionate, and the plant auxin indole
   3-acetic acid, were released by S.elongatus at multiple time points
   during its growth. Further, the amino acid kynurenine was found to
   accumulate in the media even though it was not present in the predicted
   metabolome of S.elongatus. This indicates that some metabolites,
   including those not predicted by an organism's genome, are likely
   excreted into the environment as waste; however, these molecules may
   have broader ecological relevance if they are labile to nearby microbes.
   The compounds described herein provide excellent targets for
   quantitative analysis in field settings to assess the source and
   lability of dissolved organic matter in situ.}},

Title = {{Influence of tides and waves on the fate of nutrients in a nearshore
   aquifer: Numerical simulations}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{203-213}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A numerical investigation is presented that demonstrates the influence
   of tides and waves on the transport and transformation of nutrients
   (NO3-; NH4+; PO43-) in a homogeneous unconfined nearshore aquifer and
   subsequent fluxes to the sea. Simulations of an aquifer subject to
   semi-diurnal tides and constant waves acting on a sloping beach face
   were conducted using SEAWAT-2005 combined with PHT3D v2.10. Tidal
   amplitude (A) and wave height (H-rms) varying from 0.25 to 0.75 m and 1
   to 2 m, respectively, were examined. Results show that tides and waves
   modify the subsurface discharge pathway of land-derived nutrients by
   changing the nearshore groundwater flow dynamics. More importantly, the
   oceanic forcing impacts nutrient cycling as it causes significant
   seawater exchange (along with dissolved O-2 and organic matter) across
   the aquifer-ocean interface. Although steady wave forcing caused higher
   seawater influx, tides led to greater seawater-freshwater mixing in the
   nearshore aquifer and subsequently greater transformation of
   land-derived nutrients. Nutrient processing was strongly controlled by
   the availability and reactivity of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   as its degradation consumed O-2, released inorganic N and P, and altered
   redox conditions in the salt-freshwater mixing zones. For the conditions
   and reaction network simulated, nutrient regeneration by marine DOM
   degradation was independent of the seawater-freshwater mixing intensity,
   and therefore was greatest for the wave case due to the high seawater
   influx. For simulations without marine DOM considered, NO3- discharge to
   the sea increased by 32\% for the tidal case (A = 0.5 m) compared to
   only 13\% and 8\% for the wave (H-rms = 1 m) and no oceanic forcing
   cases. With labile marine DOM considered, the NO3- discharge decreased
   by 90\% relative to the land-derived flux for the tidal case (A = 0.5
   m). For all simulations PO43- removal was high due to its adsorption to
   Fe oxide minerals. The model enables evaluation of the complex coupled
   physical-biogeochemical processes controlling nutrient loading to the
   sea via submarine groundwater discharge in dynamic coastal environments.

Abstract = {{Cycling of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was investigated in anoxic
   sediments of the Santa Monica Basin, California Borderland, by analyzing
   the concentration and isotopic signatures (Delta C-14 and delta C-13) of
   pore-water DOC and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and organic
   compound classes extracted from the bulk sediments. DOC and DIC
   increased across the sediment-water interface, indicating net efflux of
   these solutes out of the sediments. Throughout the depth interval
   examined (0-30 cm), the Delta C-14 value of DOC (Delta C-14(DOC)) was
   similar to, or higher than, that of bulk sedimentary particulate organic
   carbon (POC), indicating degradation of relatively C-14-rich components
   of POC. There were prominent peaks in both Delta C-14(DOC) and Delta(14)
   C-DIC in the uppermost 2 cm of the sediment column, indicating
   degradation and remineralization of C-14-rich, labile organic matter in
   the near-surface sediments. However, below these sub-surface maxima,
   Delta C-14(DOC) and Delta(14) C-DIC decreased with depth by similar to
   200 parts per thousand and similar to 50 parts per thousand,
   respectively. Given the diffusive time scales, these decreases were too
   large to be explained by C-14 loss due to radioactive decay. To help
   explain these observations, we constructed and implemented a selective
   degradation model that considers bulk pore-water DOC to be the sum of
   three kinetically- and isotopically-distinct sub-components. Based on
   this model, the most reactive DOC fraction, which supported similar to
   60\% of the DIC production, had a Delta C-14 value indicating the
   presence of bomb-C-14. The intermediate fraction had a Delta C-14 value
   of similar to-\&60\% and accounted for most of the pore-water DOC
   standing stock. The least reactive fraction was virtually non-reactive
   in these sediments, and had a Delta C-14 value of similar to-500 parts
   per thousand. The benthic DOC flux of this C-14-depleted,
   poorly-reactive DOC fraction may represent a source of pre-aged,
   refractory DOC to the oceans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   bacterial reworking}},
Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Compound-specific delta N-15 analysis of individual amino acids (delta
   N-15-AA) represents a potentially important new tool which may reveal
   the molecular-level basis for ON signature of dissolved organic nitrogen
   (DON) in the ocean, as well indicate DON sources and specific mechanisms
   of alteration. Past work has indicated that delta N-15-AA may be
   effective at indicating the effects of microbial heterotrophy, however
   the influence of bacterial degradation on delta N-15-AA patterns has
   never been directly investigated. Here we measured molecular-level
   changes in delta N-15-AA patterns in freshly produced algal high
   molecular weight (HMW) DON due to heterotrophic bacterial reworking,
   together with linked changes in enantiomeric (D vs. L) AA ratios and
   also the AA molar percentage-based degradation index (DI). Our results
   show a strong increase in degradation with microbial consumption of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), consistent with previous studies. The
   delta N-15-AA data show systematically higher delta N-15 values for most
   individual AA after DOC bacterial reworking, resulting in average
   increases of 3-6 parts per thousand in delta N-15 of total proteinaceous
   material. The average deviation in the delta N-15 values of all AA
   (Sigma V parameter) also increased with degradation, indicating an
   increase in delta N-15-AA pattern complexity, most likely due to
   selected microbial resynthesis of specific AA. These results show that
   delta N-15-AA patterns have the ability to directly track the effects of
   microbial resynthesis in DON. They indicate that delta N-15-AA
   represents a highly specific tracer that provides independent, and yet
   strongly complimentary, information vs. existing AA-based degradation
   indicators. Together, our data suggests that heterotrophic microbial
   degradation in the ocean would be expected to increase delta N-15 values
   of the oceanic DON pool vs. autotrophic sources. This conclusion is
   consistent with recent results on delta N-15 signatures of total and
   HMWDON pool in the open sea, however it also strongly implicates
   bacterial sources as the likely mechanism for delta N-15-DON changes.
   Reevaluating existing DON isotopic data in light of these results may
   improve our understanding of the influence and mechanism of bacterial
   reworking on DON long-term preservation in the marine water column. (C)

Abstract = {{In the tidal inlet of the back barrier area of Spiekeroog Island
   (Southern North Sea), nutrient concentrations (silica, phosphate, and
   nitrite plus nitrate) were determined hourly by an autonomously
   analysing system on a permanently installed time-series station from
   April 2006 to December 2008. Based on the high frequency of analyses we
   studied nutrient dynamics on annual, seasonal, and tidal time scales. By
   comparing the nutrient input to the tidal flat area via freshwater
   through a flood-gate and pore water discharge from tidal flat sediments,
   we conclude that nutrients are primarily supplied to the water column by
   pore water advection, while the freshwater contribution is negligible.
   To assess the annual nutrient contribution of our study area to the
   German Bight, we used a numerical Euler-Lagrangian model (EcoTiM) to
   calculate annual budgets of silica, phosphate, and nitrite plus nitrate.
   The model results indicate that the back barrier area of Spiekeroog
   Island exports inorganic silica (128{*}10(6) mol a(-1)), phosphate
   (3{*}10(6) mol a(-1)), and nitrite plus nitrate (29{*}10(6) mol a(-1))
   to the North Sea. Extrapolation of these data to the entire Wadden Sea
   along the Southern North Sea reveals that the back barrier areas export
   silica and phosphate in the same order of magnitude and nitrite plus
   nitrate one order of magnitude lower than the combined rivers Elbe.

Abstract = {{Bacterioplankton plays a central role in energy and matter fluxes in the
   sea, yet the factors that constrain its variation in marine systems are
   still poorly understood. Here we use the explanatory power of direct
   multivariate gradient analysis to evaluate the driving forces exerted by
   environmental parameters on bacterial community distribution in the
   water column. We gathered and analysed data from a one month sampling
   period from the surface to 1000m depth at the JGOFS-DYFAMED station (NW
   Mediterranean Sea). This station is characterized by very poor
   horizontal advection currents which makes it an ideal model to test
   hypotheses on the causes of vertical stratification of bacterial
   communities. Capillary electrophoresis single strand conformation
   polymorphism (CE-SSCP) fingerprinting profiles analyzed using
   multivariate statistical methods demonstrated a vertical zonation of
   bacterial assemblages in three layers, above, in or just below the
   chlorophyll maximum and deeper, that remained stable during the entire
   sampling period. Through the use of direct gradient multivariate
   ordination analyses we demonstrate that a complex array of
   bio-geochemical parameters is the driving force behind bacterial
   community structure shifts in the water column. Physico-chemical
   parameters such as phosphate, nitrate, salinity and to a lesser extent
   temperature, oxygen, dissolved organic carbon and photosynthetically
   active radiation acted in synergy to explain bacterial assemblages
   changes with depth. Analysis of lipid biomarkers of organic matter
   sources and fates suggested that bacterial community structure in the
   surface layers was in part explained by lipids of chloroplast origin.
   Further detailed analysis of pigment-based phytoplankton diversity gave
   evidence of a compartmentalized influence of several phytoplankton
   groups on bacterial community structure in the first 150m depth.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM), as humic acids (HA), in
   natural waters is assumed to decrease dissolved metal biclavailability

   concentration in solution. In this study, Pb complexation by HA in
   artificial seawater was checked by means of square wave anodic stripping
   voltarnmetry (SWASV). Uptake and toxicity of this metal in the absence
   and presence of HA was tested using excised gills of Mytilus edulis and
   the Paracentrotus lividus embryo-larval bioassay respectively. Both Pb
   uptake by mussel gills and Pb toxicity to sea urchin larvae increased in
   the presence of HA, and this increase was higher at higher HA
   concentrations. Since it is shown that the presence of DOM can enhance
   the uptake and toxicity of lead in some important marine invertebrate
   species, these results challenge the general applicability of the free
   ion activity and related models used for deriving environmental water

Abstract = {{Photochemical behaviour of sulcotrione, a triketone herbicide, was
   studied in a variety of aqueous solutions including natural waters (sea
   and river) under laboratory conditions. Photodegradation experiments
   were carried out under two irradiation systems (UV-B and simulated solar
   radiation) in order to evaluate kinetics of active ingredient. The
   degradation kinetics, more rapid under UV-B radiation than solar
   simulator, followed a first-order reaction (photolysis half-lives ranged
   between 3 and 50h) and appeared strongly dependent on water origin, pH
   value and molecular structure of the herbicide. Dissolved organic matter
   showed a retarding effect while low concentrations of nitrate ions had
   no effect on photolysis rate. Identification of photoproducts indicated
   that hydrolysis, a pH-dependent process (no degradation at pH > 6 but at
   pH = 3, k = 0.0344 h(-1)), could be photoassisted. These results were
   compared to those of mesotrione, another triketone herbicide, which
   appeared more stable under UV-B irradiation.

Abstract = {{The spatiotemporal chemical characteristics of the water column in
   Linsley Pond, a freshwater lake in Connecticut, were studied from just
   before its stratification in April through the fall turnover in
   December. Two low-molecular-weight thiols, glutathione and
   3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), were detected at nanomolar
   concentrations in the water column. GSH was detected (average
   concentrations were ca. 5 nmol L-1 in the particulate phase and ca. 3
   nmol L-1 in the dissolved phase) in surface and near-surface waters only
   and covaried with chlorophyll a. Both particulate and dissolved MPA were
   measured in the oxic and anoxic regions. In the metalimnion, MPA
   concentrations were greater than in the oxic water layers above. At
   times, the MPA concentrations in the metalimnion were as high as those
   found in the anoxic hypolimnion. The MPA present at different depths in
   the Linsley Pond water column is most likely produced through dissimilar
   mechanisms. Throughout the water column, MPA may be a product of the
   metabolic degradation of sulfur-containing organic compounds; however,
   in the hypolimnetic waters, dissolved sulfide may play an important role
   in MPA formation through abiotic nucleophillic addition to unsaturated
   functionalities in dissolved organic matter. Parallel laboratory
   experiments were performed to assess the importance of MPA in copper
   speciation. The results confirmed that despite nanomolar levels in
   Linsley Pond, MPA does not play an important role in copper speciation.
   A survey of six additional lakes in Connecticut was made for detectable
   thiols. Only MPA was detected in four of these lakes, and its
   distribution was similar to that in Linsley Pond.}},

Abstract = {{Seawater samples were collected from stations along a transect across
   the shelf basin interface in the western Arctic Ocean during September
   2002, and analyzed for nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and
   total dissolved carbohydrate (TDCHO) constituents, including
   monosaccharides (MCHO) and polysaccharides (PCHO). Nutrients (nitrate,
   ammonium, phosphate and dissolved silica) were depleted at the surface,
   especially nitrate. Their concentrations increased with increasing
   depth, with maxima centered at similar to 125 m depth within the
   halocline layer, then decreased with increasing depth below the maxima.
   Both ammonium and phosphate concentrations were elevated in shelf bottom
   waters, indicating a possible nutrient source from sediments, and in a
   plume that extended into the upper halocline waters offshore.
   Concentrations of DOC ranged from 45 to 85 mu M and had an inverse
   correlation with salinity, indicating that mixing is a control on DOC
   concentrations. Concentrations of TDCHO ranged from 2.5 to 19 mu M-C,
   comprising 13-20\% of the bulk DOC. Higher DOC concentrations were found
   in the upper water column over the shelf along with higher TDCHO
   concentrations. Within the TDCHO pool, the concentrations of MCHO ranged
   from 0.4 to 8.6 mu M-C, comprising 20-50\% of TDCHO, while PCHO
   concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 13.6 mu M-C, comprising 50-80\% of the
   TDCHO. The MCHO/TDCHO ratio was low in the upper 25 in of the water
   column, followed by a high MCHO/TDCHO ratio between 25 and 100 m, and a
   low MCHO/TDCHO ratio again below 100 m. The high MCHO/TDCHO ratio within
   the halocline layer likely resulted from particle decomposition and
   associated release of MCHO, whereas the low MCHO/TDCHO (or high
   PCHO/TDCHO) ratio below the halocline layer could have resulted from
   slow decomposition and additional particulate CHO sources. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{A mass budget study of major in-lake Al fluxes, palae-olimnological data
   on a > 10 000 year old sediment record, and in situ photochemical
   experiments performed at Plesne Lake (Czech Republic) suggest that
   photochemical liberation of organically bound aluminum (Al) and iron
   (Fe) by solar radiation is a significant natural source of their ionic
   species for lakes and subsequent oxyhydroxides for sediments. The
   results show that photochemically induced transformation of dissolved Al
   and Fe to solid oxyhydroxides deposited to Plesne Lake sediment
   dominated (91 and 73\%, respectively) their sedimentary flux throughout
   the preindustrial era, since soil formation initiated in the catchment.
   The following sequence of processes occurs: (i) soil organic acids
   dissolve and bind metals and export them from terrestrial to aquatic
   systems. (ii) Photochemical decomposition of organic-metal complexes
   liberates a significant portion (similar to 50\% in Plesne Lake) of
   organically bound Al and Fe as inorganic ions. (iii) The liberated ionic
   Al and Fe hydrolyze, precipitate as oxyhydroxide particles, and settle.
   We hypothesise that the same Al and Fe transporting process occurs in
   other lakes and coastal marine areas and is ecologically important
   because Al and Fe oxyhydroxides can bind trace metals and phosphorus.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial production is an integral recycling mechanism that facilitates
   carbon flow through aquatic food webs. Factors influencing bacterial
   activity therefore impact carbon flow. Although ecologists consider
   grazing and dissolved organic carbon flux to be the major regulators of
   bacterial activity, we explored two other important pressures.
   Virus-like particle abundance ranged from 3.7 + 10(10) to 37.9 +
   10(10).L-1 in samples collected during August 1997 and July 1998.
   Bacterial abundance during these periods ranged from 1.8 + 10(9) to 4.6
   + 10(9).L-1. Based on electron microscopic analysis, viruses in Lake
   Erie would have been responsible for 12.1-23.4\% of bacterial mortality
   and, in quasi-steady-state conditions, a comparable loss of bacterial
   productivity. In the central basin, solar radiation was also
   demonstrated to regulate bacterial productivity. Ultraviolet radiation
   (295-400 nm) was shown to inhibit bacterial productivity according to a
   cumulative exposure kinetic model, and biological weighting functions
   were derived to enable calculation of time- and depth-integrated
   photoinhibition. The daytime photoinhibitory loss of bacterial carbon
   production was estimated to be 14-30\% over the upper 5 m, primarily due
   to ultraviolet radiation > 320 nm. Viruses and sunlight are therefore of
   comparable importance as regulators of bacterial activity in this
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Live Skeletonema costatum (diatom) cells labeled with C-14 Were added to
   the sediment surface in 10 cores containing intertidal sediment from
   Saanich Inlet, Vancouver Island, Canada. The water overlying the
   sediment in 5 cores was sparged with atmospheric air, whereas the other
   5 cores were sparged with N-2. Release of (CO2)-C-14 Started immediately
   in the oxic cores, reaching a maximum at Days 3 to 4, whereas release in
   the anoxic cores was slower with a maximum after 6 to 9 d. (DOC)-C-14
   (dissolved organic carbon) release also exhibited high rates initially,
   but with the highest release in the anoxic cores. Degradation to
   (CO2)-C-14 and (DOC)-C-14 could be described by 2 successive exponential
   decays representing 2 decomposable fractions. After 80 d, 58 and 42\% of
   the added label had been released as (CO2)-C-14, and 2 and 13\% were
   released as (DOC)-C-14 in the oxic and anoxic cores, respectively. The
   porewater contained only small amounts of (CO2)-C-14 and (DOC)-C-14.
   However, oxic cores showed the lowest concentrations, indicating
   faunally enhanced solute fluxes in these cores. Between 31 and 37\% of
   the added label remained as (POC)-C-14 (particulate organic carbon) in
   the sediment after 80 d. Similar amounts of dissolved carbon
   ((CO2)-C-14+(DOC)-C-14) were lost from the added algal POC under oxic
   and anoxic conditions, but the larger amounts of (DOC)-C-14 released
   from the sediment in the anoxic cores indicated a slower anaerobic
   mineralization of (DOC)-C-14.}},

Abstract = {{Marine picocyanobacteria of the genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus
   are the most numerous photosynthetic organisms on our planet {[}1, 2].
   With a global population size of 3.6 x 10(27) {[}3], they are
   responsible for approximately 10\% of global primary production {[}3,
   4]. Viruses that infect Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus (cyanophages)
   can be readily isolated from ocean waters {[}5-7] and frequently
   outnumber their cyanobacterial hosts {[}8]. Ultimately,
   cyanophage-induced lysis of infected cells results in the release of
   fixed carbon into the dissolved organic matter pool {[}9]. What is less
   well known is the functioning of photosynthesis during the relatively
   long latent periods of many cyanophages {[}10, 11]. Remarkably, the
   genomes of many cyanophage isolates contain genes involved in
   photosynthetic electron transport (PET) {[}12-18] as well as central
   carbon metabolism {[}14, 15, 19, 20], suggesting that cyanophages may
   play an active role in photosynthesis. However, cyanophage-encoded gene
   products are hypothesized to maintain or even supplement PET for energy
   generation while sacrificing wasteful CO2 fixation during infection
   {[}17,18, 20]. Yet this paradigm has not been rigorously tested. Here,
   we measured the ability of viral-infected Synechococcus cells to fix CO2
   as well as maintain PET. We compared two cyanophage isolates that share
   different complements of PET and central carbon metabolism genes. We
   demonstrate cyanophage-dependent inhibition of CO2 fixation early in the
   infection cycle. In contrast, PET is maintained throughout infection.
   Our data suggest a generalized strategy among marine cyanophages to
   redirect photosynthesis to support phage development, which has
   important implications for estimates of global primary production.}},

Abstract = {{Sea spray aerosol (SSA) particles represent one of the most abundant
   surfaces available for heterogeneous reactions to occur upon and thus
   profoundly alter the composition of the troposphere. In an effort to
   better understand tropospheric heterogeneous reaction processes,
   fundamental laboratory studies must be able to accurately reproduce the
   chemical complexity of SSA. Here we describe a new approach that uses
   microbial processes to control the composition of seawater and SSA
   particle composition. By inducing a phytoplankton bloom, we are able to
   create dynamic ecosystem interactions between marine microorganisms,
   which serve to alter the organic mixtures present in seawater. Using
   this controlled approach, changes in seawater composition become
   reflected in the chemical composition of SSA particles 4 to 10 d after
   the peak in chlorophyll-a. This approach for producing and varying the
   chemical complexity of a dominant tropospheric aerosol provides the
   foundation for further investigations of the physical and chemical
   properties of realistic SSA particles under controlled conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and bacterioplankton
   were examined during a diatom and Phaeocystis bloom in the Santa Barbara
   Channel (SBC) over five days following an upwelling event. The SBC was
   heterogeneous in physical state (recently upwelled vs. more stratified),
   nutrient concentration, and productivity, encompassing phytoplankton
   physiological states from a healthy bloom through the onset of silicon
   stress. DOC accumulated in the upper 10 m over the bloom, with
   compositional shifts indicated by chromophoric dissolved organic matter
   (CDOM) parameters. DOC bioavailability and bacterial growth and
   community composition responses were assessed with dilution
   batch-culture bioassays. In these experiments, bacterioplankton DOC
   usage increased over the bloom, with uptake of 1.5-5.3 mu mol L-1 over
   three days, 1.5-5.7 mu mol L-1 over one week, and 1.8-10.8 mu mol L-1
   over 10 weeks. DOC removal was poorly correlated with traditional
   proxies of bioavailability (chlorophyll a concentration, elemental
   ratios of dissolved organic matter, and CDOM). However, bacterial growth
   efficiency (BGE) was strongly related to in situ conditions, with higher
   BGEs on fresher, late-bloom DOC. After 10 weeks, 1.6-15.7 mu mol L-1 of
   the DOC that accumulated during the bloom remained unutilized in the
   bioassays, with higher concentrations of persistent DOC in experiments
   from senescent bloom physiological states, supporting the putative
   relationship between phytoplankton blooms and seasonal DOC accumulation
   in the field. These experiments demonstrate that DOC released by the
   plankton community during a bloom fuels increased short-term and
   long-term bacterial activity, enhances presumed trophic transfer via
   increased BGEs, and leads to the accumulation of persistent, potentially
   exportable, DOC. (C) 2015 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and

Title = {{Nanoscale lignin particles as sources of dissolved iron to the ocean}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{Primary production in large areas of the open ocean is limited by low
   iron concentrations. Rivers are potential sources of iron to the ocean,
   however, riverine iron is prone to intense flocculation and
   sedimentation in the estuarine mixing zone. Here we report the detection
   of iron-rich nanoparticles in a typical peatland-draining creek which
   are resistant against salt-induced flocculation i.e., their behavior is
   in sharp contrast to the well-known behavior of Fe colloids in river
   waters. Sample fractionation by AsFlFFF (Asymmetric Flow Field Flow
   Fractionation) revealed that these powerful iron carriers are in the
   size range of only 0.5-3.0 nm hydrodynamic diameter. They were isolated
   from the water phase using solid phase extraction/gel permeation
   chromatography, and analyzed by a CuO oxidation/GC-MS method. Our
   results suggest that the particles consist mainly of lignin catabolites
   and that gymnosperm as well as angiosperm tissues are contributors to
   the seawater-resistant iron-bearing DOM. Lignin phenols, which have no
   autochthonous source in the ocean, have been nevertheless found in low
   concentrations throughout the entire Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific
   oceans. It is therefore tempting to speculate that peatland-derived
   iron-bearing lignin particles may have a sufficiently long half-life in
   ocean waters to sustain iron concentration in extended regions of the
   ocean.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) significantly decreased accumulation of
   methylmercury (MeHg) by the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana in laboratory
   experiments. Live diatom cells accumulated two to four times more MeHg
   than dead cells, indicating that accumulation may be partially an
   energy-requiring process. Methylmercury enrichment in diatoms relative
   to ambient water was measured by a volume concentration factor (VCF).
   Without added DOM, the maximum VCF was 32?x?104, and the average VCF
   (from 10 to 72 h) over all experiments was 12.6?x?104. At very low (1.5
   mg/L) added DOM, VCFs dropped by approximately half. At very high (20
   mg/L) added DOM, VCFs dropped 10-fold. Presumably, MeHg was bound to a
   variety of reduced sulfur sites on the DOM, making it unavailable for
   uptake. Diatoms accumulated significantly more MeHg when exposed to
   transphilic DOM extracts than hydrophobic ones. However, algal lysate, a
   labile type of DOM created by resuspending a marine diatom in
   freshwater, behaved similarly to a refractory DOM isolate from San
   Francisco Bay. Addition of 67?mu M L-cysteine resulted in the largest
   drop in VCFs, to 0.28?x?104. Although the DOM composition influenced the
   availability of MeHg to some extent, total DOM concentration was the
   most important factor in determining algal bioaccumulation of MeHg.

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is degraded
   when filtered through permeable shelf sediments. In a laboratory flume
   experiment the concave shape of DOC profiles observed in the upper 10 cm
   of Gulf of Mexico sublittoral sands was reproduced by the combination of
   DOC filtration and production in the sediment surface layer and
   mineralization and adsorption in the subsurface layer. Six percent to
   14\% of C-13-labeled, highly degradable DOC was mineralized during
   filtration through 5.8-cm-long sand-filled column reactors, up to nine
   times more than in dark, water-filled column reactors. Filtration
   through 50-cm-long sand columns removed all highly degradable DOC pumped
   through the sediment, translating to fluxes of up to 379 mmol DOC m(-2)
   d(-1), corresponding to DOC removal from an approximately 1-m-deep water
   layer each day. Bacterial incorporation of C-13 identified a diverse
   group of sedimentary aerobic and anaerobic microbes processing
   (DOC)-C-13 filtered through sand columns, dominated by
   Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and
   Planctomycetes. Excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy analysis of
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter contained in diatom-derived DOC
   indicated that microbes preferentially removed components around the
   fluorescence peak of tryptophan or protein-like substances, which may
   have the highest nutrient value. Mass spectra analysis revealed that
   filtration through sand also removes a broad spectrum of substances from
   less degradable humic and fulvic acid-like DOC and produces new DOC
   components. The flushed sand layer between the water column and deeper
   anoxic sediment layers acts as an effective DOC filter, with subsurface
   horizontal pore-water flows promoting decomposition of DOC.}},

Abstract = {{The quantity of chromophoric or coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
   released by eleven species of intertidal and sub-tidal macroalgae
   commonly found on UK shores was investigated. The subsequent breakdown
   of CDOM was also measured by exposing collected CDOM samples to light
   and dark conditions for over two weeks. CDOM absorption properties were
   compared at a fixed wavelength of 440 nm and across two integrated wave
   - bands; UV-A (400-315 nm) and UV-B (315-280 nm). Absorption spectra of
   macroalgal CDOM samples were typically characterized by peaks and
   shoulders in the UV bands, features which were species specific. The
   spectral slope, derived using the log-linear method, proved to be very
   specific to the species and to the effect of light. Slope measurements
   ranged from 0.010 to 0.027 nm(-1), in the range of normal seawater
   values. Significantly more CDOM was produced by algae which were
   illuminated, providing evidence for alight driven exudation mechanism.
   Averaged across all species, exudation in the dark accounted for 63.7\%
   of that in the light in the UV-B band. Interspecific differences in
   exudation rate encompassed an order of magnitude, with the highest
   absorption measurements attributable to brown algae. However, some brown
   algae produced considerably less CDOM (e.g. Pelvetia canaliculata),
   which were more comparable to the green and red species. Over an
   exposure time of 16 days, significant photochemical degradation of CDOM
   was observed using a natural summer sunlight regime, showing that
   natural solar radiation could be an important removal mechanism for
   newly produced algal CDOM. Though the most obvious effect was a decrease
   in absorption, photo-bleaching also caused a significant increase in the
   spectral slope parameter of 0.004 nm(-1). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Mackenzie River Delta, a floodplain system in the western Canadian
   Arctic contains approximately 45,000 lakes used by resident and
   migratory fish, aquatic birds, and mammal populations, which are
   critical resources for aboriginal peoples. Our results show the
   Mackenzie Delta is a remarkably productive aquatic ecosystem, not out of
   place relative to other large river floodplains and unusually productive
   for its Arctic latitude. Along with other such deltas of north flowing
   rivers to the Arctic Ocean, it represents a critical habitat of high
   productivity to support dependent consumers. Our results also showed a
   consistent under-saturation of CO2 in lake waters of the delta,
   co-occurring even with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon,
   and indicating P:R greater than 1 during the open water period. In less
   turbid lakes, abundant macrophytes provide a considerable surface area
   for supporting production of epiphyton, but epiphyton production is
   constrained strongly by macrophyte shading, when macrophyte biomass is
   high. Despite this, epiphyton represented a greater supply of
   non-macrophyte algal carbon than phytoplankton, and thus explains why
   benthic algae may be a more important food source for primary consumers
   than phytoplankton, except in the most turbid systems. Most importantly,
   the high autotrophic production in the Delta lakes relative to nearby
   lakes on the arctic tundra suggests the extended ice-free season of the
   floodplain lakes and their landscape setting on, and replenishment by,
   nutrient-rich river sediments, is the strongest influence on aquatic
   production levels.}},

Abstract = {{Production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by heterotrophic microbial
   communities isolated from Loch Creran (Scotland) was studied in time
   course incubations in which cells were re-suspended in artificial
   seawater amended with variable proportions of glucose, ammonium and
   phosphate. The incubation experiments demonstrated that
   microheterotrophs released part of the substrate as new DOM, with a
   production efficiency of 11 +/- 1\% for DOC, 18 +/- 2\% for DON and 17
   +/- 2\% for DOP. Estimating the impact of this production in Loch
   Creran, showed that from 3 +/- 1\% (DOC) to 72 +/- 16\% (DOP) of DOM
   could originate from the heterotrophic microbial community. The produced
   DOM (PDOM) was both bioavailable (BDOM) and refractory (RDOM).
   Bioavailability as assessed by the difference between the maximum and
   the end DOM concentration, was generally higher than found in natural
   systems, with DOP (73 +/- 15\%, average +/- SD) more bioavailable than
   DON (70 +/- 15\%), and DON than DOC (34 +/- 13\%). The stoichiometry of
   PDOM was linked to both nutrient uptake and BDOM ratios. Absorption and
   fluorescence of DOM increased significantly during the incubation time,
   indicating that microheterotrophs were also a source of coloured DOM
   (CDOM) and that they produce both bioavailable protein-like and
   refractory humic-like fluorophores. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Natural organic matter (NOM) is significant in determining fate,
   transport and toxicity of metals in aqueous systems but NOM is not a
   static component: NOM can undergo photochemical changes in chemical
   structure. These changes will modify NOM quality and in turn influence
   how metals are transported in the environment, as well as their toxicity
   to aquatic organisms. Natural organic matter was collected from five
   freshwater sources using a portable reverse osmosis unit, diluted to
   about 10 mg CL-1, then exposed for 13 days to summer temperatures either
   in the dark or exposed to sunlight. Light exposed NOM had decreases in
   total organic carbon (TOC) of 8-35\% compared to samples kept in a
   refrigerator (dark, 4 degrees C). and the NOM became optically lighter,
   as shown by specific absorbance coefficients (SAC) taken at 340 nm
   (55-76\% decreases in SAC(340)). In contrast, dark exposed NOM showed
   much smaller decreases in TOC (<= 3\%) or SAC(340) (<= 32\%). For light
   exposed samples fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy
   showed loss of fluorescence mainly in the 330 nm excitation, 420-450 nm
   emission range, consistent with loss of fulvic- and humic-like, aromatic
   groups in the NOM. Commercial (Aldrich) humic acid showed similar
   changes when exposed to light, with decreases in fulvic and humic
   fluorescence peaks. Finely ground fish food, used as a source of
   protein-rich organic matter, showed similar decreases in TOC and
   SAC(340) when exposed to light, but showed increased SAC(340) in the
   foil wrapped samples, presumably because bacteria were involved in
   decomposition of the food organic matter. Overall, these results
   indicate photodegradation of terrestrially derived, aromatic functional
   groups (e.g.. from lignin) in natural organic matter from various
   freshwater sources. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Strong tidal currents, shallow water and numerous freshwater inputs
   characterize the coastal waters of the eastern English Channel. These
   case 2 waters were investigated through an intensive sampling effort in
   2000 aiming to study the distribution and variability of the
   Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Non-Algal Particles (NAP)
   and phytoplankton absorption at the mesoscale. Four cruises were carried
   out in February, March, May and July and more than 80 stations each
   cruise were sampled for hydrographical, chemical and bio-optical
   analyses. Results showed two distinct situations, the winter period
   characterized by the strong dominance of CDOM absorption over the
   particulate matter, and the spring-summer period when phytoplankton and
   CDOM represented the same contribution. Meteorology was the main factor
   driving the bio-optical properties of the water column in winter whereas
   in spring-summer the biological activity seemed to be the more active
   driving force. The algal community composition in term of dominant cell
   size and, therefore pigment packaging, is the main factor driving the
   phytoplankton specific absorption in the water column. Photoprotective
   pigments did not significantly influence algal absorption, due to turbid
   and highly mixed water masses. This feature also explained the
   bio-optical homogeneity found along the water column. On the mesoscale,
   distinct bio-optical provinces were defined in relation with the
   observed bio-hydrographical variability. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Bacterial degradation of mucilaginous aggregates (creamy layers,
   stringers and macroflocs) collected during two summer events (2001-2002)
   was tested. The objective was to describe the temporal trend of the
   bacterial activity, abundance and composition in the aggregated and
   dissolved organic matter under different trophic conditions.
   In the native aggregates proteins and organic phosphorous were actively
   hydrolyzed as aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase activities
   represented up to 87\% and 25\% of total activity, respectively;
   polysaccharides were less hydrolyzed and the highest activities were
   observed for beta-glucosidase (5\% of the total). This hydrolysation
   pattern tends to a progressive accumulation of long persistent
   polysaccharides.
   During short term incubations nutrient addition (P, N and Glucose)
   differently stimulated bacterial growth in the seawater: P played the
   main role in stimulating bacterial production from 3 to 6 folds higher
   than in the control, whereas a secondary Climitation was observed only
   for bacteria growing on seawater from macroflocs. This scarce dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) bioavailability was confirmed by the lower DOC
   removal (13\% macroflocs, 36\% stringers). The total amount of carbon
   incorporated by bacteria living on aggregates was similar (0.58 mg C
   L-1) both in the control and under P enrichments showing a more balanced
   condition with respect to the seawater. Hence the well-known P
   limitation in the Northern Adriatic Sea affects only dissolved organic
   carbon uptake without influencing the uptake of aggregated organic
   matter.
   Organic matter limitation was observed only on stringers-total C
   incorporated raised to 0.96 mg C L-1 after PNG addition. Macroflocs
   release of refractory compounds leads to DOC accumulation (73 mu M DOC)
   contributing to inflate the pool of refractory DOC in the surrounding
   waters. Several evidences, including different monosaccharide
   composition of stringers and macroflocs (glucose 15\% and 56\% on
   stringers and macroflocs, respectively), bring to the conclusion that
   stringers are in an older stage in comparison with macroflocs. Community
   composition described by fluorescence in situ hybridization did not show
   significant differences between free-living and attached bacteria but it
   was modified by the different enrichment conditions:
   Cytophaga-Flavobacteria increased after inorganic nutrients enrichments
   while organics advantaged gamma-Proteobacteria. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Compositions of ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter (UDOM) and
   ultrafiltered particulate organic matter (UPOM) were characterized in
   samples collected from a depth profile (20-4000 m) in the North Pacific
   at Station Aloha. C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analyses
   together with delta C-13 values, carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios and
   molecular characterizations of UDOM and UPOM indicate different bulk
   chemical compositions and sources for these two size fractions.
   Carbohydrates and amino acids are the major biomolecules present in UDOM
   and UPOM. At all depths, UPOM had higher amino acid and lower
   carbohydrate contents compared to UDOM. UDOM and UPOM samples showed a
   decrease in the relative contribution of carbohydrates to the total
   organic carbon with increasing depth, whereas the contributions of
   lipids increased. Amino acids did not show any clear depth trends for
   UDOM, but decreased in UPOM. The compositional trends with depth
   indicate that selective degradation processes, which preferentially
   remineralize reactive biomolecules such as carbohydrates, affect UDOM
   and UPOM compositions in the water column.
   Molecular analyses of carbohydrates and amino acids characterized
   similar to 9\% of the C in UDOM and similar to 28\% of the C in UPOM.
   Although a relatively small proportion of the total C was
   characterizable with molecular analyses, the depth trends and the ratio
   of amino acids to carbohydrates in UPOM and UDOM were similar to those
   determined by C-13 NMR. This suggests that the organic matter fraction
   characterized by molecular analyses is representative of the molecularly
   uncharacterized fraction of organic matter. It is postulated that the
   molecularly uncharacterized fraction is encapsulated or shielded by a
   hydrolysis-resistant matrix or the individual amino acid and sugar units
   have been altered to form a chemical entity unrecognizable by the
   molecular analyses. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved proteins in seawater samples from the Gulf of Mexico were
   concentrated using tangential flow ultrafiltration and
   methanol/chloroform/water precipitation. Following concentration and
   purification, two different separation methods were employed. In one
   method, intact proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and digested
   enzymatically in-gel. In the second method, the peptides resulting from
   a solution proteolytic digest of the whole protein pellet mixture were
   separated by capillary HPLC. In both methods, the final chromatographic
   separation was coupled on-line with a mass spectrometer using an
   electrospray interface, and peptide CID spectra were collected using
   tandem mass spectrometry (MS). De novo sequencing of the peptide tandem
   mass spectra generated short amino acid sequences (peptide tags) that
   were used to search databases for protein class and source information.
   Trends of conserved sequences for two specific classes of proteins were
   observed: membrane/envelope proteins and enzymes. Similarity searching
   of peptide tags produced identification of conserved sequences from
   several protein homologues originating from many different species,
   including: long chain fatty acyl CoA synthetase, anthranilate
   synthase,ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, and luminal binding protein.
   These results provide new insight into the sources and production
   mechanisms for dissolved organic matter (DOM), as there is direct
   evidence for dissolved proteins other than the bacterial outer membrane
   proteins reported by Tanoue et al. Furthermore, the data presented
   herein support the idea that physical protection and selective
   preservation are not mutually exclusive survival mechanisms, but rather
   these two models are dependent upon one another for explaining the
   survival of refractory dissolved proteins in seawater. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{On the basis of input from in situ measurements of key parameters
   determining optical properties (i.e., snow grain size, density, ice
   salinity, ice temperature, etc.) we calculate the transmittance of
   shortwave radiation (280 nm < lambda < 800 nm) through first-year sea
   ice with and without snow cover. We use a multistream radiative transfer
   code that takes into account the coupling between two strata with
   different indices of refraction (i.e., the atmosphere-snow stratum and
   the ice-ocean stratum). Also, we give a detailed description of the
   parameterization used to calculate the optical properties for shortwave
   radiation in the atmosphere, snow, ice, and ocean. Through comparisons
   between calculated and in situ measured transmittances we tune the model
   to obtain consistency. We find that for the type of snow and ice
   considered in this study a 2.5-cm-thick layer of snow is less
   transparent than a 61-cm- thick layer of ice. Also, the diffuse
   attenuation coefficient for snow K-d varies considerably with the snow
   thickness, emphasizing the need for accurate radiative transfer
   modeling. Our model not only provides accurate transmittances but also
   gives accurate values for ultraviolet and visible light versus depth in
   the atmosphere, snow, ice, and ocean. This makes it a suitable tool for
   both calculating energy deposition in icy polar waters and predicting
   effects on polar aquatic ecology due to changes in the light conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the size and neutral aldose (NAld) composition of
   phytoplankton photosynthetic products during the early diagenetic
   process were experimentally examined using C-13 as a tracer. Most
   (94.7\%) of the photosynthetically produced (P-) organic carbon (OC) was
   found to be particulate organic carbon (POC) after a 12-h light
   incubation. An increase in the concentration of P-dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) was found after the shift to the dark incubation, probably
   due to a leakage of cellular constituents. An increase in the
   concentration of P-DOC was mainly due to an increase in the high
   molecular weight (HMW: >10 kDa) fraction that reached its maximum
   concentration on day 3 and then declined at a relatively high rate. The
   change in the concentration of the low molecular weight (LMW: <10 kDa)
   DOC fraction was less marked than that in the HMW fraction, and the rate
   of decrease was much slower, indicating a more biorefractory nature of
   P-LMW DOC. P-dissolved carbohydrates (DCHO) accounted for 38\% and 50\%
   in P-HMW DOC and P-LMW DOC, respectively, after a 12-h light incubation.
   The concentration of P-LMW DCHO showed a rapid decrease in the early
   stage of the dark incubation, whereas the concomitant increase in the
   concentration of P-LMW dissolved noncarbohydrate (DnonCHO) was noticed.
   The decrease in the contribution of CHO was noticed both in P-POC and
   P-HMW DOC fractions, but the decline rates were slower than that in
   P-LMW DOC fraction. On day 60, the remaining P-OC accounted for 4.6\% of
   photosynthetic material originally produced. The distribution of the
   size fractions of the remaining P-OC on day 60 (POC, 14\%; HMW DOC,
   22\%; LMW DOC, 64\%) indicates that phytoplankton photosynthetic
   products were rapidly degraded to the less bioreactive LMW DOM during
   early diagenesis. The present results indicate that the annual global
   ocean production rate of semilabile DOC with lifetimes exceeding 2
   months is 1.91 PgC yr(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Blooms of phototrophic cryptophytes have been observed in the highly
   eutrophic estuarine Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain (DZBC), Germany, during
   prolonged periods of light limitation due to ice and snow covering. The
   present study analyses possible mechanisms by which Rhodomonas salina,
   as a surrogate for bloom forming DZBC cryptophytes, maintains large
   densities during these low light/low temperature conditions. Growth,
   photosynthetic activity and pigment content were examined under 16
   combinations of temperature (5 to 20degreesC) and irradiance (10 to 150
   mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)) under nutrient-saturated conditions in a
   seawater-based medium. R. salina was tested for its capacity to
   photoacclimate to different light intensities in relation to temperature
   by calculating the photoadaptive index E-k (light saturation point of
   photosynthesis, P-max/alpha). P-max, the maximum photosynthesis rate and
   alpha, the efficiency of light utilisation at limited light intensities
   remained unchanged with respect to irradiance for every temperature
   tested. Consequently Ek, the irradiance at which photosynthesis rate
   ceased to be light-limited was constant (mean 49 mumol photons m(-2)
   s(-1)) within the chosen range of irradiances. This indicated that R.
   salina failed to adapt to down-shift changes in the light regime, at
   least in terms of photosynthetic parameters. Pigmentation analyses
   supported these results showing no acclimation of pigment ratios with
   regard to growth irradiance for a particular temperature. The calculated
   irradiance needed for 0 net photosynthesis (E-c was about 26 mumol
   photons m(-2) s(-1) and did not show any significant variation in light
   or temperature. The failure of R. salina to respond to down-shift
   changes in the light regime did not result, however, in a reduction in
   growth at low irradiances (10 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Judging from
   these results, R. salina seems to pursue an alternative strategy to
   capture energy under low light conditions which we hypothesise to be
   uptake of dissolved organic carbon from the seawater-based medium.
   Follow-up research will concentrate on the relative contribution of
   heterotrophy to the overall nutrition of R. salina under white ice
   covering.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of lignin-related aromatic compounds is an important
   ecological process in the highly productive salt marshes of the
   southeastern United States, yet little is known about the mediating
   organisms or their catabolic pathways. Here we report the diversity of a
   gene encoding a key ring-cleaving enzyme of the beta -ketoadipate
   pathway, pcaH, amplified from bacterial communities associated with
   decaying Spartina alterniflora, the salt marsh grass that dominates
   these coastal systems, as well as from enrichment cultures with aromatic
   substrates (p-hydroxybenzoate, anthranilate, vanillate, and
   dehydroabietate). Sequence analysis of 149 pcaH clones revealed 85
   unique sequences. Thirteen of the 53 amino acid residues compared were
   invariant in the PcaH proteins, suggesting that these residues have a
   required catalytic or structural function. Fifty-eight percent of the
   clones matched sequences amplified from a collection of 36 bacterial
   isolates obtained from seawater, marine sediments, or senescent
   Spartina. Fifty-two percent of the pcaH clones could be assigned to the
   roseobacter group, a marine lineage of the class alpha -Proteobacteria
   abundant in coastal ecosystems. Another 6\% of the clones matched genes
   retrieved from isolates belonging to the genera Acinetobacter, Bacillus,
   and Stappia, and 42\% of the clones could not be assigned to a cultured
   bacterium based on sequence identity. These results suggest that the
   diversity of the genes encoding a single step in aromatic compound
   degradation in the coastal marsh examined is high.}},

Abstract = {{Organic ligands for copper(II) were isolated from lake waters in Lake
   Biwa and its river waters by immobilized metal ion affinity
   chromatography ({[}MAC), and were characterized by three-dimensional
   excitation/emission matrix spectroscopy (3DEEM) and fluorescence
   quenching titration. The results show that the contribution of total
   organic ligands was 0.63-4.68\% of the bulk dissolved organic matter
   (DOM), in terms of UV absorbance, in lake and river waters. Three
   characteristic excitation/emission (Ex/Em) fluorescence peaks were
   identified in organic ligands from both lake and river waters, at Ex/Em
   310-330/ 374-434 nm (Peak A), 250/414-454 nm (Peak B), and
   260-270/306-330 nm (Peak C). Peaks A and B were referred to as
   humic-like fluorescence, Peak C as protein-like fluorescence. All Ex/Em
   maxima of organic ligands in lake waters were shifted towards shorter
   wavelength, and the fluorescence intensities were higher than those in
   river waters. The results of fluorescence quenching titration show that
   the IMAC ligands were weak ligands, with conditional stability constants
   (logK'(CuL)) around 7.27 for river ligands, and 7.84-9.23 for lake
   ligands. The differences of fluorescence properties indicate the
   variability of fluorescent ligands between river terrestrial and lake
   aquatic environments.}},

   bacterial growth, which in turn increased growth of C. roenbergensis. P.
   minimum attained higher abundance, higher chlorophyll a content per cell
   and a higher cellular nitrogen (N) content when grown with HS addition.
   In the treatment with P. minimum and bacteria approximately 35\% of the
   humic-associated N was utilized by the organisms, as indicated by the
   increase of particulate N in P. minimum and bacteria cells. There was no
   net accumulation of inorganic N in any treatment. indicating that
   bacteria acted as a sink for N when utilizing the I-IS as substrate.
   Moreover, grazing activity by C. roenbergensis did not cause any
   significant accumulation of inorganic N in treatments with C.
   roenbergensis and bacteria, suggesting that bacteria used the inorganic
   N released by the grazers. Thus. the increased growth of P. minimum with
   HS present was probably not caused by bacterial mineralization of

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter in the form of riverine humic substances
   stimulated the growth of both axenic nitrogen-limited Alexandrium
   catenella cultures and nitrogen-limited cultures with a marine bacterial
   community present. The biomass increase of A. catenella could not be
   accounted for by utilization of inorganic nitrogen compounds. However,
   there was a considerable release of dissolved free and combined amino
   acids from the humic substances that was utilized by A. catenella. About
   40\% of the nitrogen used by A. catenella in the axenic treatment with
   humic substances added was taken up as organic nitrogen. Bacterial
   aminopeptidase and beta-glucosidase activity was stimulated by the
   addition of humic substances and bacterial growth increased
   several-fold. Bacteria also utilized the released amino acids from the
   humic substances, but did not remineralize nitrogen, since no increase
   in ammonium concentrations could be detected in the bacteria treatments
   with humic substances added. In the axenic A. catenella treatment there
   was no significant aminopeptidase activity, suggesting that A. catenella
   was able to utilize the dissolved combined amino acids directly.
   Moreover. large fluorescently labeled dextran molecules (2000 kDa) were
   taken up by A. catenella in the humic treatments, showing up in vacuoles
   inside the cells. These results suggests that A. catenella can grow well
   utilizing macromolecular organic compounds containing nitrogen, probably
   by a direct uptake.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance, composition and bacterial colonization of macroscopic
   organic aggregates (lake snow) were studied from March until November
   1993 in Lake Constance, Germany. In addition, the concentration of
   particulate organic carbon (POC) and the amount, composition, and
   bacterial colonization of particulate matter (PM) collected in a
   sediment trap deployed at 50 m were investigated. The seasonal and
   vertical dynamics of lake snow and of sinking PM were closely Linked to
   those of phytoplankton blooms in spring. summer, and fall and to
   sedimentation losses of zooplankton during the clear-water phase. POC in
   lake snow comprised between 0.15 and 28\% of total POC in the
   surrounding water. On the other hand, sinking losses of POC bound in
   lake snow as estimated from the abundance, POC content and potential
   sinking rates of lake snow comprised much higher percentages, indicating
   the significance of these aggregates for the POC sinking flux.
   Particulate combined amino acids comprised 8 to 51\% of lake snow POC
   and were turned over in <20 h as determined from high rates of
   aminopeptidase activity. A rapid release of dissolved amino acids from
   sediment trap material into the surrounding water was shown
   experimentally indicating that the rapid POM decomposition in the
   aphotic zone leads to a supply of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to
   planktonic bacteria at this depth. However, in the same type of
   experiments we found that dissolved amino acids were taken up by the
   bacteria associated with the settled material when it was deprived of
   labile organic substrates. This finding complicates the 1-way concept of
   bacterially mediated interactions between POM and DOM in aquatic
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that protein adsorbed to submicron particles in
   seawater is more slowly degraded than the same protein freely dissolved.
   Bacterial hydrolysis of methyl-H-3-bovine serum albumin (H-3-BSA)
   dissolved or adsorbed to particles (polystyrene latex beads, diameters
   0.126 to 1.5 mu m) was examined. Mixed bacterial assemblages cultured on
   BSA media, 2 bacterial isolates, and a natural marine bacterial
   assemblage hydrolyzed adsorbed H-3-BSA at much slower rates (1/10 to
   <1/200) than free H-3-BSA. We compared our hydrolysis rates with the
   predicted collision probabilities between bacteria and H-3-BSA freely
   dissolved or adsorbed to beads of different diameters. These comparisons
   suggest that the hydrolysis rate is influenced primarily by the
   transport rate of H-3-BSA to bacteria. Hydrolysis of adsorbed H-3-BSA
   differed greatly between 2 bacterial strains, which appears to be
   explained by differences in the affinity of bacterial proteases to
   H-3-BSA. Our results support the hypothesis that adsorption onto
   submicron particles greatly reduces degradation rate of proteins and
   suggest that the adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) may be a
   mechanism that temporarily stores labile DOM in a slowly degrading,
   `semi-labile' pool, which makes it available for export and further
   modification by geochemical processes.}},

Abstract = {{The significance of dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA), dissolved

   phosphorus was not limiting. Maximum bacterial particulate organic
   carbon production (after 25 h of incubation) was inversely correlated
   with the C/N ratio: with the addition of identical amounts of carbon,
   the levels of production were 9.0-, 10.0-, and 11.1-fold higher at C/N
   ratios of 15, 10, and 5, respectively, relative to an unamended control.
   The bacterial growth efficiency increased from 22\% (control cultures)
   to 44 to 53\% in the cultures with manipulated C/N ratios
   (C/N-manipulated cultures). Net carbon incorporation from DCAA, DFAA,

   3.4-fold-higher level of incorporation of DCAA, relative to that in the
   control cultures, occurred. Incorporation of D-DNA increased with the
   substrate C/N ratio, suggesting that D-DNA mainly was a source of N to
   the bacteria. Organic N (DCAA, DFAA, and D-DNA) sustained 14 to 49\% of
   the net bacterial N production. NH4+ was the dominant N source and
   constituted 55 to 99\% of the total N uptake. NO3- contributed up to
   23\% to the total N uptake but was released in two cultures. The studied
   N compounds sustained nearly all of the bacterial N demand. Our results
   show that the C/N ratio of dissolved organic matter available to
   bacteria has a significant influence on the incorporation of individual
   compounds like DCAA and D-DNA.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial nitrogen regeneration processes are an important source of
   nitrogen in the most productive regions of the Mississippi River plume
   (Gulf of Mexico). We examined bacterial growth rates, ammonium
   regeneration rates, and labile dissolved organic carbon/nitrogen fluxes
   on 2 cruises in the Mississippi River plume. In summer, surface water
   bacterial production rates, ammonium regeneration rates, and amino acid
   turnover rates were higher at intermediate salinities than corresponding
   rates at the river mouth or in high salinity waters. In winter, surface
   amino acid turnover rates were highest in the river but growth rates
   were highest in the plume and ammonium regeneration rates were similar
   at all sites. Regeneration rates in the plume were an order of magnitude
   greater in the summer than in the winter. A significant proportion of
   the bacterial nitrogen demand may be provided by amino acid fluxes in
   summer, especially in the plume. Measurements of NH4 regeneration after
   manipulating bacterial abundances suggest that heterotrophic bacteria
   contributed a variable proportion (7 to 50 \%) of total N-regeneration
   in summer and that dissolved free amino acids could be a major substrate
   for ammonium regeneration. Depth profiles, spatial distributions, and
   seasonal differences in ammonium regeneration rates imply that the
   fastest regeneration rates occur spatially and temporally where primary
   production is the greatest.}},

   Photochemical production under strong biological activity might be

   peroxide in the Seto Inland Sea gave a good correlation with salinity,
   suggesting that the photosensitizer to produce hydrogen peroxide was
   substances brought from river waters.
   Hydrated electron as a possible precursor of hydrogen peroxide in the
   photochemical reaction was generated in seawater collected at the Seto
   Inland Sea by means of irradiating the third harmonic wave of the YAG
   laser (355 nm: 60 mJ): The amount generated showed a positive
   correlation against total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic

Abstract = {{The high biodiversity of coral reefs results in complex trophic webs
   where energy and nutrients are transferred between species through a
   multitude of pathways. Here, we hypothesize that reef sponges convert
   the dissolved organic matter released by benthic primary producers (e.g.
   corals) into particulate detritus that is transferred to
   sponge-associated detritivores via the sponge loop pathway. To test this
   hypothesis, we conducted stable isotope (C-13 and N-15) tracer
   experiments to investigate the uptake and transfer of coral-derived
   organic matter from the sponges Mycale fistulifera and Negombata
   magnifica to 2 types of detritivores commonly associated with sponges:
   ophiuroids (Ophiothrix savignyi and Ophiocoma scolopendrina) and
   polychaetes (Polydorella smurovi). Findings revealed that the organic
   matter naturally released by the corals was indeed readily assimilated
   by both sponges and rapidly released again as sponge detritus. This
   detritus was subsequently consumed by the detritivores, demonstrating
   transfer of coral-derived organic matter from sponges to their
   associated fauna and confirming all steps of the sponge loop. Thus,
   sponges provide a trophic link between corals and higher trophic levels,
   thereby acting as key players within reef food webs.}},

Abstract = {{Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an ultracomplex mixture that
   is essential to global carbon cycling but is poorly understood because
   of its complexity. The most powerful tool for the DOM characterization
   is high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) generally combined to direct
   infusion (DI) as sample introduction. Liquid chromatography (LC)
   represents a compelling alternative to DI; however, state-of-the-art
   techniques involve only offline LC-HRMS approaches, which have important
   logistical drawbacks that make DOM analysis more challenging. This study
   introduces a new method based on online coupling of liquid
   chromatography to high resolution mass spectrometry, able to overcome
   the disadvantages of usual approaches. It is characterized by high
   reproducibility (\% Bray-Curtis dissimilarity among replicates 2.5\%),
   and it reduces transient complexity and contaminant interferences, thus
   increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), leading to the
   identification of an overall larger number of formulas in the mixture.
   Moreover, the application of an in silico fractionation prior to the
   statistical analysis allows an easy, flexible, fast, and detailed
   comparison of DOM samples from a variety of sources with a single
   chromatographic run.}},

Abstract = {{Methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations can increase by 100 000 times
   between seawater and marine phytoplankton, but levels vary across sites.
   To better understand how ecosystem properties affect variability in
   planktonic MeHg concentrations, we develop a model for MeHg uptake and
   trophic transfer at the base of marine food webs. The model successfully
   reproduces measured concentrations in phytoplankton and zooplankton
   across diverse sites from the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. Highest MeHg
   concentrations in phytoplankton are simulated under low dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and ultraoligotrophic conditions
   typical of open ocean regions. This occurs, because large organic
   complexes bound to MeHg inhibit cellular uptake and cell surface area to
   volume ratios are greatest under low productivity conditions. Modeled
   bioaccumulation factors for phytoplankton (10(2.4)-10(5.9)) are more
   variable than those for zooplankton (10(4.6)-10(6.2)) across ranges in
   DOC (40-500 mu M) and productivities (ultraoligotrophic to
   hypereutrophic) typically found in marine ecosystems. Zooplankton growth
   dilutes their MeHg body burden, but they also consume greater quantities
   of MeHg enriched prey at larger sizes. These competing processes lead to
   lower variability in MeHg concentrations in zooplankton compared to
   phytoplankton. Even under hypereutrophic conditions, modeled growth
   dilution in marine zooplankton is insufficient to lower their MeHg
   concentrations, contrasting findings from freshwater ecosystems.}},

Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{The submarine hydrothermal systems are extreme environments where active
   cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) may occur. However, little is
   known about the optical properties and bioavailability of hydrothermal
   DOM, which could provide valuable insights into its transformation
   processes and biogeochemical reactivity. The quantity, quality, and
   bioavailability of DOM were investigated for four very different
   hydrothermal vents east of Taiwan, using dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   absorption spectroscopy, and fluorescence excitation-emission
   matrices-parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). The DOC and absorption
   coefficient C1280 were both lower in the two hydrothermal vents off the
   Orchid Island and on the Green Island than in the surrounding seawater
   and the two vents off the Kueishantao Island, indicating effective
   removals of DOM in the former two hydrothermal systems owing to possible
   adsorption/co-precipitation and thermal degradation respectively. The
   four hydrothermal DOM showed notable differences in the absorption
   spectral slope S275-295, humification index HIX, biological index BIX,
   EEM spectra, and the relative distributions of seven PARAFAC components.
   The results demonstrated a high diversity of chemical composition and
   transformation history of DOM under contrasting hydro thermal
   conditions. The little change in the hydrothermal DOC after 28-day
   microbial incubations indicated a low bioavailability of the bulk DOM,
   and different PARAFAC components showed contrasting bioavailability. The
   results have profound implications for understanding the biogeochemical
   cycling and environmental effects of hydrothermal DOM in the marine
   environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effects of halide ions on photodegradation of sulfonamide antibiotics:
   Formation of halogenated intermediates}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{102}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) in estuarine waters
   urges insights into their environmental fate for ecological risk
   assessment. Although many studies focused on the photochemical behavior
   of SAs, yet the effects of halide ions relevant to estuarine and marine
   environments on their photodegradation have been poorly understood.
   Here, we investigated the effects of halide ions on the photodegradation
   of SAs with sulfapyridine, sulfamethazine, and sulfamethoxazole as
   representative compounds. Results showed that halide ions did not
   significantly impact the photodegradation of sulfapyridine and
   sulfamethoxazole, while they significantly promoted the photodegradation
   of sulfamethazine. Further experiments found that ionic strength applied
   with NaClO4 significantly enhanced the photodegradation of the SAs,
   which was attributed to the decreased quenching rate constant of the
   triplet-excited SAs ((3)SA{*}). Compared with ionic strength, specific
   effects retarded the photo degradation of the SAs. Our study found that
   triplet-excited sulfamethazine can oxidize halide ions to produce
   halogen radicals, subsequently leading to the halogenation of
   sulfamethazine, which was confirmed by the identification of both
   chlorinated and brominated intermediates. These results indicate that
   halide ions play an important role in the photochemical behavior of some
   SAs in estuarine waters and seawater. The occurrence of halogenation for
   certain organic pollutants can be predicted by comparing the oxidation
   potentials of triplet-excited contaminants with those of halogen
   radicals. Our findings are helpful in understanding the photochemical
   behavior and assessing the ecological risks of SAs and other organic
   pollutants in estuarine and marine environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The decay of sewage-sourced Escherichia coli and enterococci was
   measured at multiple depths in a freshwater marsh, a brackish water
   lagoon, and a marine site, all located in California. The marine site
   had very clear water, while the waters from the marsh and lagoon
   contained colored dissolved organic matter that not only blocked light
   but also produced reactive oxygen species. First order decay rate
   constants of both enterococci and E. coli were between 1 and 2 d(-1)
   under low light conditions and as high as 6 d(-1) under high light
   conditions. First order decay rate constants were well correlated to the
   daily average UVB light intensity corrected for light screening
   incorporating water absorbance and depth, suggesting endogenous
   photoinactivation is a major pathway for bacterial decay. Additional
   laboratory experiments demonstrated the presence of colored dissolved
   organic matter in marsh water enhanced photoinactivation of a laboratory
   strain of Enterococcus faecalis, but depressed photoinactivation of
   sewage-sourced enterococci and E. coli after correcting for UVB light
   screening, suggesting that although the exogenous indirect
   photoinactivation mechanism may be active against Ent. faecalis, it is
   not for the sewage-source organisms. A simple linear regression model
   based on UVB light intensity appears to be a useful tool for predicting
   inactivation rate constants in natural waters of any depth and
   absorbance.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a large and high quality dataset of total organic carbon (TOC,
   an approximation of dissolved organic carbon) collected from three
   cruises in spring, fall and winter in 2009-2011, we examined the
   distribution of TOC and its seasonality in the oligotrophic regime of
   the Northern South China Sea (NSCS) as well as its exchanges with the
   West Philippine Sea (WPS) in the Northwest Pacific Ocean through the
   Luzon Strait, the only deep channel linking the South China Sea (SCS)
   and the Pacific Ocean. Surface TOC concentration in the slope and basin
   areas of the NSCS varied from 65 to 75 mu mol L-1 with relatively high
   values in the northeast part (southwest of Taiwan Island) in spring, and
   in the eastern parts of the NSCS during fall and winter. The TOC
   inventory in the upper 100 m of the water column ranged from 6.0-7.5 mol
   m(-2) with a similar distribution pattern as the surface TOC
   concentration. There were two most significant differences in the TOC
   profiles between the SCS and the WPS. One was in the upper 200 m, where
   more TOC was accumulated in the WPS; the other was in the intermediate
   layer at similar to 1000-1500 m, where the gradient of TOC concentration
   was still persistent below 1000 m in the SCS, a feature which did not
   exist in the WPS. At this intermediate layer, there also appeared an
   excess of TOC in the SCS as compared with that in the WPS. The TOC
   concentration below 2000 m in the SCS was identical to that in the
   Northwestern Pacific, both of which were 40 mu mol L-1 without
   significant difference among stations and seasons, suggesting that this
   deep water TOC was homogeneously distributed in the deep SCS basin owing
   to the fast replenishment of the deep water from the WPS. We adopted an
   isopycnal mixing model to derive the water proportion contributed
   respectively from the SCS and Kuroshio along individual isopycnal plane
   and examined the impact of the Kuroshio intrusion on the TOC in the
   NSCS. The upper 100 m TOC inventory in the NSCS was overall positively
   correlated with the Kuroshio water fraction, suggesting that the
   Kuroshio intrusion enhanced the TOC inventory thereby significantly
   influencing TOC distribution in the NSCS. Following the sandwich
   structure of water exchange through the Luzon Strait, with an inflow in
   the surface and deep layer but an outflow from the SCS in the
   intermediate layer, we conducted a first order estimation of the TOC
   transport fluxes based on the reported cross strait volume transport.
   The TOC transport flux was -107.1 +/- 54.6, 54.7 +/- 15.0 and -16.4 +/-
   13.1 Tg C yr(-1) at the upper, intermediate and deep layer,
   respectively. Note that the positive sign means that the flux was from
   the SCS to the WPS. By integrating the three-layers, the total net
   transport flux of TOC through the Luzon Strait would be -68.8 +/- 58.0
   Tg C yr(-1). Because of the great spatialtemporal variability of the
   water flow across the Luzon Strait, these first order TOC flux estimates
   were subject to large uncertainty. Nevertheless, because the SCS is
   featured by higher DOC production, the exchange of these fluxes with the
   open ocean interior where DOC would have experienced more degradation
   would have important implications for both the microbial community in
   the ocean interior and overall carbon cycle in the SCS. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Understanding the temporal dynamics of present thermal and pH exposure
   on coral reefs is crucial for elucidating reef response to future global
   change. Diel ranges in temperature and carbonate chemistry parameters
   coupled with seasonal changes in the mean conditions define periods
   during the year when a reef habitat is exposed to anomalous thermal
   and/or pH exposure. Anomalous conditions are defined as values that
   exceed an empirically estimated threshold for each variable. We present
   a 200-day time series from June through December 2010 of carbonate
   chemistry and environmental parameters measured on the Heron Island reef
   flat. These data reveal that aragonite saturation state, pH, and pCO(2)
   were primarily modulated by biologically-driven changes in dissolved
   organic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA), rather than salinity and
   temperature. The largest diel temperature ranges occurred in austral
   spring, in October (1.5 - 6.6 degrees C) and lowest diel ranges (0.9 -
   3.2 degrees C) were observed in July, at the peak of winter. We observed
   large diel total pH variability, with a maximum range of 7.7 - 8.5 total
   pH units, with minimum diel average pH values occurring during spring
   and maximum during fall. As with many other reefs, the nighttime pH
   minima on the reef flat were far lower than pH values predicted for the
   open ocean by 2100. DIC and TA both increased from June (end of Fall) to
   December (end of Spring). Using this high-resolution dataset, we
   developed exposure metrics of pH and temperature individually for
   intensity, duration, and severity of low pH and high temperature events,
   as well as a combined metric. Periods of anomalous temperature and pH
   exposure were asynchronous on the Heron Island reef flat, which
   underlines the importance of understanding the dynamics of co-occurrence
   of multiple stressors on coastal ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Within intertidal sediments, much of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   consists of carbohydrate-rich extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)
   produced by microphytobenthic biofilms. EPS are an important source of
   carbon and energy for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms owing to
   burial of microphytobenthos and downward transport of their exudates. We
   established slurries of estuarine biofilms to determine the fate of
   organic carbon and EPS fractions, differing in size and complexity,
   under oxic and anoxic conditions. DOC and hot-water-extracted organic
   matter (predominately diatom chrysolaminarin) were utilised rapidly at
   similar rates in both conditions. Concentrations of insoluble,
   high-molecular-weight EPS were unchanged in oxic microcosms, but were
   significantly degraded under anoxic conditions (39\% degradation by day
   25). Methanogenesis and sulphate reduction were major anaerobic
   processes in the anoxic slurries, and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing
   revealed that Desulfobacteraceae (relative sequence abundance increased
   from 1.9\% to 12.2\%) and Desulfobulbaceae (increased from 1.5\% to
   4.3\%) were the main sulphate reducers, whilst Clostridia and
   Bacteroidetes were likely responsible for anaerobic hydrolysis and
   fermentation of EPS. We conclude that a diverse consortium of anaerobic
   microorganisms (including coexisting sulphate reducers and methanogens)
   degrade both labile and refractory microphytobenthic-derived carbon and
   that anaerobic degradation may be the primary fate of more structurally
   complex components of microphytobenthic EPS.}},

Abstract = {{Continental shelves are believed to play a major role in carbon cycling
   due to their high productivity. To improve our understanding of carbon
   dynamics on continental margins, a dissolved organic matter (DOM) model
   was developed and imbedded within an existing coupled ocean
   circulation-biogeochemical model of the U.S. East coast. A model
   simulation with the DOM module was compared with the reference model
   (without the DOM module) to illustrate the role of DOM dynamics in
   coastal ocean biogeochemical cycling. Model results reveal that the
   progressive release of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the ocean's
   upper layer during summer increases the regenerated primary production
   by 30-300\%, which, in turn, enhances the dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   production mainly from phytoplankton exudation in the upper layer and
   solubilization of particulate organic matter (POM) deeper in the water
   column. This analysis suggests that DOM is a necessary component for
   representing ecosystem functioning and organic fluxes in models because
   DOM (1) is a major organic pool directly related to primary production,
   (2) decouples partially the carbon and nitrogen cycles (through carbon
   excess uptake, POM solubilization and DOM mineralization) and (3) is
   intimately linked to the residence time of water masses for its
   distribution and export. The seasonally produced DOC on the shelf can be
   exported to the open ocean by horizontal transport at comparable rates
   (1-2 mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) to particulate organic carbon burial in the
   southern U.S. Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Results from a study of benthic nitrogen cycling in two Arctic fjords
   are presented. Intact sediment core incubations were used to quantify
   net fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, organic nitrogen, organic
   carbon, and oxygen across the sediment-water interface. Rates of gross
   denitrification, anammox, nitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction
   to ammonium, and N-2 fixation were quantified using core incubations and
   slurry experiments. Profiles of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in
   pore-water, and organic carbon and nitrogen contents in the solid phase,
   were also obtained. Net nitrogen losses as N-2, measured directly as
   changes in N-2 : Ar, ranged from 152 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1) to 453 mu mol
   N m(-2) d(-1). Gross denitrification, as determined using N-15-NO3-
   tracers, was 34-294 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1). Rates of anammox ranged from
   10 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1) to 26 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1) and contributed
   5-23\% of gross N-2 generation. Nitrification rates were as high as 833
   mu mol N m(-2) d(-1) and sediments were a substantial source of nitrate
   to the water column (169-393 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1) efflux). Uptake of
   ammonium (52-87 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1)), dissolved organic nitrogen
   (291-486 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1)), and dissolved organic carbon (1313-2504
   mu mol N m(-2) d(-1)) were observed. Nitrogen loss from the seafloor is
   shown to occur at rates comparable to temperate coastal environments and
   the sediments provide a substantial source of nitrate to the water
   column of Arctic fjords. In addition, anammox is confirmed as an
   important pathway in Arctic marine sediments, although N-2 production is
   dominated by denitrification.}},

   nutrients, apparent oxygen utilization, Fe(III) hydroxide solubility,
   and humic-type fluorescence (H-flu) intensity. Dissolved Fe
   concentrations ({[}D-Fe], <0.22-mu m fraction) in the deep water column
   were one-half lower in the central region (0.3-0.6 nM) than the western
   region (0.5-1.2 nM) although the Fe(III) solubility ({[}Fe(III)sol],
   <0.025-mu m fraction) levels and distributions in deep waters were
   almost the same between both regions with middepth maxima (similar to
   0.6 nM) at 500-1500-m depth range and then a gradual decrease to similar
   to 0.3 nM at 5000-m depth. Higher {[}D-Fe] than {[}Fe(III)sol] in the
   deep water column of the western region results from the higher
   production of dissolved Fe from the decomposition of sinking particulate
   organic matter in the western region than the central region because of
   the high atmospheric and/or lateral Fe inputs in the western region.
   Similarity between {[}D-Fe] level and {[}Fe(III)sol] value at each deep
   water depth in the central region may be attributed to {[}D-Fe] being
   nearly in the solubility equilibrium with Fe(III) hydroxide in seawater.
   Strong linear correlation between {[}D-Fe] and H-flu intensity in the
   central region and relatively similar linear relationships between
   {[}Fe(III)sol] and H-flu intensity in the western and central regions
   are the first confirmation that humic-type fluorescent dissolved organic
   matter may be responsible for {[}D-Fe] in the deep water column as
   natural organic ligands complexing with Fe(III).}},

Abstract = {{Carbohydrates are one of the major biochemical groups in lakes and
   oceans. In cells, they are primary metabolic energy compounds, serving
   as storage for photosynthetically fixed carbon, and providing structural
   support. The cycling of carbohydrates in aquatic and terrestrial
   environments is important for determining food web interactions and for
   understanding fluxes of organic matter. We investigated
   compound-specific isotopic ratios of individual monomeric carbohydrates
   (i.e. sugars) from seven algal and cyanobacterial primary producers,
   three angiosperms and gymnosperms, two bacterial cultures, and seven
   marine invertebrates in order to determine the isotopic fractionation of
   these molecules relative to bulk carbon isotopic compositions. The
   carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of individual sugars varied
   greatly within an organism (7.6 +/- 4 parts per thousand), with the
   greatest range in zooplankton where sugar delta C-13 varied by 15 parts
   per thousand. The calculated delta C-13 of the total combined
   carbohydrate (TCC) pool for individual species was on average enriched
   in C-13 by 4.6 +/- 4 parts per thousand relative to the bulk C isotopic
   composition. However, whole cedar wood had TCC with isotopic
   compositions more depleted than bulk delta C-13 value. Glucose produced
   by heterotrophic organisms was enriched in C-13 relative to all other
   monosaccharides. These small, but potentially important, differences
   might be useful in tracing the flow of carbon in difficult to
   characterize pools of organic matter, such as the dissolved organic
   carbon in the ocean. The enrichment in C-13 of glucose produced in
   abundance by heterotrophs may be a controlling factor in the stepwise
   enrichment in carbon isotopes with increasing trophic level in food
   webs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Macroalgae, often the dominant primary producers in shallow estuaries,
   can be important regulators of nitrogen (N) cycling. Like phytoplankton,
   actively growing macroalgae release N to the water column; yet little is
   known about the quantity or nature of this release. Using N-15 labeling
   in laboratory and field experiments, we estimated the quantity of N
   released relative to assimilation and gross uptake by Gracilaria
   vermiculophylla (Ohmi) Papenfuss (Rhodophyta, Gracilariales), a
   non-native macroalgae. Field experiments were carried out in Hog Island
   Bay, a shallow back-barrier lagoon on the Virginia coast where G.
   vermiculophylla makes up 85\%-90\% of the biomass. There was good
   agreement between laboratory and field measurements of N uptake and
   release. Daily N assimilation in field experiments (32.3 +/- 7.2 mu mol
   N.g dw(-1).d(-1)) was correlated with seasonal and local N availability.
   The average rate of N release across all sites and dates (65.8 +/- 11.6
   mu mol N.g dw(-1).d(-1)) was 67\% of gross daily uptake, and also varied
   among sites and seasons (range=33\%-99\%). Release was highest when
   growth rates and nutrient availability were low, possibly due to
   senescence during these periods. During summer biomass peaks, estimated
   N release from macroalgal mats was as high as 17 mmol N.m(-2).d(-1). Our
   results suggest that most estimates of macroalgal N uptake severely
   underestimate gross N uptake and that N is taken up, transformed, and
   released to the water column on short time scales (minutes-hours).}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{299}},
Pages = {{7-17}},
Abstract = {{We studied the photosynthetic production of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOCp) during summer oligotrophic conditions in the Celtic Sea. The
   production rate of size-fractionated, particulate organic carbon (POCp)
   was also determined, as well as the relationship between irradiance and
   DOCp and the kinetics of DOCp during a 24 h light-dark cycle. Mean (1
   SE), euphotic layer-integrated POCp was 510 +/- 61 mg C m(-2) d(-1), and
   cells in the < 5 mu m size fraction accounted for 58 +/- 3 \% and 63 +/-
   4 \% of total integrated chlorophyll a concentration and POCp,
   respectively. The mean, integrated percentage of extracellular release
   {[}PER, calculated as DOCp / (DOCp + POCp)] was 22 +/- 2 \%. (DOC)-C-14
   accumulation stopped during the dark. In photosynthesis-irradiance
   experiments, DOCp remained constant across a wide irradiance range,
   despite the strong light dependence of POCp. These observations suggest
   that direct release from intact cells is the main pathway for DOCp.
   Significant DOCp took place throughout the euphotic layer and across a
   wide irradiance range, suggesting an important role for passive
   diffusion in the release of recent photosynthate. When comparing our
   measurements of DOCp in the Celtic Sea with previous observations in a
   coastal, eutrophic ecosystem, a remarkable continuity is observed, both
   in the relative significance and likely mechanisms of DOCp. Across a
   productivity range from < 100 to > 15 000 mg C m(-2) d(-1), PER was
   relatively constant at similar to 20\%, and integrated DOCp could be
   predicted from integrated POCp with the equation: log (DOCp) = 0.96 x
   log (POCp) - 0.51 (r(2) = 0.90, n = 35, p < 0.001).}},

Journal = {{AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{61-72}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{A phytoplankton bloom and decay sequence was created in 2 laboratory
   containers and mesozooplankton was added to one container before the
   peak of algal biomass. Each day for 22 d, the net production of
   autochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was measured and on 5
   occasions the degradation kinetics and the total pool of biodegradable
   DOC (BDOC) were assayed in experiments lasting 230 d. Net accumulation
   of new DOC was 235 and 280 muM in the containers with and without
   zooplankton, respectively. The best description of microbial DOC
   degradation was a 2-pool model and 1st order exponential decay. Without
   mesozooplankton present, the degradation experiments showed accumulation
   of a large pool of labile BDOC characterised by decay coefficients >0.2
   d(-1). The least labile pools in the 2 containers had similar
   coefficients (average 0.02 d(-1)). The amount of newly produced
   recalcitrant DOC (RDOC) accounted for about 12\% of new DOC. The
   differences observed with respect to degradation kinetics and net DOC
   production are explained by food web interactions and nutrient
   limitation. The presence of mesozooplankton resulted in high bacterial
   production keeping labile BDOC at low concentrations. In the container
   without mesozooplankton, the bacterial uptake capacity was reduced,
   probably by a combination of protist grazing and nutrient limitation.
   Consequently, about 75 muM BDOC with a half-life of less than 3 d
   accumulated during the experiment. Mineralisation of the accumulated
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) during microbial degradation in a
   nutrient replete environment was measured as the decrease in DOC and net
   mineralisation/immobilisation of inorganic N and P. The mineralisation
   of DOC was accompanied by low mineralisation of N and P and even
   immobilisation of phosphate during degradation of DOM produced in the
   container with mesozooplankton present. Bacterial production of DON and
   DOP is believed to result in a recalcitrant DOM pool enriched in N and
   P, and the activity of mesozooplankton seems to enhance this scenario.}},

   Interactions were followed over 10 d in 12, 3-m(3) seawater mesocosms in
   the Isefjord, Denmark. Two sets of four mesocosms were given the same
   daily addition of ``phytoplankton nutrients{''} (phosphate and nitrate)
   but received different amounts of glucose, and one set was kept in
   excess with respect to silicate. Four additional mesocosms served as
   controls and received either no additions, silicate alone, or glucose
   alone. In the mesocosm set where no silicate was added, enrichment with
   phytoplankton nutrients and glucose led to a replacement of diatoms, not
   by other algae, but by heterotrophic bacteria, mainly bacteria > 2 mum.
   In the mesocosm set where silicate was kept replete, diatoms competed
   successfully with bacteria for the uptake of mineral nutrients. Even in
   mesocosms enriched with high amounts of glucose, primary production
   increased throughout the experimental period, while bacterial
   production, after an initial increase, leveled off. In addition,
   turnover time of glucose increased in the silicate-replete mesocosm set,
   consistent with the idea that bacterial consumption was hampered by
   diatoms competing successfully for phosphate and nitrate. The size and
   shape of different algal and bacterial groups in relation to nutrient
   uptake and grazer avoidance are discussed. Both accumulation and
   consumption of dissolved organic carbon could depend on the. structure

Abstract = {{A primary production model, specific to the subtropical North Pacific,
   was developed using productivity and chlorophyll data collected at
   Station ALOHA (22.75 degreesN, 158.00 degreesW) and measured
   phytoplankton physiological parameters. The production algorithm is a
   mechanistic, full spectral model that provides depth-dependent
   photosynthesis rates. Six years of phytoplankton pigment data were
   analyzed to derive seasonal cycles and to parameterize chlorophyll a
   (Chl; monovinyl and divinyl chlorophyll a) versus depth profiles. The
   Chi profiles fit a Gaussian-type distribution with depth over a constant
   background concentration equal to mixed-layer values. Maximum Chi
   concentrations were always found below the surface, and the parameters
   displayed distinct monthly and seasonal patterns. Photosynthesis versus
   irradiance experiments were conducted at a number of locations and
   seasons in the vicinity of Station ALOHA to calculate phytoplankton
   physiological parameters needed for the computation of primary
   production rates. Relationships were explored between environmental
   conditions and the physiological and profile parameters in order to
   develop algorithms based on remotely sensed sea-surface variables and
   time of year. These relationships were used to model primary production
   rates using data collected during the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT)
   program. The performance of the model and model parameters were tested
   by comparing modeled results to those measured directly at Station ALOHA
   by trace metal-clean, in situ (14)C incubation techniques. Monthly
   averaged chlorophyll profile parameters and a constant maximum quantum
   yield (0.026 mol C (molquanta)(-1)) generates an annual production
   estimate of 168 g Cm(-2), which closely resembles that measured at
   Station ALOHA (181g C m(-2)) during the same period. The measured and
   modeled primary production rates for the subtropical North Pacific are
   twice as high as values derived from Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS)
   data (60-90gCm(-2)) during the period 1978-1986. If the study area near
   Station ALOHA is representative of most oligotrophic waters, current
   global estimates of primary production rates have been significantly

Abstract = {{The operation of the oceans biological CO(2) pump depends on both the
   structure of the pelagic food web and remineralization processes in the
   water column. We have developed a novel pelagic ecosystem model to study
   the effects on carbon export of food-web interactions in the euphotic
   zone and remineralization processes over the entire water column. The
   one-dimensional model consists of 10 state variables that span the
   herbivorous and microbial food webs. It is forced by solar radiation,
   vertical mixing, and the nitrate concentration in deep water. According
   to the model, adjusted against a CJGOFS data set, up to 52\% of the
   nitrate-based phytoplankton production is processed by the microbial
   food web before being exported from the euphotic zone. Remineralization
   of dissolved organic carbon and suspended particles in the water column
   is a key control on carbon export, and up to 77\% of the total material
   exported from the euphotic zone is remineralized in a layer located
   between the bottom of the euphotic zone and the annual maximum depth of
   the surface mixed layer. Nitrification of ammonia released within this
   layer satisfies most of the biological demand for nitrate in the
   euphotic zone. This places limitations on the use of new production as
   usually determined at sea (i.e. based on the uptake of nitrate) to
   estimate carbon export towards the deep. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{intertidal marine nucrobial mats exhibited biologically mediated uptake
   of low molecular weight dissolved organic matter (DOM), including
   D-glucose, acetate, and an L-amino acid mixture at trace concentrations.
   Uptake of all compounds occurred in darkness, but was frequently
   enhanced under natural illumination. The photosystem 2 inhibitor,
   343,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea (DCMU) generally failed to
   inhibit light-stimulated DOM uptake. Occasionally, light plus
   DCMU-amended treatments led to uptake rates higher than light-incubated
   samples, possibly due to phototrophic bacteria present in subsurface
   anoxic layers. Uptake was similar with either H-3- or C-14-labeled
   substrates, indicating that recycling of labeled CO2 via photosynthetic
   fixation was not interfering with measurements of light-stimulated DOM
   uptake. Microautoradiographs showed a variety of pigmented and
   nonpigmented bacteria and, to a lesser extent, cyanobacteria and
   eucaryotic microalgae involved in light-mediated DOM uptake.
   Light-stimulated DOM uptake was often observed in bacteria associated
   with sheaths and mucilage surrounding filamentous cyanobacteria,
   revealing a close association of organisms taking up DOM with
   photoautotrophic members of the mat community. The capacity for dark-
   and light-mediated heterotrophy, coupled to efficient retention of fixed
   carbon in the mat community, may help optimize net production and
   accretion of mats, even in oligotrophic waters.}},

Abstract = {{Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) affects mercury (Hg) redox
   reactions and anaerobic microbial methylation in the environment.
   Several studies have shown that DOM can enhance Hg methylation,
   especially under sulfidic conditions, whereas others show that DOM
   inhibits Hg methylation due to strong Hg DOM complexation. In this
   study, we investigated and compared the effects of DOM on Hg methylation
   by an iron reducing bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA and a sulfate
   reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132 under nonsulfidic
   conditions. The methylation experiment was performed with washed cells
   either in the absence or presence of DOM or glutathione, both of which
   form strong complexes with Hg via thiolfunctional groups. DOM was found
   to greatly inhibit Hg methylation by G. Sulfurreducens PCA but enhance
   Hg methylation by D. desulfuricans ND132 cells with increasing DOM
   concentration. These strain-dependent opposing effects of DOM were also
   observed with glutathione, suggesting that thiols in DOM likely played
   an essential role in affecting microbial Hg uptake and methylation.
   Additionally, DOM and glutathione greatly decreased Hg sorption by G.
   sulfurreducens PCA but showed little effect on D. desulfuricans ND132
   cells, demonstrating that ND132 has a higher affinity to sorb or take up
   Hg than the PCA strain. These observations indicate that DOM effects on
   Hg methylation are bacterial strain specific, depend on the DOM:Hg ratio
   or site-specific conditions, and may thus offer new insights into the
   role of DOM in methylmercury production in the environment.}},

Title = {{Production, degradation, and flux of dissolved organic matter in the
   subterranean estuary of a large tidal flat}},
Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{The distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved
   hydrolysable amino acids (THAA), and colored dissolved organic matter
   (CDOM) were studied in pore-water/groundwater samples (including seeping
   water) from a subterranean estuary (STE) of a large tidal flat in
   Hampyeong Bay, Korea, in July 2011. The relatively low alanine D/L
   ratios and high THAA concentrations in the pore-water closest to the
   sediment surface (0-10 cm) indicate the active production of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) from benthic algae, and the relatively low THAA
   concentrations and high D/L ratios in the subsurface pore-water (10-35
   cm) indicate a relatively large presence of bio-degraded DOM. In the
   deep pore-water (35-75 cm), relatively low D/L ratios, high DOC
   concentrations, and intense humic-like fluorescence were observed,
   suggesting a net accumulation of less-reactive DOC in this layer.
   Overall, this STE appears to have net DOM sources because the
   concentrations of DOC (60-1700 mu M) in the pore-water decreased toward
   the land, the surface, and the low-salinity waters. The concentrations
   of DOC in the seeping water (185 +/- 52 mu M) were higher than those in
   the overlying seawater (144 +/- 9 mu M), resulting in net DOC fluxes of
   2-5 x 10(9) g.C.yr(-1) through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)
   into Hampyeong Bay. The organic matter compositions in the seeping water
   indicated that SGD introduced DOM from both the surface and subsurface
   layers. Our results highlight that tidal flats are important sources for
   DOM, implying that SGD-driven DOM plays an important role in coastal
   carbon cycles and biogeochemistry. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Arctic surface microlayer}},
Journal = {{OCEAN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{401-418}},
Abstract = {{The surface microlayer (SML) represents a unique system of which the
   physicochemical characteristics may differ from those of the underlying
   subsurface seawater (SSW). Within the Arctic pack ice area, the SML has
   been characterized as enriched in small colloids of biological origin,
   resulting from extracellular polymeric secretions (EPS). During the
   Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) in August 2008, particulate
   organic matter (POM, with size range > 0.22 mu m) and dissolved organic
   matter (DOM, <0.22 mu m, obtained after filtration) samples were
   collected and chemically characterized from the SML and the
   corresponding SSW at an open lead centered at 87.5 degrees N and 5
   degrees E. Total organic carbon was persistently enriched in the SML
   with a mean enrichment factor (EF) of 1.45 +/- 0.41, whereas sporadic
   depletions of dissolved carbohydrates and amino acids were observed.
   Monosaccharide compositional analysis reveals that EPS in the Arctic
   lead was formed mainly of distinctive heteropolysaccharides, enriched in
   xylose, fucose and glucose. The mean concentrations of total
   hydrolysable neutral sugars in SSW were 94.9 +/- 37.5 nM in high
   molecular weight (HMW) DOM (> 5 kDa) and 64.4 +/- 14.5 nM in POM. The
   enrichment of polysaccharides in the SML appeared to be a common
   feature, with EFs ranging from 1.7 to 7.0 for particulate
   polysaccharides and 3.5 to 12.1 for polysaccharides in the HMW DOM
   fraction. A calculated monosaccharide yield suggests that polymers in
   the HMW DOM fraction were scavenged, without substantial degradation,
   into the SML. Bubble scavenging experiments showed that newly aggregated
   particles could be formed abiotically by coagulation of low molecular
   weight nanometer-sized gels. Aerosol particles, artificially generated
   by bubbling experiments, were enriched in polysaccharides by factors of
   22-70, relative to the source seawater. We propose that bubble
   scavenging of surface-active polysaccharides could be one of the
   possible mechanisms for the enrichment of polysaccharides in the high
   Arctic open lead SML.}},

Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1501-1521}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Despite the importance of CDOM to upper ocean biogeochemical processes
   and optics, our current understanding of its spatial and temporal
   distributions and the factors controlling these distributions is very
   limited. This eventually prevents an understanding of its relationship
   to the pool of dissolved organic carbon in coastal and open oceans. This
   work aims to present a new approach for accurate modeling of absorption
   spectra of CDOM (a(cdom)) and deriving information on its composition in
   global ocean waters. The modeling approach uses measurements (in situ)
   of the remote sensing reflectances at two wavelengths (denoted
   R-555(443)rs) to estimate a(cdom)(350) and a(cdom)(412), applies them to
   determine two spectral slopes of an exponential curve fit (S) and a
   hyperbolic curve fit (gamma), derives an appropriate parameter (gamma
   degrees) for grading the CDOM compositional changes from a(cdom) (350)
   and gamma, and finally employs a(cdom) (350), S. and gamma degrees in a
   modified exponential model to describe a(cdom)(lambda) as a function of
   wavelength. The robustness of this model was rigorously tested on three
   independent datasets, such as NOMAD in situ data, NOMAD SeaWiFS
   match-ups data and IOCCG simulated data (all of them contain
   a(cdom)(lambda) and R-rs(lambda)). which represent a variety of waters
   within coastal and offshore regions around the world. Accuracy of the
   retrievals found with the new models was generally excellent, with MRE
   (mean relative error) and RMSE (root mean square error) of -5.64-3.55\%
   and 0.203-0.318 for the NOMAD in situ datasets, and -5.63 to -0.98\% and
   0.136-0.241 for the NOMAD satellite datasets respectively (for
   lambda(412) to lambda(670)). When used with SeaWiFS images collected
   over the regional and global waters, the new model showed the highest
   surface abundances of CDOM within the subpolar gyres and continental
   shelves dominated by terrestrial inputs (and perhaps local production)
   of colored dissolved materials, and the lowest surface abundances of
   CDOM in the central subtropical gyres and the open oceans presumably
   regulated by photobleaching phenomenon, bacterial activity and local
   processes. Significant interseasonal and interannual seasonal changes in
   the terrestrially-derived CDOM distributions were noticed from these new
   products that closely corresponded with the global mean runoff/river
   discharge induced by climate change/warming scenarios. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We investigated photoredox transformations of oxygen, carbon, peroxides,
   and iron that accompany ``photodissolution{''} of suspended marine
   particulate organic carbon (POC), a sunlight-induced process that
   transfers POC to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. During 18- to
   24-hour photodissolution experiments with POC of varying composition,
   about 0.28 mol of O-2 was consumed per mole POC photodissolved. Mean
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production was 6\% of initial POC in
   suspended river delta sediments and 1\% in algal membrane detritus. The
   mean O-2 loss:DIC production ratio was -1.3:1 in sediment suspensions,
   which slightly exceeds the typical range reported for DOC. The O-2
   loss:DIC production ratio was -7.7:1 in suspensions of algal detritus,
   which implies significant oxygen incorporation into (oxygenation of)
   organic matter. Irradiated sediment suspensions rapidly achieved low,
   steady-state peroxide concentrations but rose more slowly with algal
   detritus. Elevated iron concentrations in the 0.7-8.0 mu m particle size
   fraction after 24 h of irradiation are consistent with photoredox
   cycling of metals and/or with physical disintegration of organic-mineral
   aggregates driven by organic matter dissolution. These oxidation and
   oxygenation results differ from analogous reactions previously found for
   marine DOC, and estimates of DIC production in particle-rich
   environments will require incorporation of POC-specific information. (C)

Journal = {{BIOGEOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{115-126}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A series of laboratory-based and field experiments was conducted to
   address the effects of sunlight-exposed resuspended sediments on
   dissolved nutrient fluxes in two different water bodies. In suspensions
   of tidal creek sediments in 0.2 mu m-filtered creek water, measurable
   increases in dissolved nutrients occurred after only 2 h of exposure to
   simulated sunlight. During a 6-h irradiation, nutrient release rates for
   total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and phosphate were 2.2 +/- A 0.5
   (standard error; S.E.) mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and 0.09 +/- A 0.005 mu mol
   g(-1) h(-1) (S.E.), compared to no significant changes in dark controls.
   The majority of nitrogen was released as dissolved organic nitrogen
   (87\% on average) with lesser amounts of ammonium (13\%). Continental
   shelf sediments resuspended in unfiltered seawater also released
   phosphate and TDN when exposed to sunlight, suggesting that this process
   can occur in a variety of marine and estuarine environments. The source
   material for inorganic nutrients appears to be associated with sediments
   rather than dissolved organic matter, as no significant changes in
   nutrient concentrations occurred in experiments with 0.2 mu m-filtered
   creek water or seawater alone. Results suggest that photoproduction of
   dissolved nutrients from resuspended sediments could be an episodically
   significant and previously unrecognized source of dissolved organic and
   inorganic nutrients to coastal ecosystems. This process may be
   especially important for continental margins where episodic resuspension
   events occur, as well as in regions experiencing high riverine sediment
   fluxes resulting from erosion associated with deforestation and
   desertification.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report on spatial and temporal changes in the concentration and
   composition of total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved
   lignin-phenols (sum 8) in surface and bottom waters in estuarine and
   inner shelf off the Louisiana coast (USA). DOC samples were collected at
   6 stations on 3 cruises (April 2008, July 2008) for organic analyses
   along a transect that spanned from inside Terrebonne-Timbalier Bay
   estuary, Louisiana (7 m water depth) to the outer-most station on the
   inner Louisiana shelf (18.5 m water depth). An additional set of samples
   was taken for DOC and dissolved lignin-phenols in April 2009 in the
   upper marshes of the estuary in water depths typically ca. 1 m.
   Hydrographic properties of shelf waters in April 2008 were drastically
   different than in July 2008 because of the higher river discharge from
   the Mississippi River (MR) and the opening of man-made water diversion
   structures in Louisiana in April. There were no significant differences
   in DOC concentrations between the inner bay and shelf stations, likely
   due to extensive mixing between the bay and shelf waters. However, there
   were significantly higher concentrations of dissolved lignin (sum 8) and
   Lambda(8) at the marsh stations ((x) over bar =0.28 +/- 0.15 mg L-1 and
   (x) over bar = 0.69 +/- 0.35), compared to the inner shelf ((x) over bar
   = 0.16 +/- 0.06 mg L-1 and (x) over bar = 0.24 +/- 0.12) stations.
   respectively. Low S/V and C/N ratios observed in Terrebonne-Timbalier
   Bay estuary were likely the result of selective degradation of syringyl
   and cinnamyl over vanillyl lignin-phenols, and not inputs of woody
   gymnosperms. A gradient of decreasing S/V ratios along a transect from
   the upper marshes to the shelf was likely the result of photochemical
   breakdown of lignin and dilution effects from marine waters near the
   outer reaches of the estuary. Inputs of photochemically-altered DOC from
   estuaries such as Terrebonne-Timbalier Bay to the inner Louisiana shelf
   may provide an additional source of OC for microbial food webs in the
   northern Gulf of Mexico. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Microalgal-based indicators were used to assess terrestrial influence on
   Shiraho coral reef of Ishigaki Island (Okinawa, Japan). A typhoon
   occurred on 4-5 August 2005 and sampling were made on three occasions
   thereafter (6, 8, and 11 August). Pre-typhoon sampling was conducted on
   26 July. The typhoon-enhanced terrestrial discharges increased reef
   nutrient levels (e.g. average NO3--N: 0.088 mg/L pretyphoon to 0.817
   mg/L post-typhoon). This elevated chlorophyll-a concentrations by four
   times and shifted phytoplankton composition (spectral class-based) from
   an initial dominance of diatoms and green microalgae to the dominance of
   bluegreen microalgae (cyanobacteria) and cryptophytes. Cyanobacteria
   later increased by more than 200\% and accounted for as much as 80\% of
   total chl-a (similar to 0.29 mu g/L), possibly assisted by favorable
   nutrient availability. In outer reef waters, diatoms and green
   microalgae predominated whereas cyanobacteria and cryptophytes were
   nearly undetectable. Due to detrital decomposition and river discharge,
   the CDOM was much higher in the inner reef than in the outer reef.
   Benthic bluegreen microalgae were relatively more abundant in areas
   close to the river mouth and coastal agricultural fields. At these
   locations, nutrient concentrations were much higher due to river
   discharge and potentially significant groundwater discharge. Thus,
   phytoplankton and benthic microalgae can serve as indicators of
   terrestrial influence on coral reefs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Influence of distribution and abundance of bacterial taxa on ecosystem
   function are poorly understood for natural microbial communities. We
   related 16S rRNA-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
   to bacterial production and arginine uptake kinetics to test if
   functional features of bacterioplankton in four lakes could be predicted
   from community composition. Maximum arginine uptake rate (arginine
   V-max) ranged from 10\% to 100\% of bacterial production. Owing to high
   growth efficiencies on arginine (63-77\%), the bacterial community could
   potentially saturate its carbon demand using this single organic
   substrate, for example, during sudden surges of free amino acids.
   However, due to low in situ concentrations of arginine in these lakes (<
   0.9 mu g l(-1)), actual uptake rates at ambient concentrations rarely
   exceeded 10\% of Vmax. Bacterial production and arginine Vmax could be
   predicted from a subset of bacterial ribotypes, tentatively affiliated
   with several bacterial divisions (Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria,
   Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria). Multivariate statistical analysis
   indicates that there were both highly important and less important
   ribotypes for the prediction of bacterial production and arginine Vmax.
   These populations were either negatively or positively related to the
   respective functional feature, indicating contrasting ecological roles.
   Our study provides a statistically robust demonstration that, apart from
   environmental conditions, patterns in bacterial community composition
   can also be used to predict lake ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{The transport and discharge of ship ballast water has been recognized as
   a major vector for the introduction of invasive species. Chemical
   oxidants, long used in drinking water and wastewater treatment, are
   alternative treatment methods for the control of invasive species
   currently being tested for use on ships. One concern when a ballasted
   vessel arrives in port is the adverse effects of residual oxidant in the
   treated water. The most common oxidants include chlorine (HOCl/OCl-),
   bromine (HOBr/OBr-), ozone (O-3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), chlorine
   dioxide (ClO2), and monochloramine (NH2Cl). The present study was
   undertaken to evaluate the sunlight-mediated photochemical decomposition
   of these oxidants. Sunlight photodecomposition was measured at various
   pH using either distilled water or oligotrophic Gulf Stream water for
   specific oxidants. For selected oxidants, quantum yields at specific
   wavelengths were obtained. An environmental photochemical model,
   GCSOLAR, also provided predictions of the fate (sunlight photolysis
   half-lives) of HOCl/OCl-, HOBr/OBr-, ClO2, and NH2Cl for two different
   seasons at latitude 40 degrees and in water with two different
   concentrations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter. These data are
   useful in assessing the environmental fate of ballast water treatment
   oxidants if they were to be discharged in port.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of underwater tight is a critical factor in the growth
   and abundance of primary producers in shallow embayments. The goal of
   this study was to examine the relative importance of factors influencing
   tight availability in this type of water body. Many simulation models of
   aquatic ecosystems predict tight attenuation from chlorophyll or
   phytoplankton stock. In the three southern New England sites studied
   here, no useful relationship was found to exist between chlorophyll and
   K-PAR (the diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active
   radiation; Kirk 1994; Mobley 1994). In 40 of 53 cases, a regression of
   chlorophyll versus K-PAR was not statisticatly significant. Variation in
   K-PAR did demonstrate a correlation to salinity, implicating a
   freshwater source of light attenuating material. This was true even in a
   system with little freshwater inflow. Colored dissolved organic matter
   (CDOM) is one such terrestrial input that enters estuaries from their
   watersheds and can strongly influence the availability of light to
   aquatic primary producers. This study demonstrated that over 70\% of the
   variability in the K-PAR coefficient can be attributed to CDOM in the
   shallow estuaries studied. This illustrates the need for improved model
   formulations that include CDOM in the prediction of light attenuation in
   shallow coastal systems. A new equation has been developed to predict
   K-PAR with CDOM.}},

Abstract = {{The fluorescence of dissolved organic matter has been measured on three
   cruises covering the Mid-Atlantic Bight in the spring of 1994 and 1996
   and the summer of 1996. An attempt at a ``mass{''} balance of
   fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) on the shelf suggests that
   more FDOM is present during the spring than during the summer and that
   deficits during the summer are due to photodegradation. However,
   subsurface production of FDOM was also prevalent during the summer.
   These processes were observed due to high shelf productivity and a
   stable water column that isolates a ``cold pool{''} below sunlit surface
   waters. Rivers contributed about 10\% of the total FDOM to the shelf
   with the majority of FDOM being advected onto the shelf from slope
   waters. Net production of FDOM was observed in the spring while net
   degradation of FDOM was observed in the summer. The fluorescence of
   dissolved organic matter appears to be a useful measurement for better
   understanding dissolved organic carbon dynamics as well as ocean optics
   in ocean margins. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The biological processes involved during mixing of a river plume with
   the marine underlying water were studied off the Rhone River outlet.
   Samples of suspended and dissolved matter were collected while tracking
   a drifting buoy. Three trajectories were performed, at 2-day intervals,
   under different hydrological and meteorological situations. A biological
   uptake was evidenced from ammonium (NH4) and phosphate (PO4) shortage,
   indicating an early ``NH4-dependent{''} functioning occurring before the
   well-known ``NO3-based{''} cycle. The different ratios between NH4, NO3
   and PO4, as a function of salinity, were discussed to detail the
   preferential use in PO3 and NH4. Salinity zones with enhanced bacterial
   production, high chlorophyll a concentration, as well as DOG, NH4 and
   PO4 consumption were evidenced from 20 to 35 in salinity. It was shown
   that the successive abundance of bacteria and phytoplankton during
   transfer reflected the competition for PO3 of both communities. On the
   Rhone River plume, the role played by temperature, light conditions and
   suspended matter upon biological activity seems relatively minor
   compared to salinity distribution and its related parameter: nutrient
   availability. It can be concluded that biological uptake in the Rhone
   River plume was closely related to the dilution mechanism, controlled
   itself by the dynamics of the plume. In windless conditions and close to
   the river mouth, the density gradient between marine and river water
   induced limited exchanges between the nutrient-rich freshwater and the
   potential consumers in the underlying marine water. Consequently, Little
   biological activity is observed close to the river mouth. Offshore,
   mixing is enhanced and a balance is reached between salinity tolerance
   and nutrient availability to form a favourable zone for marine
   phytoplankton development. This can be quite far from the river mouth in
   case of a widely spread plume, corresponding to high river discharge.
   Under windy and wavy conditions, the plume freshwater is early and
   rapidly mixed, so that the extension of the ``enhanced production
   zone{''} is drastically reduced and even bacteria could not benefit from
   the fast mixing regime induced. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The sorptive properties of pore water organic matter and organic matter
   easily extracted from marine sediments were examined in a series of
   batch adsorption and desorption experiments. Pore water natural organic
   matter (pNOM) and easily extracted natural organic matter (eNOM) were
   isolated from Sinclair Inlet, WA (USA) sediments. The NOM fractions were
   concentrated similar to 9 times via rotoevaporation and then sorbed to,
   and desorbed from, organic-free sediment, sediment size fractions
   (63-250, 38-63 and < 38 mu m), montmorillonite and iron oxide. Sorption
   isotherms of pNOM varied little with changing sediment grain size or
   mineralogy, and Freundlich linearity coefficients (n) were all near 1
   (range 0.65-1.15). eNOM was more heterogeneous in its sorption to the
   various surfaces, having a wider range of linearity coefficients
   (0.38-1.36) and a greater tendency to sorb to the montmorillonite.
   Average partition coefficients (K(d)) for the pNOM and eNOM were small
   (0.1 +/- 0.04 and 0.08 +/- 0.03 l g(-1)), illustrating only a low
   affinity for the surfaces. Hystereses observed in the desorption
   isotherms relative to the adsorption isotherms extrapolate back to the
   origin, suggesting that the sorption of NOM was reversible. A
   multiple-component model fit to the sorption and desorption data
   suggests that both the pNOM and eNOM fractions can be described as
   similar to 1:2 mixtures of two components with average K(d)'s of 3.2 and
   0.02 l g(-1), respectively. This result was confirmed in a cumulative
   adsorption experiment, where less than 40\% of the pNOM was found to be
   surface-reactive. The overall similarity of the sorptive properties of
   pNOM and eNOM suggest that the two isolates are subgroups of a single
   sedimentary NOM pool. At natural sediment porosities between 0.5 and
   0.95, pNOM is buffered by a surface-bound eNOM pool that is many times
   larger than the pNOM pool with which it is undergoing exchange. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Lipid classes (Iatroscan TLC/FID method) and fatty acids (GC/MS) of
   settling particles and dissolved fraction were investigated in the north
   Adriatic sea in June 1995. The differences in composition and
   concentrations were examined according to distance from Isonzo river
   Estuary, depth and fraction (particulate versus dissolved). Total
   particulate lipids showed large variations, from 32.6 to 139.5 mu g/l.
   The highest concentration was observed as for POC and total individual
   fatty acids in surface waters close to the river mouth. The ratio
   particulate lipids,POC ranged from 0.14 to 0.40 (average 0.27), which
   expressed different biosynthetic pathways by planktonic communities, as
   previously shown when nitrogen limitation can favor a switch from
   protein to lipid metabolism. The highest value was found in surface
   waters in the central part of the Gulf of Trieste, suggesting the
   existence of different stress conditions such as nutrient limitation,
   from those existing near the Isonzo river mouth. Total dissolved lipids
   did not show large variations (49-88 mu g/l). The ratio dissolved
   lipids/DOC also varied in a narrow range (0.03-0.04), bur with much
   lower values than those found in the particulate fraction. The
   comparison between particulate and dissolved lipid classes and fatty
   acids indicated a decoupling between the two reservoirs. Inputs from
   living organisms and freshly synthesized organic matter were clearly
   revealed in the dissolved fraction by phospholipids and polyunsaturated
   fatty acids. Degradation indicators such as free fatty acids and
   monoacylglycerols were significantly more represented in the particulate
   fraction than in the dissolved one near the river mouth, whereas the
   contrary was observed in the central part of the Gulf. Complementary
   informations were obtained from fatty acid distribution patterns such as
   for terrestrial originating inputs using the long-chain series. The
   importance of bacteria was observed using branched fatty acids and 18:1
   omega 7. The two bacterial signatures were found in both fractions, with
   highest imprints near the river mouth. Some enrichment of the branched
   fatty acids in the dissolved fraction in the central part of the Gulf
   could be related with the high contribution of polar lipids, suggesting
   a marked contribution of bacteria to the polar lipid fraction. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The dynamics of N and its interactions with labile dissolved organic C
   (DOC), bacteria, and phytoplankton were studied to determine potential
   effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and light on N dynamics in
   surface waters of the Mississippi River (USA) plume in the Gulf of
   Mexico. Bacterial uptake of added labeled N compounds ((NH4+)-N-15 or
   N-15-labeled dissolved free amino acids, DFAA) was stimulated more by
   high-molecular-weight (HMW, >1 kDa) DOM than by low-molecular-weight
   (LMW, <1 kDa) DOM. An index that inversely indicated the presence of
   labile DOC was defined as the fraction of assimilated Amino acid-N-15
   that was Recovered as N-15-Ammonium (ANRA), following the additions of
   high-levels (4 mu M) of N-15-DFAA. ANRA ratios were high in the absence
   of other available carbon sources because heterotrophic bacteria were
   forced to use the added amino acids as a carbon source for respiration
   rather than as a nutrient source for biomass formation. In dynamic
   light/dark experiments, conducted with in situ populations of organisms,
   uptake rates of added (NH4+)-N-15 were significantly enhanced both by
   the presence of light and by the addition of HMW DOM. Uptake rates of
   added N-15-labeled DFAA were increased by the addition of HMW DOM but
   not by light. ANRA ratios were consistently lower in the presence of
   added HMW DOM than in controls. Added HMW DOM thus appeared to stimulate
   the incorporation of assimilated DFAA into bacterial biomass. Bacterial
   growth rates were relatively high in both light and dark bottles with
   DFAA additions and in light bottles with HMW DOM plus NH4+ additions,
   but they remained comparatively low in dark bottles with added NH4+.
   These results are consistent with the idea that bacterial N dynamics in
   these euphotic waters may be tightly coupled to photosynthetic
   activities over short time scales.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen consumption and production and carbon fixation by micro-organisms

   between the oxygen and carbon measurements, total daily water-column
   integrated carbon incorporation measured by radiocarbon uptake in the
   particulate fraction underestimated net community production measured by
   the oxygen method by 29 to 54 \% (using a photosynthetic quotient of
   1.5). Unaccounted-for exudation of dissolved organic carbon during the
   C-14 uptake experiments may explain this discrepancy. Respiratory carbon
   losses by micro-organisms (largely phytoplankton) ranged between 10 and
   50\% of gross production, the highest values corresponding to the more
   productive stations. These estimates are, however, slightly
   conservative, since they refer to the upper 30 m of the water column,
   corresponding approximately to the euphotic zone in this region. Our
   results show that microbial respiration is an important part of the
   carbon flux of coastal. Antarctic plankton. Unless it is considered in
   carbon flux models, the contribution of higher trophic levels to the
   carbon fluxes in marine food webs may be seriously overestimated.}},

Abstract = {{A discrepancy exists between the low concentrations of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) in seawater measured by `standard' techniques, such as
   wet-chemical oxidation, UV photo-oxidation, and dry high-temperature
   combustion, and the relatively high concentrations measured using new
   catalyzed, high-temperature combustion methods. One of the factors that
   could help explain this discrepancy is the nature of the DOC being
   analyzed. Because little is known about the structure of the bulk of
   DOC, here we will discuss DOC sources, how sources could affect
   structure, and how structure as well as chemical factors and sampling
   procedures might affect analysis of DOC. One likely reason for the
   discrepancy between the standard and new methods is the presence of a
   fraction of DOC not previously measured by the standard techniques. This
   `new' DOC could consist of refractory, large, highly cross-linked
   macromolecular organic material, possibly colloidal in nature. Material
   that incorporates sulfur or specific organic structures which inhibit
   wet-chemical oxidation or photo-oxidation could also be present. Other
   possible materials present that might explain the discrepancy are those
   that are prone to incomplete oxidation because they form unreactive
   compounds during standard oxidation procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Sea ice contains a large amount of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which
   can be released into the ocean once it melts. In this study, Arctic sea
   ice DOM was characterized for its optical (fluorescence) properties as
   well as the molecular sizes and composition via size exclusion
   chromatography and Fourier transformation ion cyclotron resonance mass
   spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Ice cores were collected along with the
   underlying seawater samples in Cambridge Bay, an Arctic area
   experiencing seasonal ice formation. The ice core samples revealed a
   marked enrichment of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compared to the
   seawater counterparts (up to 6.2 times greater). The accumulation can be
   attributed to in situ production by the autotrophic and heterotrophic
   communities. Fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEMs) elaborated
   with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) evidenced the prevalence of
   protein-like substances in the ice cores, which likely results from in
   situ production followed by accumulation in the ice. Size exclusion
   chromatography further revealed the in situ production of all DOM size
   fractions, with the exception of the humic substance fraction. The
   majority of DOM in both the ice and seawater consists of
   lowmolecularweight compounds (<350 Da) probably derived by the microbial
   degradation/transformation of freshly produced DOM. Molecular
   characterization also supported the in situ production of DOM and
   highlighted the marked difference in molecular composition between sea
   ice and seawater. This study provides new insights into the possible
   role of sea ice DOM in the Arctic carbon cycle under climate change. (C)

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{187-194}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is ubiquitous and plays an important role
   in regulating water quality, ecological function, and the fate and
   transport of trace elements and pollutants in aquatic environments. Both
   the colloidal precursors (i.e. <1 kDa) and bulk DOM collected from a
   freshwater estuary were incubated in the dark for 21 days to examine
   dynamic changes in molecular size and composition induced by microbial
   degradation and self-assembly. Results showed that the concentrations of
   total organic carbon, carbohydrates, and protein-like substances
   decreased by 11-30\% during incubation, while those of humic- and
   fulvic-like substances remained relatively constant, indicating humic
   substances are more resistant to microbial utilization compared to
   carbohydrates and protein-like DOM. Despite the different extents in
   decline, these DOM components had a similar transformation pathway from
   the <1 kDa to colloids (1 kDa-0.45 Am) and further to microparticles
   (>0.45 mu m). Overall, carbohydrates and protein-like substances,
   especially the high molecular weight components, were preferentially
   decomposed by microorganisms whereas humic- and fulvic-like DOM
   components significantly coagulated through abiotic self-assembly. The
   contrasting degradation/transformation pathways between the humic-like
   and protein-like substances along the size continuum, as also
   characterized by flow field-flow fractionation analysis, demonstrated
   that the dynamic transformation and degradation of DOM is regulated by
   both molecular size and organic composition. This finding provides new
   insights into the biogeochemical cycling pathways of heterogeneous DOM
   and its environmental fate and ecological role in aquatic systems. (C)

Title = {{Production of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in Arctic Ocean
   sediments}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about the production of fluorescent dissolved organic
   matter (FDOM) in the anoxic oceanic sediments. In this study, sediment
   pore waters were sampled from four different sites in the Chukchi-East
   Siberian Seas area to examine the bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   and their optical properties. The production of FDOM, coupled with the
   increase of nutrients, was observed above the
   sulfate-methane-transition-zone (SMTZ). The presence of FDOM was
   concurrent with sulfate reduction and increased alkalinity (R-2 > 0.96,
   p < 0.0001), suggesting a link to organic matter degradation. This
   inference was supported by the positive correlation (R-2 > 0.95, p <
   0.0001) between the net production of FDOM and the modeled degradation
   rates of particulate organic carbon sulfate reduction. The production of
   FDOM was more pronounced in a shallow shelf site S1 with a total net
   production ranging from 17.9 to 62.3 RU for different FDOM components
   above the SMTZ depth of ca. 4.1 mbsf, which presumably underwent more
   accumulation of particulate organic matter than the other three deeper
   sites. The sediments were generally found to be the sources of CDOM and
   FDOM to the overlying water column, unearthing a channel of generally
   bio-refractory and pre-aged DOM to the oceans.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first decadal reanalysis simulation of the
   biogeochemistry of the North West European shelf, along with a full
   evaluation of its skill, confidence, and value. An error-characterized
   satellite product for chlorophyll was assimilated into a
   physical-biogeochemical model of the North East Atlantic, applying a
   localized Ensemble Kalman filter. The results showed that the reanalysis
   improved the model simulation of assimilated chlorophyll in 60\% of the
   study region. Model validation metrics showed that the reanalysis had
   skill in matching a large data set of in situ observations for 10
   ecosystem variables. Spearman rank correlations were significant and
   higher than 0.7 for physical-chemical variables (temperature, salinity,
   and oxygen), similar to 0.6 for chlorophyll and nutrients (phosphate,
   nitrate, and silicate), and significant, though lower in value, for
   partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide (similar to 0.4). The
   reanalysis captured the magnitude of pH and ammonia observations, but
   not their variability. The value of the reanalysis for assessing
   environmental status and variability has been exemplified in two case
   studies. The first shows that between 325,000 and 365,000 km(2) of shelf
   bottom waters were vulnerable to oxygen deficiency potentially
   threatening bottom fishes and benthos. The second application confirmed
   that the shelf is a net sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide, but the
   total amount of uptake varies between 36 and 46 Tg C yr(-1) at a 90\%
   confidence level. These results indicate that the reanalysis output data
   set can inform the management of the North West European shelf
   ecosystem, in relation to eutrophication, fishery, and variability of
   the carbon cycle.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an assemblage of reduced
   carbon compounds, which results from biotic and abiotic processes. The
   biotic processes consist in either release or uptake of specific
   molecules by marine organisms. Heterotrophic bacteria have been mostly
   considered to influence the DOM composition by preferential uptake of
   certain compounds. However, they also secrete a variety of molecules
   depending on physiological state, environmental and growth conditions,
   but so far the full set of compounds secreted by these bacteria has
   never been investigated. In this study, we analyzed the exo-metabolome,
   metabolites secreted into the environment, of the heterotrophic marine
   bacterium Pseudovibrio sp. FO-BEG1 via ultra-high resolution mass
   spectrometry, comparing phosphate limited with phosphate surplus growth
   conditions. Bacteria belonging to the Pseudovibrio genus have been
   isolated worldwide, mainly from marine invertebrates and were described
   as metabolically versatile Alphaproteobacteria. We show that the
   exo-metabolome is unexpectedly large and diverse, consisting of hundreds
   of compounds that differ by their molecular formulae. It is
   characterized by a dynamic recycling of molecules, and it is drastically
   affected by the physiological state of the strain. Moreover, we show
   that phosphate limitation greatly influences both the amount and the
   composition of the secreted molecules. By assigning the detected masses
   to general chemical categories, we observed that under phosphate surplus
   conditions the secreted molecules were mainly peptides and highly
   unsaturated compounds. In contrast, under phosphate limitation the
   composition of the exo-metabolome changed during bacterial growth,
   showing an increase in highly unsaturated, phenolic, and polyphenolic
   compounds. Finally, we annotated the detected masses using multiple
   metabolite databases. These analyses suggested the presence of several
   masses analogue to masses of known bioactive compounds. However, the
   annotation was successful only for a minor part of the detected
   molecules, underlining the current gap in knowledge concerning the
   biosynthetic ability of marine heterotrophic bacteria.}},

Title = {{Uncoupling of Bacterial and Terrigenous Dissolved Organic Matter
   Dynamics in Decomposition Experiments}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{The biodegradability of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (tDOM)
   exported to the sea has a major impact on the global carbon cycle, but
   our understanding of tDOM bioavailability is fragmentary. In this study,
   the effects of preparative tDOM isolation on microbial decomposition
   were investigated in incubation experiments consisting of mesocosms
   containing mesohaline water from the Baltic Sea. Dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) consumption, molecular DOM composition, bacterial
   activities, and shifts in bacterial community structure were compared
   between mesocosms supplemented with riverine tDOM, either as filtered,
   particle-free river water or as a concentrate obtained by
   lyophilization/tangential ultrafiltration, and those containing only
   Baltic Sea water or river water. As shown using ultra-high-resolution
   mass spectrometry (15 Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance
   mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS) covering approximately 4600 different DOM
   compounds, the three DOM preparation protocols resulted in distinct
   patterns of molecular DOM composition. However, despite DOC losses of
   4-16\% and considerable bacterial production, there was no significant
   change in DOM composition during the 28-day experiment. Moreover, tDOM
   addition affected neither DOC degradation nor bacterial dynamics
   significantly, regardless of the tDOM preparation. This result suggested
   that the introduced tDOM was largely not bioavailable, at least on the
   temporal scale of our experiment, and that the observed bacterial
   activity and DOC decomposition mainly reflected the degradation of
   unknown, labile, colloidal and low-molecular weight DOM, both of which
   escape the analytical window of FT-ICR-MS. In contrast to the different
   tDOM preparations, the initial bacterial inoculum and batch culture
   conditions determined bacterial community succession and superseded the
   effects of tDOM addition. The uncoupling of tDOM and bacterial dynamics
   suggests that mesohaline bacterial communities cannot efficiently
   utilize tDOM and that in subarctic estuaries other factors are
   responsible for the removal of imported tDOM.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled physical-biogeochemical model (BALTSEM) is used to estimate
   carbon fluxes in the Baltic Sea over the 1980-2006 period. Budget
   calculations for organic carbon indicate that of the total allochthonous
   organic carbon (TOCT) supplied to the system, on average 56\% is
   mineralized, 36\% is exported out of the system, and the remainder is
   buried. River discharge is the main source of dissolved inorganic carbon
   (DIC) to the Baltic Sea. However, model results indicate that in the
   Gulf of Bothnia (northern Baltic Sea), the contribution to the DIC stock
   by TOCT mineralization is of the same order as direct river input of DIC
   In the Kattegat and Danish Straits (southwestern Baltic Sea) on the
   other hand, net uptake of atmospheric CO2 comprises the major DIC
   source. Despite large variations within the system, with net outgassing
   from some sub-basins and net absorption in others, the Baltic Sea as a
   whole was estimated to be a net sink for atmospheric CO2. Mineralization
   of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOCT) influences air-sea CO2
   exchange. A sensitivity study indicates that depending on the labile
   fraction of DOCT, the contribution from CO2 absorption to total external
   DIC sources can amount to 10-25\%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A stable isotope (C-13)-labeling experiment was performed to quantify
   the importance of bacterial carbon as a food source for an Arctic
   deep-sea nematode community. Bacterial functional groups were
   isotopically enriched with C-13-glucose, C-13-acetate, C-13-bicarbonate,
   and C-13-amino acids injected into sediments collected from 1280 m depth
   at 79 degrees N, 6 degrees E, west of Svalbard. Incorporation of the
   C-13 label into bacterial phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFAs) and
   nematodes in the top 5 cm of the sediment was monitored over a 7-d
   period. The C-13 dynamics of nematodes was fitted with a simple isotope
   turnover model to derive the importance of the different bacterial
   functional groups as carbon sources for the nematodes. The different
   substrates clearly labeled different bacterial groups as evidenced by
   differential labeling of the PLFA patterns. The deep-sea nematode
   community incorporated a very limited amount of the label, and the
   isotope turnover model showed that the dynamics of the isotope transfer
   could not be attributed to bacterivory. The low enrichment of nematodes
   suggests a limited passive uptake of injected C-13-labeled substrates.
   The lack of accumulation suggests that the injected C-13-labeled
   dissolved organic carbon compounds are not important as carbon sources
   for deep-sea nematodes. Since earlier studies with isotopically enriched
   algae also found limited uptake by nematodes, the food sources of
   deep-sea nematodes remain unclear.}},

Abstract = {{We used a new experimental device called PASS (PArticle Sinking
   Simulator) during MedFlux to simulate changes in in situ hydrostatic
   pressure that particles experience sinking from mesopelagic to
   bathypelagic depths. Particles, largely fecal pellets, were collected at
   200m using a settling velocity NetTrap (SV NetTrap) in Ligurian Sea in
   April 2006 and incubated in high-pressure bottles (HPBs) of the PASS
   system under both atmospheric and continuously increasing pressure
   conditions, simulating the pressure change experienced at a sinking rate
   of 200 m d(-1). Chemical changes over time were evaluated by measuring
   particulate organic carbon (POC), carbohydrates, transparent exopolymer
   particles (TEP), amino acids, lipids, and chloropigments, as well as
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved carbohydrates. Microbial
   changes were evaluated microscopically, using diamidinophenylindole
   (DAPI) stain for total cell counts and catalyzed reporter
   deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) for
   phylogenetic distinctions. Concentrations (normalized to POC) of
   particulate chloropigments, carbohydrates and TEP decreased under both
   sets of incubation conditions, although less under the increasing
   pressure regime than under atmospheric conditions. By contrast,
   dissolved carbohydrates (normalized to DOC) were higher after incubation
   and significantly higher under atmospheric conditions, suggesting they
   were produced at the expense of the particulate fraction. POC-normalized
   particulate wax/steryl esters increased only under pressure, suggesting
   biochemical responses of prokaryotes to the increasing pressure regime.
   The prokaryotic community initially consisted of 43\% Bacteria, 12\%
   Crenarchaea and 11\% Euryarchaea. After incubation, Bacteria dominated
   (similar to 90\%) the prokaryote Community in all cases, with
   gamma-Proteobacteria comprising the greatest fraction, followed by the
   Cytophaga-Flavobacter cluster and alpha-Proteobacteria group. Using the
   PASS system, we obtained chemical and microbial evidence that
   degradation by prokaryotes associated with fecal pellets sinking through
   mesopelagic waters is limited by the increasing pressure they
   experience. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the effect of photochemical alterations of chromophoric
   dissolved organic matter (CDOM) on bacterial abundance, activity and
   community composition in a coastal lagoon of the Atlantic Ocean with
   high dissolved organic carbon concentration. On two occasions during the
   austral summer, bacteria-free water of the lagoon was exposed to
   different regions of the solar spectrum (full solar radiation, UV-A +
   PAR, PAR) or kept in the dark. Subsequently, dilution cultures were
   established with bacterioplankton from the lagoon that were incubated in
   the pre-exposed water for 5 h in the dark. Cell abundance, activity, and
   community composition of bacterioplankton were assessed before and after
   incubation in the different treatments. Changes in absorption,
   fluorescence, and DOC concentration were used as proxies for CDOM
   photoalteration. We found a significant CDOM photobleaching signal, DOC
   loss, as well as a stimulation of bacterial activity in the treatments
   pre-exposed to UV radiation, suggesting increased bioavailability of
   DOM. Bacterial community analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization
   revealed that this stimulation was mainly accompanied by the specific
   enrichment of Alpha-and Betaproteobacteria. Thus, our results suggest
   that CDOM photoalteration not only stimulates bacterioplankton growth,
   but also induces rapid changes in bacterioplankton composition, which
   can be of relevance for ecosystem functioning, particularly considering
   present and future changes in the input of terrestrial CDOM to aquatic
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Three models describing dissolved organic matter (DOM) flux and
   phytoplankton death, each of different levels of complexity, were
   constructed and tested against experimental data for a cyanobacterium, a
   chlorophyte, two diatoms, two dinoflagellates, and two prymnesiophytes.
   The simplest model described only bulk carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) forms
   of DOM (DOMC and DOMN) and employed a fixed relationship between
   phytoplankton nutrient status and DOM release and death rate. The most
   complex model described fractions of DOM as low molecular weight
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC; saccharides, low molecular weight
   carbohydrates {[}DOCs]), low molecular weight nitrogenous material
   (comprising C and N as DOC associated with low molecular weight
   compounds containing amino acids and/or nucleic acids {[}DOCa] and N
   associated with DOCa {[}DONa], which included dissolved free amino acids
   {[}DFAA]), and more complex materials (DOC associated with high
   molecular weight compounds typically requiring extracellular degradation
   prior to uptake or use by microbes {[}DOCx] and N associated with DOCx
   {[}DONx]). It also employed descriptions of DOM flux and cell death
   related to nutrient status and growth rates. In all instances, material
   lysed from dead cells contributed to the DOM pool. All three models
   captured the gross dynamics of the primary data (dissolved inorganic C
   {[}DIC], dissolved inorganic N {[}DIN], particulate organic carbon
   {[}POC], particulate organic N {[}PON], DOC, dissolved organic N
   {[}DON]), but there was little or no improvement of the fit with
   increasing model complexity. However, the simplest models tended to
   employ excessively high growth rates to compensate for high fixed death
   rates. While the proportion of newly fixed C being liberated as DOMC
   (DOCs plus DOCa) increased as nutrient status declined, the actual rate
   of release typically did not do so and often declined. The most complex
   model gave predictions for changes in released saccharides and DFAA in
   keeping with expectations. The major obstacle to future progress is the
   lack of suitable, mass balanced data sets for further model testing.}},

Abstract = {{The uptake of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was studied in four

   Headspace sampling was used to verify that the freely dissolved

   allowed sorption to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to be quantified for
   all but the most lipophilic PCB congeners. Equilibration with the
   dissolved phase was rapid for three of the four algae species (< 1 d for
   the majority of congeners). Organic carbon-normalized algae/water
   partition coefficients (K-AlgW) were similar for three of the four
   species, but were lower by a factor of 10 to 20 for Phaeodactylum
   tricornutum. The K-AlgW values of the first three species were similar
   to the octanol/water partition coefficient (K-OW) for those PCB
   congeners for which DOC sorption could be quantified. These K-AlgW

Abstract = {{The effects of size and origin of natural dissolved organic matter
   compounds (DOM) on the redox cycling of iron were investigated in water
   samples from a marine system (Strait of Gibraltar), from a freshwater
   system (Lake of Murten, i.e., Murtensee, Switzerland), and from a
   ``river-to-ocean{''} system (Rivers Scheldt and Rhine and corresponding
   estuaries). In the irradiated seawater samples, Fe(II) steady-state
   concentrations ({[}Fe(II)](ss)), both as percentage of total dissolved
   iron and normalized to 1 mg C L-1, were higher in the
   low-molecular-weight (LMW) than in the high-molecular-weight (HMW) DOM
   fractions, despite higher net rates of H2O2 formation in the HMW DOM
   fractions. Also in the samples from Murtensee, {[}Fe(II)](ss), both as
   percentage of total dissolved iron and normalized to the decadic
   absorption coefficient at 350 nm (alpha(350), unit m(-1)), were higher
   in the LMW than in the HMW DOM fractions. Unlike in the seawater
   samples, however, net rates of H2O2 production, normalized to
   alpha(350), were higher in the LMW DOM fractions, as compared to the HMW
   DOM fractions, indicating a higher efficiency of O-2(center dot-)
   formation with these LMW compounds from Murtensee. Based on the
   simulation of experimental data with mathematical kinetic modeling, we
   hypothesize that Fe(II) is formed through photolysis of Fe(III)
   complexes in the LMW DOM fractions from the Strait of Gibraltar and from
   Murtensee and that Fe(II) is stabilized by a ligand in the water samples
   from Murtensee. In the irradiated HMW DOM fractions from the
   ``river-to-ocean{''} system, {[}Fe(II)](ss), normalized to alpha(350),
   were generally higher in the water samples from the Rivers Scheldt and
   Rhine than in the water samples from their estuaries, suggesting that
   terrestrially derived DOM has a higher photochemical reactivity towards
   Fe(II) formation than autochthonous DOM.}},

Abstract = {{We present inorganic carbon data from the coastal upwelling region west
   of Vancouver Island, Canada (similar to48.5degreesN, 126degreesW)
   directly after an upwelling event and during summer downwelling in July
   1998. The inner-shelf buoyancy current, the outer-shelf and the slope
   regions are contrasted for both wind regimes (up- and downwelling).
   Results show strong biological drawdown of the partial pressure of
   carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) in response to upwelling over the outer-shelf.
   In contrast, measured pCO(2) is exceptionally high (pCO(2) > 1000 ppm)
   in the inner-shelf current, where biological uptake of carbon is
   consistently large. The biological C:N uptake ratio appears to increase
   when nitrogen becomes limiting (during downwelling), while the POC:PON
   ratio is relatively constant (slightly lower than the Redfield ratio)
   suggesting that excess carbon uptake does not go into the POC pool. As
   expected, large cells dominate where measured primary productivity is
   greatest. Sub-surface inorganic carbon (and pCO(2)) is high over the
   shelf. We suggest that carbon concentrations may be higher in coastal
   waters because of remineralization associated with high productivity
   that is confined to a smaller volume of water by bathymetry. At the
   coast these sub-surface concentrations are more efficiently mixed into
   the surface (especially during winter) relative to deeper offshore
   regions. Thus, despite high primary production, coastal waters may not
   aid in sequestration of atmospheric carbon. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The global ocean to atmosphere flux of carbon monoxide (CO) is simulated
   with 4.5 degrees X 7.5 degrees latitude-longitude spatial resolution
   using global data fields derived from an atmospheric general circulation
   model. The cloud and radiation package in the National Center for
   Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model is used to estimate the
   solar energy at the Earth's surface. This quantity is empirically
   related to photochemical interaction with dissolved organic matter, and
   the global concentration field of CO in surface seawater is estimated.
   Areas associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone and mid-to
   high-latitude winter hemisphere regions have relatively low
   climatological CO surface ocean concentrations on a local scale. The
   global surface wind and temperature fields are simultaneously used to
   calculate the global transfer velocity field of CO. Coupling these two
   computed fields, a global ocean to atmosphere CO flux of 165 +/- 80 Tg
   yr(-1) is proposed. The CO flux rates vary globally from 0.1 to 12 ug
   cm(-2) month(-1). The fluxes are largest in the mid-latitude summer
   hemispheres, with a maximum at 40 degrees S during the austral summer
   that is 40\% larger on a zonal average than at any northern hemisphere
   latitude. Relatively small continental sources of CO to the southern
   hemisphere atmosphere and the short atmospheric residence time of this
   trace gas indicate that ocean-derived CO may influence the local
   photochemical dynamics in the remote marine boundary layer of this
   region. A possible climate feedback scenario involving UV radiation,
   ozone, OH, and the air-sea exchange of CO is proposed. The global ocean
   to atmosphere CO flux proposed here is at the high end of those used in
   previous atmospheric CO budgets. This estimate however must be
   considered a lower limit because no explicit simulation of global
   oceanic primary productivity is presently in the model.}},

Title = {{Formation of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter by Bacterial
   Degradation of Phytoplankton-Derived Aggregates}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{Organic matter produced and released by phytoplankton during growth is
   processed by heterotrophic bacterial communities that transform
   dissolved organic matter into biomass and recycle inorganic nutrients,
   fueling microbial food web interactions. Bacterial transformation of
   phytoplankton-derived organic matter also plays a poorly known role in
   the formation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) which is
   ubiquitous in the ocean. Despite the importance of organic matter
   cycling, growth of phytoplankton and activities of heterotrophic
   bacterial communities are rarely measured in concert. To investigate
   CDOM formation mediated by microbial processing of phytoplankton-derived
   aggregates, we conducted growth experiments with non-axenic monocultures
   of three diatoms (Skeletonema grethae, Leptocylindrus hargravesii,
   Coscinodiscus sp.) and one haptophyte (Phaeocystis globose).
   Phytoplankton biomass, carbon concentrations, CDOM and base-extracted
   particulate organic matter (BEPOM) fluorescence, along with bacterial
   abundance and hydrolytic enzyme activities (alpha-glucosidase,
   beta-glucosidase, leucine-aminopeptidase) were measured during
   exponential growth and stationary phase (similar to 3-6 weeks) and
   following 6 weeks of degradation. Incubations were performed in rotating
   glass bottles to keep cells suspended, promoting cell coagulation and,
   thus, formation of macroscopic aggregates (marine snow), more similar to
   surface ocean processes. Maximum carbon concentrations, enzyme
   activities, and BEPOM fluorescence occurred during stationary phase. Net
   DOC concentrations (0.19-0.46 mg C L-1) increased on the same order as
   open ocean concentrations. CDOM fluorescence was dominated by
   protein-like signals that increased throughout growth and degradation
   becoming increasingly humic-like, implying the production of more

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in marine sediment pore waters derives
   largely from decomposition of particulate organic matter and its
   composition is influenced by various biogeochemical and oceanographic
   processes in yet undetermined ways. Here, we determine the molecular
   inventory of pore water DOM in marine sediments of contrasting
   depositional regimes with ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and
   complementary bulk chemical analyses in order to elucidate the factors
   that shape DOM composition. Our sample sets from the Mediterranean,
   Marmara and Black Seas covered different sediment depths, ages and a
   range of marine environments with different (i) organic matter sources,
   (ii) balances of organic matter production and preservation, and (iii)
   geochemical conditions in sediment and water column including anoxic,
   sulfidic and hypersaline conditions. Pore water DOM had a higher
   molecular formula richness than overlying water with up to 11,295 vs.
   2114 different molecular formulas in the mass range of 299-600 Da and
   covered a broader range of element ratios (H/C = 0.35-2.19, O/C =
   0.03-1.19 vs. H/C = 0.56-2.13, O/C = 0.15-1.14). Formula richness was
   independent of concentrations of DOC and TOC. Near-surface pore water
   DOM was more similar to water column DOM than to deep pore water DOM
   from the same core with respect to formula richness and the molecular
   composition, suggesting exchange at the sediment-water interface. The
   DOM composition in the deeper sediments was controlled by organic matter
   source, selective decomposition of specific DOM fractionsand early
   diagenetic molecule transformations. Compounds in pelagic sediment pore
   waters were predominantly highly unsaturated and N-bearing formulas,
   whereas oxygen-rich CHO-formulas and aromatic compounds were more
   abundant in pore water DOM from terrigenous sediments. The increase of
   S-bearing molecular formulas in the water column and pore waters of the
   Black Sea and the Mediterranean Discovery Basin was consistent with
   elevated HS-concentrations reflecting the incorporation of sulfur into
   biomolecules during early diagenesis. Sulfurization resulted in an
   increased average molecular mass of DOM and higher formula richness (up
   to 5899 formulas per sample). In sediments from the methanogenic zone in
   the Black Sea, the DOM pool was distinctly more reduced than overlying
   sediments from the sulfate-reducing zone. Bottom and pore water DOM from
   the Discovery Basin contained the highest abundances of aliphatic
   compounds in the entire dataset; a large fraction of abundant N-bearing
   formulas possibly represented peptide and nucleotide formulas suggesting
   preservation of these molecules in the life inhibiting environment of
   the Discovery Basin. Our unique data set provides the basis for a
   comprehensive understanding of the molecular signatures in pore water
   DOM and the turnover of sedimentary organic matter in marine sediments.

Abstract = {{To test the hypothesis that particle composition has a stronger
   influence on the community structure of particle-attached than
   free-living bacteria, elemental (C/N, delta C-13, and delta N-15) and
   chemical composition of particles and the size-fractionated bacterial
   community composition were examined along the particle density gradient
   from the Pearl River to the open basin in the South China Sea. Microbial
   communities were collected at the three size fractions of 0.2-0.8,
   0.8-3, and > 3 mu m, and the community composition was analyzed using
   high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 regions).
   Multivariate analysis evaluating the similarities of bacterial community
   composition and chemical composition of particles revealed their general
   consistent spatial variations along the particle density gradient from
   freshwater to the sea basin. However, compositions of particulate
   organic matter were more strongly related to the free living than to the
   particle-attached bacterial community composition, which was composed of
   relatively abundant anaerobic bacteria and those taxa preferring
   low-oxygen conditions. This latter result might be caused by low-oxygen
   microzones in particles. Community network models further revealed
   tighter interactions within the particle-attached than in free-living
   bacterial communities, suggesting that a relatively confined space in
   particles is more favorable for interactions within the community. These
   analyses indicated that particle microniche properties might be
   important in shaping particle-attached community structure. In contrast,
   particulate organic matter compositions significantly influenced the
   free-living bacterial community probably through the release of labile
   or semilabile organic matter from particles contributing to the
   bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon.}},

Abstract = {{Within natural waters, photodependent processes are generally considered
   the predominant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a suite of
   biogeochemically important molecules. However, recent discoveries of
   dark particle-associated ROS production in aquatic environments and
   extracellular ROS production by various microorganisms point to
   biological activity as a significant source of ROS in the absence of
   light. Thus, the objective of this study was to explore the occurrence
   of dark biological production of the ROS superoxide (O2(-)) and hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2) in brackish and freshwater ponds. Here we show that the
   ROS superoxide and hydrogen peroxide were present in dark waters at
   comparable concentrations as in sunlit waters. This suggests that, at
   least for the short-lived superoxide species, light-independent
   processes were an important control on ROS levels in these natural
   waters. Indeed, we demonstrated that dark biological production of ROS
   extensively occurred in brackish and freshwater environments, with
   greater dark ROS production rates generally observed in the aphotic
   relative to the photic zone. Filtering and formaldehyde inhibition
   confirmed the biological nature of a majority of this dark ROS
   production, which likely involved phytoplankton, particle-associated
   heterotrophic bacteria, and NADH-oxidizing enzymes. We conclude that
   biological ROS production is widespread, including regions devoid of
   light, thereby expanding the relevance of these reactive molecules to
   all regions of our oxygenated global habit.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence was used to examine the quality of dissolved and
   particulate organic matter (DOM and POM) exchanging between a tidal
   creek in a created salt marsh and its adjacent estuary in eastern North
   Carolina, USA. Samples from the creek were collected hourly over four
   tidal cycles in May, July, August, and October 2011. Absorbance and
   fluorescence of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) and of base-extracted POM
   (BEPOM) served as the tracers for organic matter quality while dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) and base-extracted particulate organic carbon
   (BEPOC) were used to compute fluxes. Fluorescence was modeled using
   parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and principle components analysis
   (PCA) of the PARAFAC results. Of nine PARAFAC components (C) modeled, C3
   represented recalcitrant DOM and C4 represented fresher soil-derived
   source DOM. Component 1 represented detrital POM, and C6 represented
   planktonic POM. Based on mass balance, recalcitrant DOC export was
   86gCm(-2)yr(-1) and labile DOC export was 49gCm(-2)yr(-1); no planktonic
   DOC was exported. The marsh also exported 41gCm(-2)yr(-1) of detrital
   terrestrial POC, which likely originated from lands adjacent to the
   North River estuary. Planktonic POC export from the marsh was
   6gCm(-2)yr(-1). Assuming the exported organic matter was oxidized to CO2
   and scaled up to global salt marsh area, respiration of salt marsh DOC
   and POC transported to estuaries could amount to a global CO2 flux of
   11TgCyr(-1), roughly 4\% of the recently estimated CO2 release for
   marshes and estuaries globally.}},

   various major oceanic water masses}},
Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{164}},

Abstract = {{A high-recovery technique of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolation -
   reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis (RO/ED) - was used to
   isolate DOM from the North Atlantic Senegal-Mauritanian upwelling area
   surface water (5 m), North Atlantic oxygen minimum water (415 m) and
   deep water (3000 m), North Pacific subtropical gyre surface water (5 m),
   and North Pacific intermediate water (674 m) and deep water (3500 m).
   Samples were characterized by ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (ES!
   FTICR-MS). RO/ED isolated DOM samples share a significant number of
   common formulas accounting for 54-79\% of formulas in each sample. Total
   dissolved carbohydrate (TCHO) concentrations in RO/ED isolated DOM were
   specifically measured using a colorimetric method, and were found to
   have higher contribution to DOC than estimated by FTICR-MS data.
   Percentages of TCHO-C in DOC are in the range of 3.7-19.6\% in all
   samples, with the North Pacific deep (3500 m) water having the lowest \%
   and the North Atlantic upwelling core surface water having the highest
   \%. Principal component analysis (PCA) using the relative magnitudes of
   MS peaks facilitated identification of specific peaks that are enriched
   in different samples. Peaks enriched in surface samples have higher H/C
   values than peaks enriched in deep samples, in both the North Atlantic
   DOM and the North Pacific DOM. This enrichment pattern is likely due to
   the selective photo-degradation of aromatic compounds and the
   bio-production of aliphatic and carbohydrate-like compounds in surface
   waters, and the selective bio-degradation of aliphatic and
   carbohydrate-like compounds with increasing depth. In further support of
   a photo-degraded signature for DOM in surface waters, photo-resistant
   and photo-produced molecular formulas were present in the highest
   numbers in the surface North Pacific subtropical gyre DOM. Peaks
   enriched in the North Pacific intermediate and deep DOM have
   significantly higher O/C values than the North Atlantic oxygen minimum
   layer and deep DOM, for both CHO formula compounds and CHON formula
   compounds. This difference in O/C values observed for the deep Pacific
   vs. Atlantic suggests oxidation of DOM, possibly via microbial activity
   during the ageing of DOM or the preferential remineralization of DOM
   from sinking particles at depth in the Pacific. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Recent work has shown the presence of anomalous dissolved organic matter
   (DOM), with high optical yields, in deep waters 15 months after the
   Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Here, we
   continue to use the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM)
   technique coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling,
   measurements of bulk organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC),
   oil indices, and other optical properties to examine the chemical
   evolution and transformation of oil components derived from the DWH in
   the water column of the GOM. Seawater samples were collected from the
   GOM during July 2012, 2 years after the oil spill. This study shows
   that, while dissolved organic carbon (DOC) values have decreased since
   just after the DWH spill, they remain higher at some stations than
   typical deep-water values for the GOM. Moreover, we continue to observe
   fluorescent DOM components in deep waters, similar to those of degraded
   oil observed in lab and field experiments, which suggest that
   oil-related fluorescence signatures, as part of the DOM pool, have
   persisted for 2 years in the deep waters. This supports the notion that
   some oil-derived chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) components
   could still be identified in deep waters after 2 years of degradation,
   which is further supported by the lower DIC and partial pressure of
   carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) associated with greater amounts of these
   oil-derived components in deep waters, assuming microbial activity on
   DOM in the current water masses is only the controlling factor of DIC
   and pCO(2) concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Distributions of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the upper
   400 m of the southern Canada Basin and East Siberian Sea were determined
   using an in situ WETStar fluorometer and fluorescence spectroscopy
   during cruises in 2008 as part of the Canada/US Joint Ocean Ice Study
   and Japan's International Polar Year program. Despite the low CDOM range
   (0.009-0.069 r.u.) observed in the upper 400 m of the study area, our
   results show that CDOM can be quantified from in situ DOM fluorescence
   sensor measurements. Unlike DOC concentrations, which are known to
   decrease with increasing depth, a pronounced mid-depth CDOM maximum was
   associated with the Pacific-derived winter water throughout our study
   area. Using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to resolve dominant
   fluorophore components in fluorescence excitation-emission matrices
   (EEM), we identified three humic-like and two proteinaceous components.
   The nature and origin of these five fluorophores were investigated based
   on their fluorescent characteristics as well as their vertical and
   geographical distributions. The lowest terrestrial humic-like signals in
   the surface waters were mostly due to photochemical processes, whereas
   the highest microbial/marine humic-like signal revealed interactions
   with sediment during the formation of Pacific-origin haloclines over the
   Arctic shelves. The humic-like fluorophores dominated DOM fluorescence
   in the Westernmost region in the East Siberian Sea whereas the
   contribution of protein-like fluorophores was predominant elsewhere. The
   significant difference in CDOM composition between East and West of the
   180 degrees meridian suggests the presence of a front that divides our
   study area into the Eastern Chukchi-Beaufort and East Siberian sides.
   This indicates a change in water circulation, and that more than one DOM
   source affects our study area. Unlike proteinaceous material, the
   humic-like compounds varied significantly in the halocline. Ten to 20
   percent enrichment was observed in terrestrially-derived DOM in the two
   Pacific-derived haloclines relative to the Atlantic-derived lower
   halocline. The application of PARAFAC modeling on fluorescent DOM is
   shown to be an important tool to investigate the dynamics and transport
   of allochthonous DOM in the Arctic Ocean. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Carbon monoxide apparent quantum yields and photoproduction in the Tyne
   estuary}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{703-713}},
Abstract = {{Carbon monoxide (CO) apparent quantum yields (AQYs) are reported for a
   suite of riverine, estuarine and sea water samples, spanning a range of
   coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) sources, diagenetic histories,
   and concentrations (absorption coefficients). CO AQYs were highest for
   high CDOM riverine samples and almost an order of magnitude lower for
   low CDOM coastal seawater samples. CO AQYs were between 47 and 80\%
   lower at the mouth of the estuary than at its head. Whereas, a
   conservative mixing model predicted only 8 to 14\% decreases in CO AQYs
   between the head and mouth of the estuary, indicating that a highly
   photoreactive pool of terrestrial CDOM is lost during estuarine transit.
   The CDOM absorption coefficient (a) at 412 nm was identified as a good
   proxy for CO AQYs (linear regression r(2) > 0.8; n = 12) at all CO AQY
   wavelengths studied (285, 295, 305, 325, 345, 365, and 423 nm) and
   across environments (high CDOM river, low CDOM river, estuary and
   coastal sea). These regressions are presented as empirical proxies
   suitable for the remote sensing of CO AQYs in natural waters, including
   open ocean water, and were used to estimate CO AQY spectra and CO
   photoproduction in the Tyne estuary based upon annually averaged
   estuarine CDOM absorption data. A minimum estimate of annual CO
   production was determined assuming that only light absorbed by CDOM
   leads to the formation of CO and a maximum limit was estimated assuming
   that all light entering the water column is absorbed by CO producing
   photoreactants (i.e. that particles are also photoreactive). In this
   way, annual CO photoproduction in the Tyne was estimated to be between
   0.99 and 3.57 metric tons of carbon per year, or 0.004 to 0.014\% of
   riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) inputs to the estuary.
   Extrapolation of CO photoproduction rates to estimate total DOC
   photomineralisation indicate that less than 1\% of DOC inputs are
   removed via photochemical processes during transit through the Tyne
   estuary.}},

Abstract = {{Benthic foraminifera are heterotrophic protists that utilize different
   trophic mechanisms and nutritional resources. They exhibit a wide range
   of trophic behaviours: selective (grazing) and indiscriminate herbivory,
   symbiosis, carnivory, parasitism, uptake of dissolved organic matter,
   passive suspension feeding and, most commonly, deposit feeding. The
   benthic foraminifera Ammonia tepida, previously known as an herbivore,
   fed as a carnivore in laboratory experiments where mobile metazoans were
   provided. We observed predation on the three types of metazoans
   provided: nematodes, copepods, and a larval gastropod. This foraminifera
   used its pseudopodial network to entrap the invertebrates, which were
   then stripped of their soft internal tissues within 24 hours. Our
   experiments are the first to demonstrate that Ammonia tepida, despite
   its limited motility, is able to utilize larger mobile animals as a food
   source. The great abundance of small metazoans in most marine
   environments suggests that they are a food source for foraminifera.
   Further study of foraminiferal feeding strategies will enhance our
   understanding of their role in marine communities.}},

Abstract = {{The decomposition of jellyfish after major bloom events results in the
   release of large amounts of nutrients, which can significantly alter
   nutrient and oxygen dynamics in the surrounding environment. The
   response of the ambient bacterial community to decomposing jellyfish
   biomass was evaluated in two marine ecosystems, the Gulf of Trieste
   (northern Adriatic Sea) and Big Lake (Mljet Island, southern Adriatic
   Sea). The major difference between these two ecosystems is that Aurelia
   sp. medusae occur throughout the year in the oligotrophic Big Lake,
   whereas in the mesotrophic Gulf of Trieste, they occur only seasonally
   and often as blooms. Addition of homogenized jellyfish to enclosed
   bottles containing ambient water from each of these systems triggered
   considerable changes in the bacterial community dynamics and in the
   nutrient regime. The high concentrations of protein, dissolved organic
   phosphorous (DOP), and PO4 (3-) immediately after homogenate addition
   stimulated increase in bacterial abundance and production rate, coupled
   with NH4 (+) accumulation in both ecosystems. Our preliminary results of
   the bacterial community structure, as determined with denaturing
   gradient gel electrophoresis, indicated differences in the bacterial
   community response between the two ecosystems. Despite divergence in the
   bacterial community responses to jellyfish homogenate, increased
   bacterial biomass and growth rates in both distinctive marine systems
   indicate potentially significant effects of decaying jellyfish blooms on
   microbial plankton.}},

Abstract = {{Green Bay, while representing only similar to 7\% of the surface area
   and similar to 1.4\% of the volume of Lake Michigan, contains one-third
   of the watershed of the lake, and receives approximately one-third of
   the total nutrient loading to the Lake Michigan basin, largely from the
   Fox River at the southern end of the bay. With a history of eutrophic
   conditions dating back nearly a century, the southern portion of the bay
   behaves as an efficient nutrient and sediment trap, sequestering much of
   the annual carbon and nitrogen input within sediments accumulating at up
   to 1 cm per year. Depositional fluxes of organic matter varied from
   similar to 0.1 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) to > 10 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) and were
   both fairly uniform in stoichiometric composition and relatively labile.
   Estimates of benthic recycling derived from pore-water concentration
   gradients, whole-sediment incubation experiments, and deposition-burial
   models of early diagenesis yielded an estimated 40\% of the carbon and
   50\% of the nitrogen recycled back into the overlying water.
   Remineralization was relatively rapid with similar to 50\% of the carbon
   remineralized within < 15 yr of deposition, and a mean residence time
   for metabolizable carbon and nitrogen in the sediments of 20 yr. On
   average, organic carbon regeneration occurred as 75\% CO2, 15\% CH4, and
   10\% dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Carbon and nitrogen budgets for the
   southern bay were based upon direct measurements of inputs and burial
   and upon estimates of export and production derived stoichiometrically
   from a coupled phosphorus budget. Loadings of organic carbon from rivers
   were similar to 3.7 mol m(-2) yr(-1), 80\% in the form of DOC and 20\%
   as particulate organic carbon. These inputs were lost through export to
   northern Green Bay and Lake Michigan (39\%), through sediment burial
   (26\%), and net CO2 release to the atmosphere (35\%). Total carbon
   input, including new production, was 4.54 mol m(-2) C yr(-1), equivalent
   to,10\% of the gross annual primary production. Nitrogen budget terms
   were less well quantified, with nitrogen export similar to 54\% of total
   inputs and burial similar to 24\%, leaving an unquantified residual loss
   term in the nitrogen budget of similar to 22\%.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved DNA (dDNA) is a potentially important source of energy and
   nutrients in aquatic ecosystems. However, little is known about the
   identity, metabolism, and interactions of the microorganisms capable of
   consuming dDNA. Bacteria from Eel Pond (Woods Hole, MA) were cultivated
   on low-molecular-weight (LMW) or high-molecular-weight (HMW) dDNA, which
   served as the primary source of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus.
   Cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that distinct
   bacterial assemblages with comparable levels of taxon richness developed
   on LMW and HMW dDNA. Since the LMW and HMW dDNA used in this study were
   stoichiometrically identical, the results confirm that the size alone of
   dissolved organic matter can influence bacterial community composition.
   Variation in the growth and metabolism of isolates provided insight into
   mechanisms that may have generated differences in bacterial community
   composition. For example, bacteria from LMW dDNA enrichments generally
   grew better on LMW dDNA than on HMW dDNA. In contrast, bacteria isolated
   from HMW dDNA enrichments were more effective at degrading HNIW dDNA
   than bacteria isolated from LMW dDNA enrichments. Thus, marine bacteria
   may experience a trade-off between their ability to compete for LMW dDNA
   and their ability to access HMW dDNA via extracellular nuclease
   production. Together, the results of this study suggest that dDNA
   turnover in marine ecosystems may involve a succession of microbial
   assemblages with specialized ecological strategies.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{110}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] A series of biogeochemical studies were conducted at the southern
   summit of Hydrate Ridge, offshore Oregon. Using the submersible DSV
   Alvin, sediment push cores were collected from two distinct seep
   environments characterized by the presence of clam fields (CF) or
   microbial mats (MM) at the sediment-water interface; samples were also
   collected from a nearby reference site characterized by a barren surface
   at the sediment-water interface. Sediment samples from each setting were
   analyzed for the depth distributions of total organic carbon
   (concentrations, delta C-13 and Delta C-14), total sedimentary nitrogen,
   and microbial abundance. Pore fluids were extracted and analyzed for
   sulfate, alkalinity, sulfide, organic carbon, and volatile organic
   acids. These depth distributions clearly indicate the presence of three
   distinctive biogeochemical settings in the surface sediments of Hydrate
   Ridge, and provide the basis for a comparative biogeochemical analysis.
   Both CF and MM sites display properties indicating enhanced microbial
   activity in the subsurface, compared with the reference site. MM sites
   display evidence of net biomass production in the subsurface; however, a
   loss of sediment nitrogen relative to the reference site indicates that
   mineralization is also enhanced. Calculations based on the removal of
   nitrogen indicate that greater than 30\% of autochthonous organic
   material is lost to enhanced mineralization in the top 23 cm of one MM
   site. An isotope mass balance of sediment-bound organic carbon indicates
   a mixed source, including methane and allochthonous organic carbon
   dissolved in the seep fluids. The concentrations of organic carbon
   dissolved in seep fluids reach values of 22 mM and provide a first
   indication that advective transport of dissolved organic carbon from
   great depth may supply an important source of energy and carbon to
   ``methane seep'' communities.}},

Abstract = {{We studied heterotrophic bacterial dynamics as part of the Southern
   Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX), January-February 2002. Two phytoplankton
   blooms were monitored following infusions with iron sulfate (FeSO(4)).
   The first bloom was initiated north of the Antarctic Polar Front Zone
   (APFZ) in silica-poor waters (North Patch) and was observed sporadically
   over 42 d, whereas the second was south of the APFZ in silica-rich
   waters (South Patch) and was continuously observed for 30 d. In both
   experiments, iron additions resulted in increased chlorophyll a (Chl a),
   particulate organic matter (POC + PN), and a drawdown of inorganic
   nutrients. Heterotrophic bacteria responded by increasing their
   abundance (110\% and 60\% increases in bacterial abundance in the North
   and South Patch, respectively, relative to nonenriched waters).
   Thymidine (TdR) and leucine (Leu) incorporation rates in the North Patch
   increased by 400\% and 120\%, respectively, with more modest increases
   in the South Patch (80\% and 70\%, respectively). In the South Patch,
   bacterial production (BP) was significantly correlated with net
   particulate primary production (PP) and Chl a. Bacterial abundance was
   also significantly correlated with Chl a. Net bacterial accumulation
   rate in the South Patch was 0.02 d(-1) over 17 d, excluding physical
   dilution by mixing with water outside the South Patch. The evidence
   suggests that bacterial growth during Southern Ocean Iron Experiment
   (SOFeX) was limited by labile carbon rather than by iron. Despite the
   close association of BP to PP, BP remained a small fraction of PP
   (<10\%).}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a major reservoir in the ocean carbon
   cycle, is produced by a profusion of plankton sources and processes but
   is consumed mainly by bacterioplankton. Thus bacterial metabolism
   regulates the entry of DOC into the longer scale global carbon cycle.
   Bacterial production (BP) is the routinely measured quantity for
   evaluating the roles of bacteria in carbon cycling. However BP cannot be
   measured directly and instead is estimated from related metabolic
   processes requiring the use of poorly constrained conversion factors. BP
   and thus the total carbon utilization, are potentially uncertain by a
   factor of two or more. In the North Atlantic Bloom Experiment (NABE), BP
   was estimated to be about 30\% of the simultaneous particulate primary
   production (PP), with some daily estimates exceeding 50\%. Here we
   reassess these estimates, synthesizing knowledge and understanding of
   plankton dynamics gained since the 1989 NABE study. Daily BP derived
   from six different conversion factors averaged 20\% of PP but ranged
   from 3 to 68\%. The coupling of BP to PP was not consistent with either
   short-term cycling of labile DOC (hours) nor with much longer term
   cycling of semilabile DOC (seasons). Trophodynamic processes, including
   release of DOC from phytoplankton, by themselves could have maintained
   BP at about 15\% of PP. Use of decomposing POC or previously accumulated
   semilabile DOC could each have supported some additional increment of BP
   for brief periods. Both reconsideration of observations and model
   results indicated that higher estimates of BP exceeding 20\% of PP could
   not be supported without extraordinary and prolonged inputs of
   allochthonous carbon. Recent assertions of high BP in the tropics and
   other oceanic regimes should be considered carefully, especially if
   external subsidies are not obvious.}},

   (r = 0. 143, p = 0.068). Phytoplankton-derived POC accounted for a
   certain fraction (only ambiguously estimated at 20 to 60\%) of total
   POC, and about 20\% of POC was ascribable to bacterioplankton biomass.
   The remaining POC was assumed to be non-phytoplanktonic,
   non-bacterioplanktonic sources such as phytodetritus and terrigenous
   matter. Therefore, it is suggested that bacterioplankton abundance may
   depend primarily on phytoplankton-derived DOC whereas thraustochytrid
   abundance is more influenced by non-phytoplankton, non-bacterioplankton
   POC. That is, planktonic degraders, thraustochytrids and
   bacterioplankton, decompose substrates of different origins and sizes.
   The potential ecological importance of the thaustochytrids as active
   degraders of POC and as an alternative food source is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Dimethylsulfide (DMS) gas constitutes 90\% of biogenic sulfur emissions
   from oceans and is an important agent in climate regulation. DMS in
   seawater arises primarily via lyase degradation of
   dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), an osmolyte produced in high
   concentrations by some marine phytoplankton. After being induced to
   synthesize DMSP lyase, cells of a marine bacterium (Alcaligenes strain
   M3A) significantly reduce their rate of change in direction and tumbling
   frequency, and they are attracted to DMSP at levels similar to those
   occurring near senescing phytoplankton cells (10(-7)-10(-6) M). In
   contrast, genetically identical bacteria without lyase induction are not
   attracted to DMSP. Combined with lyase activity, bacterial chemotaxis to
   DMSP could increase the rate of DMS production and therefore play a
   critical role in biogeochemical sulfur cycling between dissolved organic
   matter in seawater and the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{The detailed distribution of algal chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments
   was determined around the halocline (freshwater-seawater interface) in
   the Krka Estuary on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea, in May 1988. 
   After collection of water along the estuary, particulate matter was
   extracted and analyzed for pigments by high-performance liquid
   chromotography coupled with absorbance and fluorescence detection. 
   Bottom marine waters were characterized by lower chlorophyll a (chl a)
   concentration than encountered in surface waters, decreasing downstream
   from 0.50-mu-g l-1 to 0.16-mu-g l-1 at the marine end-member.  The
   highest concentrations of chl a (up to 26.34-mu-g l-1) were found in the
   interfacial layer, an particularly at one station located off the city
   of Sibenik, where high inputs of nutrients supported the accumulation of
   living algae at the halocline.  Fucoxanthin was the most abundant
   carotenoid, which indicates a euryhaline dominance of diatoms in the
   estuary, whereas the dinoflagellate-derived carotenoid peridinin was
   confined to the interfacial and bottom saline waters of the inner
   estuary.  High concentrations of alloxanthin and chl b were found in the
   interfacial layer, which also suggests an accumulation of Cryptophyceae
   and green algae in the inner estuary.  Phaeophorbides showed higher
   concentrations in bottom waters than in surface waters, whereas the
   highest concentrations occurred in the interfacial layer.  These high
   levels could reflect a density trapping of dead cells in an early
   degradation state, as suggested by the importance of allomerized chl a
   and chlorophyllide a vs. total chl a, or of faecal pellets originating
   from zooplankton grazing in the interfacial layer.}},

   microplastics was analyzed using different kinetic and isotherm models,

   the sorption kinetics of PBDEs, and surface sorption was the main
   mechanism. The sorption of PBDEs by microplastics was a multilayer and
   physical process. Low temperatures reduced BDE-47 sorption on

   Microbial Community Composition and Function}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{Increased river loads are projected as one of the major consequences of
   climate change in the northern hemisphere, leading to elevated inputs of
   riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM) and inorganic nutrients to
   coastal ecosystems. The objective of this study was to investigate the
   effects of elevated DOM on a coastal pelagic food web from the coastal
   northern Baltic Sea, in a 32-day mesocosm experiment. In particular, the
   study addresses the response of bacterioplankton to differences in
   character and composition of supplied DOM. The supplied DOM differed in
   stoichiometry and quality and had pronounced effects on the recipient
   bacterioplankton, driving compositional changes in response to DOM type.
   The shifts in bacterioplankton community composition were especially
   driven by the proliferation of Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes,
   Planctomycetes, and Alpha-and Betaproteobacteria populations. The DOM
   additions stimulated protease activity and a release of inorganic
   nutrients, suggesting that DOM was actively processed. However, no
   difference between DOM types was detected in these functions despite
   different community compositions. Extensive release of re-mineralized
   carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus was associated with the bacterial
   processing, corresponding to 25-85\% of the supplied DOM. The DOM
   additions had a negative effect on phytoplankton with decreased Chl a
   and biomass, particularly during the first half of the experiment.
   However, the accumulating nutrients likely stimulated phytoplankton
   biomass which was observed to increase towards the end of the
   experiment. This suggests that the nutrient access partially outweighed
   the negative effect of increased light attenuation by accumulating DOM.
   Taken together, our experimental data suggest that parts of the future
   elevated riverine DOM supply to the Baltic Sea will be efficiently
   mineralized by microbes. This will have consequences for
   bacterioplankton and phytoplankton community composition and function,
   and significantly affect nutrient biogeochemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Marine bacteria form one of the largest living surfaces on Earth, and
   their metabolic activity is of fundamental importance for global
   nutrient cycling. Here, we explored the largely unknown intracellular
   pathways in 25 microbes representing different classes of marine
   bacteria that use glucose: Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and
   Flavobacteriia of the Bacteriodetes phylum. We used C-13 isotope
   experiments to infer metabolic fluxes through their carbon core
   pathways. Notably, 90\% of all strains studied use the Entner-Doudoroff
   (ED) pathway for glucose catabolism, whereas only 10\% rely on the
   Embden-Meyer-hof-Parnas (EMP) pathway. This result differed dramatically
   from the terrestrial model strains studied, which preferentially used
   the EMP pathway yielding high levels of ATP. Strains using the ED
   pathway exhibited a more robust resistance against the oxidative stress
   typically found in this environment. An important feature contributing
   to the preferential use of the ED pathway in the oceans could therefore
   be enhanced supply of NADPH through this pathway. The marine bacteria
   studied did not specifically rely on a distinct anaplerotic route, but
   the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or pyruvate for fueling
   of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was evenly distributed. The marine
   isolates studied belong to clades that dominate the uptake of glucose, a
   major carbon source for bacteria in seawater. Therefore, the ED pathway
   may play a significant role in the cycling of mono- and polysaccharides
   by bacterial communities in marine ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in the ocean's
   biological carbon pump by providing an advective/mixing pathway for
   similar to 20\% of export production. DOM is known to have a
   stoichiometry depleted in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) compared to
   the particulate organic matter pool, a fact that is often omitted from
   biogeochemical ocean general circulation models. However the variable C:
   N: P stoichiometry of DOM becomes important when quantifying carbon
   export from the upper ocean and linking the nutrient cycles of N and P
   with that of carbon. Here we utilize recent advances in DOM
   observational data coverage and offline tracer-modeling techniques to
   objectively constrain the variable production and remineralization rates
   of the DOM C : N: P pools in a simple biogeochemical-ocean model of DOM
   cycling. The optimized DOM cycling parameters are then incorporated
   within the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) component of the
   Community Earth System Model (CESM) and validated against the
   compilation of marine DOM observations. The optimized BEC simulation
   including variable DOM C: N: P cycling was found to better reproduce the
   observed DOM spatial gradients than simulations that used the canonical
   Redfield ratio. Global annual average export of dissolved organic C, N,
   and P below 100 m was found to be 2.28 PgC yr(-1) (143 TmolC yr(-1)),
   16.4 Tmol Nyr(-1), and 1 Tmol P yr(-1), respectively, with an average
   export C : N: P stoichiometry of 225 : 19 : 1 for the semilabile
   (degradable) DOM pool. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export contributed
   similar to 25\% of the combined organic C export to depths greater than
   100 m.}},

Abstract = {{The bioavailability of predegraded dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a
   humic-rich, boreal river to estuarine bacteria from the Baltic Sea was
   studied in 39-day bioassays. The river waters had been exposed to
   various degrees of bacterial degradation by storing them between 0 and
   465 days in dark prior to the bioassay. The resulting predegraded DOM
   was inoculated with estuarine bacteria and the subsequent changes in DOM
   quantity and quality measured. During the incubations, dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) and oxygen concentrations decreased, indicating
   heterotrophic activity. Coloured DOM was degraded less than DOC,
   indicating a selective utilization of DOM, and humic-like fluorescence
   components increased during the incubations. The amount of DOC degraded
   was not affected by the length of DOM predegradation. The percentage of
   bioavailable DOC (\%BDOC) was higher in experiment units with added
   inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus than without addition (on average 13.5
   \% and 9.0, respectively), but had no effect on the degradation of
   fresh, non-predegraded, DOC (\%BDOC 12.0 \%). Bacterial growth
   efficiency (BGE) was highest (65 +/- A 2 \%) in the units with fresh
   DOM, and lowest in units with predegraded DOM and no added inorganic
   nutrients (11 +/- A 4 \%). The addition of inorganic nutrients increased
   the BGE of predegraded DOM units by an average of 28 +/- A 4 \%. There
   was no significant effect on BGE by length of predegradation after the
   initial drop (< 3 months). This study suggests that both the length of
   predegradation and the inorganic nutrient status in the receiving
   estuary has consequences to carbon cycling and will determine the amount
   of terrestrial-derived DOC being ultimately assimilated into marine food
   webs.}},

Abstract = {{The optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were
   investigated for the first time in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago
   (CAA), Baffin Bay (BB), and Labrador Sea (LS) as part of the
   International Polar Year Canada's Three Oceans project (C3O). The
   dynamics and composition of absorbing DOM (i.e., colored DOM, or CDOM)
   and fluorescent DOM (FDOM) were evaluated in several distinct water
   masses occupying the three regions: surface waters, Arctic outflow
   waters, West Greenland Intermediate waters (WGIW), upper Labrador Sea
   waters (uLSW), and Bottom Baffin Deep Water (BBDW). Four fluorescent
   components were identified by applying parallel factor analysis
   (PARAFAC) to 522 excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra: three
   humic-like and one protein-like. The FDOM in surface waters of the CAA
   and BB differed considerably in character from those of the LS, with
   higher fluorescence intensity in the former. The fluorescence
   intensities of the two terrestrial humic-like components (C1 and C3)
   were linearly correlated with apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) in the
   CAA Arctic outflow and the WGIW whereas only humic-like C3 was
   significantly correlated with AOU in uLSW. These findings suggest that
   the humic-like components were produced in situ as organic matter was
   bio-oxidized. The slopes of the linear relationship between humic-like
   intensity and AOU were significantly greater in the WGIW relative to the
   Arctic outflow waters, which implies that FDOM in the Arctic-derived
   deeper layer was less prone to mineralization.}},

Title = {{Chronic ecotoxic effects to Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio fischeri, and
   cytostatic and genotoxic effects to the hepatoma cell line (HepG2) of
   ofloxacin photo(cata)lytically treated solutions}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{450}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Ofloxacin (OFL), a broad-spectrum and widespread-used photolabile
   fluoroquinolone, is frequently found in treated wastewaters, aquatic and
   terrestrial ecosystems leading to increasing concern during the past
   decades regarding its effects to the environment and human health. The
   elimination of OFL and other xenobiotics by the application of advanced
   oxidation processes using photolytic (PL) and photocatalytic (PC)
   treatments seems promising. However, an integrated assessment scheme is
   needed, in which, not only the removal of the parent compound, but also
   the effects of the photo-transformation products (PTPs) are
   investigated. For this purpose, in the present study, a chronic ecotoxic
   assessment using representative bacteria of marine and terrestrial
   ecosystems and a cytostatic and genotoxic evaluation using hepatoma cell
   line were performed. PL and PC treatments of OFL were applied using UV
   radiation. The photo-transformation of OFL during the treatments was
   monitored by DOC measurements and UPLC-MS/MS analysis. The chronic
   ecotoxicity of OFL and treated samples was evaluated using Pseudomonas
   putida and Vibrio fischeri; whereas the cytostasis and genotoxicity were
   estimated by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN). The main
   results suggest that photo-transformation of OFL took place during these
   treatments since the concentration of OFL decreased when the irradiation
   time increased, as quantified by UPLC-MS/MS analysis, and this was not
   coupled with an analogous DOC removal. Furthermore, nine compounds were
   identified as probable PTPs formed through piperazinyl dealkylation and
   decarboxylation. The ecotoxicity of treated solutions to the bacteria
   studied decreased while the cytostasis to the hepatoma cell line
   remained at low levels during both treatments. However, the genotoxicity
   to the hepatoma cell line demonstrated a different pattern in which
   treated samples induced a greater number of MNi for the 4-16 min of
   irradiation (p < 0.05) during both treatments. After 64 min of
   irradiation, the effects decreased to non genotoxic levels (p < 0.05).
   These findings suggest that UV radiation for various treatment processes
   (catalytic or not), such as disinfection, may create genotoxic
   by-products. Therefore, in relevant technical applications, the
   residence time during treatment should receive special attention. (c)

   the net build-up of both particulate (POC) and dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) were all enhanced at higher temperatures and almost doubled over a
   temperature gradient of 8 degrees C. Furthermore, elemental ratios of
   carbon and nitrogen (C : N) in both particulate and dissolved organic
   matter increased in response to higher temperatures, both reaching very
   high C : N ratios of > 30 at +4 degrees C. Altogether, these
   observations suggest a pronounced increase in excess carbon fixation in
   response to elevated temperatures. Most of these findings are contrary
   to results from similar experiments conducted with plankton populations
   sampled in spring, revealing large uncertainties in our knowledge of
   temperature sensitivities of key processes in marine carbon cycling.
   Since a major difference to previous mesocosm experiments was the
   dominant phytoplankton species, we hypothesize that species composition
   might play an important role in the response of biogeochemical cycling
   to increasing temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Photochemistry of dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role
   in marine biogeochemical cycles, including the regeneration of inorganic
   nutrients. DOM photochemistry affects nitrogen cycling by converting
   bio-refractory dissolved organic nitrogen to labile inorganic nitrogen,
   mainly ammonium (NH4+). During the August 2009 Mackenzie Light and
   Carbon (MALINA) Program, the absorbed photon-based efficiency spectra of
   NH4+ photoproduction (i.e. photoammonification) were determined using
   water samples from the SE Beaufort Sea, including the Mackenzie River
   estuary, shelf, and Canada Basin. The photoammonification efficiency
   decreased with increasing wavelength across the ultraviolet and visible
   regimes and was higher in offshore waters than in shelf and estuarine
   waters. The efficiency was positively correlated with the molar
   nitrogen:carbon ratio of DOM and negatively correlated with the
   absorption coefficient of chromophoric DOM (CDOM). Combined with
   collateral measurements of CO2 and CO photoproduction, this study
   revealed a stoichiometry of DOM photochemistry with a CO2 : CO : NH4+
   molar ratio of 165 : 11 : 1 in the estuary, 60 : 3 : 1 on the shelf, and
   18 : 2 : 1 in the Canada Basin. The NH4+ efficiency spectra, along with
   solar photon fluxes, CDOM absorption coefficients and sea ice
   concentrations, were used to model the monthly surface and
   depth-integrated photoammonification rates in 2009. The summertime
   (June-August) rates at the surface reached 6.6 nmol l(-1) d(-1) on the
   Mackenzie Shelf and 3.7 nmol l(-1) d(-1) further offshore; the
   depth-integrated rates were correspondingly 8.8 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) and
   11.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). The offshore depth-integrated rate in August
   (8.0 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) was comparable to the missing dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (DIN) source required to support the observed primary
   production in the upper 10-m layer of that area. The yearly NH4+
   photoproduction in the entire study area was estimated to be 1.4 x 10(8)
   moles, with 85\% of it being generated in summer when riverine DIN input
   is low. Photoammonification could mineralize 4\% of the annual dissolved
   organic nitrogen (DON) exported from the Mackenzie River and provide a
   DIN source corresponding to 7\% of the riverine DIN discharge and 1400
   times the riverine NH4+ flux. Under a climate warming-induced ice-free
   scenario, these quantities could increase correspondingly to 6\%, 11\%,
   and 2100 times. Photoammonification is thus a significant nitrogen
   cycling term and may fuel previously unrecognized autotrophic and
   heterotrophic production pathways in the surface SE Beaufort Sea.}},

Abstract = {{We targeted the warm, subsurface waters of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea
   (EMS) to investigate processes that are linked to the chemical
   composition and cycling of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seawater.
   The apparent respiration of semi-labile DOC accounted for 27 +/- 18\% of
   oxygen consumption in EMS mesopelagic and bathypelagic waters; this
   value is higher than that observed in the bathypelagic open ocean, so
   the chemical signals that accompany remineralization of DOC may thus be
   more pronounced in this region. Ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter
   (UDOM) collected from four deep basins at depths ranging from 2 to 4350
   m exhibited bulk chemical (H-1-NMR) and molecular level (amino acid and
   monosaccharide) abundances, composition, and spatial distribution that
   were similar to previous reports, except for a sample collected in the
   deep waters of the N. Aegean Sea that had been isolated for over a
   decade. The amino acid component of UDOM was tightly correlated with
   apparent oxygen utilization and prokaryotic activity, indicating its
   relationship with remineralization processes that occur over a large
   range of timescales. Principal component analyses of relative mole
   percentages of monomers revealed that oxygen consumption and prokaryotic
   activity were correlated with variability in amino acid distributions
   but not well correlated with monosaccharide distributions. Taken
   together, this study elucidates key relationships between the chemical
   composition of DOM and heterotrophic metabolism. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Import of organic materials in the form of compost, sludge or plant
   residues introduces large amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into
   soils. DOM as a dynamic soil component affects the behaviors of organic
   pollutants. Different DOM constituents may affect herbicide action in a
   different way. However, the process of interaction between the distinct
   DOM-fractions and herbicides is largely unknown. In this study, DOM was
   separated by size-fractionation into three molecular size groups: MW <
   3500 Da, 3500 Da < MW < 14 000 Da, and MW > 14 000 Da. Effects of
   DOM-fractions on prometryne sorption/desorption and mobility were
   analyzed using approaches of batch experiments, soil column and soil
   thin-layer chromatography. Application of varied DOM-fractions at 50 mg
   DOC L-1 to the soil reduced the sorption and increased desorption of
   prometryne. DOM-fraction with MW > 14 000 Da appeared most effective in
   prometryne mobilization in the soil than any other fractions. Finally,
   DOM-fractions were characterized by chemical analyses, fourier
   transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and excitation-emission
   matrices (EEMs) fluorescence spectroscopy. Our studies revealed that the
   high-molecular weight fraction contained more aromatic framework and
   unsaturated structure that was most likely the dominant factor
   modulating the behavior of prometryne in soils. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The spring-to-summer seasonal transition in the spatial and vertical
   distribution of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ( CDOM) optical
   properties was examined during surveys conducted in March, May, July,
   and August of 2005 in the waters influenced by the
   Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.
   Strong seasonal river influences and a well-correlated inverse
   relationship between CDOM absorption at 412 nm and salinity during
   spring of 2005 suggests conservative mixing in the water column between
   the riverine freshwater sources and the oceanic end members. Trends in
   the CDOM absorption and the spectral absorption slope ( S) and
   deviations from the end-member conservative mixing line in surface and
   bottom waters during the summer suggest apparent sources and sinks of
   CDOM. Elevated CDOM in lower-salinity surface waters at many stations
   appears to be linked to high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO; >10
   mg L-1) and elevated chlorophyll concentrations. Effects of
   photo-oxidation in surface waters were observed as increasing S and
   enhanced CDOM loss in the similar to 27-32 salinity range and were
   attributed to seasonal stratification and the increased solar radiation
   during the summer. In the bottom waters, elevated CDOM levels in the
   similar to 32-36 salinity range were associated with low DO and
   relatively higher bacterial abundance; this suggests a potential CDOM
   source due to microbial remineralization of organic matter in the
   hypoxic zone in bottom waters. Seasonal dynamics associated with CDOM
   loss in surface waters and CDOM gains in bottom waters may be another
   pathway influencing hypoxia in coastal waters.}},

Abstract = {{We report a study of the attenuation Of Submarine Photosynthetically
   Active Radiation (PAR) in relation to the concentrations of Optically
   Active Constituents (OACs) in a range of water types around the United
   Kingdom. 408 locations were visited between August 2004 and December
   2005. The diffuse attenuation coefficient A) was estimated from profiles
   of downwelling PAR. Concentrations of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM)
   were measured gravimetrically and concentrations of phytoplankton
   chlorophyll (chl) were measured by fluorometrically. Chromophoric
   Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) was measured either by fluorescence or
   as its proxy, salinity.
   Several empirical models for K-d as a function of SPM, chlorophyll and
   CDOM were fitted to the data set. It was found that including all three
   explanatory variables (CDOM, chlorophyll and SPM) gave a slightly better
   fit for coastal and offshore waters, whereas a fit based only on SPM and
   chlorophyll worked well for transitional (estuarine) waters. The use of
   SPM as a single predictor of K-d in all water types resulted in only 3\%
   loss of accuracy.
   The effect of seasonal variations in the light climate and the OACs was
   investigated with high frequency data from moorings in the Thames
   embayment and Liverpool Bay. K-d was estimated from data recorded from
   pairs of vertically separated PAR sensors. Using the empirical models to
   estimate Kd from these OACs showed that reliable estimates of
   attenuation could be made throughout the year, with some scatter of
   estimated K-d about observed K-d during the growing season,
   The reliability of these findings was validated by non-linearly fitting
   of a mechanistic model, based on semi-intrinsic optical parameters, to
   the spatial data set. Estimated values of absorption cross-section and
   scattering cross-section were in good agreement with the literature, and
   help to justify parameter values obtained from the empirical models, (C)

Abstract = {{The LUMISTox((R)) toxicity test was employed to assess the removal of
   municipal wastewater toxicity during the biological treatment with
   activated sludge in the wastewater treatment plant. of Thessaloniki,
   Greece. Possible associations of toxicity data with chemical parameters
   of organic pollution of wastewaters, namely BOD5, COD, DOC, SS and
   persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were also investigated. Toxicity
   and chemical parameters were concurrently measured at three sampling
   points of the treatment plant, the entrance of the unit (raw wastewater,
   RW), the effluent of the secondary sedimentation tank (SSE), and the
   final sewage sludge (FS).
   Substantial reduction of toxicity was observed from RW to SSE (mean +/-
   S.D. of bioluminescence inhibition 36 +/- 9.4\% and 13 +/- 4.0\%,
   respectively) indicating removal of toxicants during primary and
   secondary clarification, also suggesting that a large part of the
   toxicity measured is attributed to the biodegradable fraction of the
   organic content of wastewater.
   Significant positive correlations were observed between \% inhibition
   values and wastewater parameters (BOD, COD, SS). In sludge, correlations
   were in general poor. Negative strong correlation was observed between
   EC20/15 and TOC suggesting that the organic content of sludge
   contributes to the toxicity measured. Toxicity was positively correlated
   with the concentrations of certain POPs in RW, while weaker negative
   correlations were observed in SSE. Correlations in sewage sludge were
   less significant.
   It was concluded that toxicity testing is a useful tool supplementing
   chemical analyses in the evaluation of the potential hazard from
   effluent discharges and disposal of waste sludge. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   images of the central North Atlantic Ocean (1998-2003) show that

   phytoplankton pigment absorption coefficient in time. CDOM peaks
   (between January and March) and troughs (late summer and fall) followed
   pigment peaks and troughs by approximately two and four weeks,
   respectively. This phase shift is additional strong evidence that CDOM
   in the marine environment is derived from phytoplankton degradation. The
   common assumption of linear covariation between chloropyll and CDOM is a
   simplification even in this ocean gyre. Due to the temporal changes in
   CDOM, chlorophyll concentration estimated based on traditional remote

   the spring bloom and underestimated by a similar 10\% during the fall.

Abstract = {{In a mesocosm experiment providing a gradient of semi-continuous

   phytoplankton were estimated. Heterotrophic bacterial biomass and
   production rates and their responses to the mineral nutrients additions
   were also estimated. The purpose of the experiment was to establish
   responses of the major biological factors as a function of nutrient
   amendments. Initial primary production was similar to 0.47 mu g C L-1
   day(-1). In the most fertilized mesocosm, phytoplankton biomass
   increased at a specific rate of 0.4 day(-1) during the first week of the
   experiment, and on day 9 primary production reached a peak at 1027 mu g
   C L-1 day(-1). The responses in the other fertilized mesocosms were
   intermediate, and in an unfertilized control the variables measured
   stayed almost constant throughout the experiment. The termination of the
   blooms in the fertilized mesocosms was a consequence of nitrogen
   limitation, and nitrogen limitation subsequently induced storage of
   intracellular organic material in the phytoplankton. In the mesocosm
   receiving the highest daily dose of nutrients, strong post-bloom
   nutrient limitation resulted in high phytoplankton mortality, and
   release of organic material from the algae supported the gradient's
   highest heterotrophic bacterial production.}},

Abstract = {{On average, the water column of Lake Superior is undersaturated with
   respect to dissolved oxygen and supersaturated with respect to carbon
   dioxide during the summer-stratified period. On the basis of temporal
   changes in water column dissolved oxygen, we calculate rates of oxygen
   consumption that range from 0.19 to 0.75 mmol m(-1) d(-1). These rates
   are a factor of 5-10 times larger than can be supported by the
   particulate carbon settling rates and benthic oxygen consumption rates.
   In addition, on the basis of the limited information available,
   dissolved allochthonous carbon inputs are insufficient to account for
   the calculated rates of carbon oxidation. Rates of nitrate and total CO2
   (SigmaCO(2)) production are 0.019 +/- 0.012 and 0.13 +/- 0.06 mmol m(-3)
   d(-1), respectively, and are consistent with the oxidation of a
   dissolved organic component that is similar in composition (C: N ratio)
   to the settling particulate material. Previously published estimates of
   total primary production were smaller but similar in magnitude to our
   integrated water column respiration rates. We interpret the observed
   imbalance between particulate carbon delivered to the deep lake and the
   calculated rate of carbon oxidation to be the result of the
   decomposition of dissolved organic carbon that appears to have both an
   autochthonous and an allochthonous component.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the net exchange of

   episodes of resuspension. Surface sediment samples collected from six
   locations within the Hudson River Estuary and the Inner New York Bight
   were resuspended in their respective bottom waters for periods ranging
   from 30 s to 2 h. After resuspension, dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   concentration generally reached levels greater than that predicted by
   conservative mixing of pore water and bottom water, indicating net
   release of OC from the sediment particles. The amount of OC released
   during the 1-h extractions comprised less than or equal to0.1\% of the
   total sediment pool, but correlated positively (R-2 = 0.65, P < 0.052)
   with the amount of particulate organic carbon (POC) found in the
   high-density fraction of the sediment matrix. This suggests that the
   mineral-bound fraction of sedimentary OC was the major source for the
   excess DOC released into solution, and that across various sedimentary
   environments, only a small (but fairly constant) fraction of the total
   sedimentary POC may be poised for rapid transfer to the water column.

Abstract = {{: The effect of solar radiation on the bioavailability of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) was investigated during a cruise in the Southern
   Ocean (similar to 44.5 degreesS, 63 degreesE) in January and February
   1999. Seawater was collected in the chlorophyll maximum layer (CML, 30
   to 80 m depth) and in deep waters (DW, 200 to 5000 m depth), filtered
   through 0.2 pm pore-size filters, and exposed to surface solar
   irradiation for 8 h. The bisavailability of the irradiated DOM and of
   that in the corresponding dark treatment was subsequently tested in
   bioassay experiments performed in the dark. Seawater from the CML was
   also size-fractionated and the effect of solar radiation on the
   bioavailability of the <20 kDa DOM fraction was compared with that of
   the bulk DOM. Our results clearly demonstrate that the biological
   reactivity of DOM? from both the CML and DMI following exposure to solar
   radiation is inversely related to the initial bioavailability of the DOM
   Frier to its exposure. The photochemically induced stimulation of the
   bacterial activity was <similar to>2-fold higher in the <20 kDa fraction
   than in the bulk DOM. These results clearly indicate that initially
   bioreactive DOM can be rendered biologically more recalcitrant by
   exposure to solar radiation, while DOM of initially low bioavailability
   can be, at least partly, photochemically transformed to compounds of
   higher biological reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{A 13-compartment model of primary production and degradation of
   dissolved organic matter has been coupled with a general circulation
   model ir an open coastal environment (Gulf of Lions, Mediterranean) so
   as to quantify exchanges with the open sea. The biogeochemical model had
   been previously calibrated with a one-dimensional vertical version on a
   1-year data set, and this simulation provides boundary conditions for
   the three-dimensional model. After a 1-year spin-up simulation,
   quasi-equilibrium is obtained for all the compartments, and the results
   of an additional annual simulation are compared with coastal zone color
   scanner images and other data collected in the area: the simulation of
   chlorophyll a, nutrient concentrations, and primary production is quite
   satisfactory, although the spring bloom starts slightly earlier than
   usual. Total gross community production is estimated at 76 g C m(-2)
   y(-1), and New Gross Community Production at 45 g Carbon m(-2) y(-1) (f
   = 0.37). The model was used to understand the nitrate annual cycle in
   the coastal zone of the Gulf of Lions. Nitrate input from the Rhone
   river, from the sediment, and from marine advection are compared in
   terms of potential fertilization. Model results indicate that, regarding
   the open sea, the margin acts most of the time as a sink for nitrate.
   However, during winter, when phytoplankton growth is reduced and
   cascading of dense waters is active along the shelf, the margin is shown
   to export nitrate toward the open sea. These results may qualitatively

Abstract = {{The release of photosynthetically produced compounds by phytoplankton
   and their reassimilation by bacteria were studied in the
   oligomesotrophic Lake Pavin (Massif Central of France). Samples were
   collected monthly from April to November 1993 at the central station of
   the lake at depths of 1, 10 and 15 m. Release of dissolved organic
   products and bacterial reassimilation were assayed by the 14C method
   which permits the quantitative and qualitative study of phytoplankton
   exudates. Gel-permeation chromatography was used to separate
   phytoplankton exudates into different molecular weight products. Size
   fractionation was used to measure 14C fixation in three fractions: 160-1
   mu m (mainly phytoplankton), 1-0.2 mu m (mainly bacteria) and <0.2 mu m.
   The average per cent release of photosynthetically produced dissolved
   organic compounds by chlorophyllian protists is 10\% of algal primary
   production (range 2-45\%). Gel-permeation chromatography showed that
   low-molecular-weight products (<700 Da) dominated this excreted organic
   matter pool and were an important source of carbon for heterotrophic
   microorganisms, allowing the establishment of a microbial loop, owing to
   the heterotrophic bacterial reassimilation of exudates constituting up
   to 90\% (mean 42 +/- 22\%) of excreted products.}},

Abstract = {{Sponges are commonly divided into high (HMA) and low (LMA)
   microbial-abundance species according to the bacterial biomass in their
   tissue. These two groups reflect distinct aquiferous structures and
   feeding strategies. In the NW Mediterranean coralligenous community, HMA
   and LMA sponges are often packed in dense, multispecies assemblages that
   cover many pinnacles and overhangs. We investigated the metabolism of
   HMA and LMA species that cohabitate the coralligenous community by
   sampling in situ the inhaled and exhaled water. Sponges consumed
   plankton, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and ammonium in relation to
   their abundance in ambient water. The plankton retention efficiency was
   high for all species. DOC was the main source of C for the sponge
   species, accounting for similar to 90\% of the examined sources.
   Nitrogen fluxes markedly differed between the two groups: plankton was
   the main source of nitrogen for LMAs that excreted dissolved organic
   nitrogen (DON) and ammonium. The nitrogenous waste products of LMAs were
   found to be the major source of nitrogen (up to 97\%) for HMAs that
   efficiently removed DON and ammonium and excreted nitrate. The different
   capacity of both sponge strategies to use dissolved resources suggests a
   partial trophic niche separation related to HMA-LMA dichotomy as a
   mechanism facilitating their dense co-existence in the community. Our
   findings suggest that a mixed assemblage of sponges (and their
   associated microbes) is able to utilize the suspended particulate and
   dissolved material more efficiently than a single species population and
   may contribute to the understanding of the phenomena of the stability
   and diversity of dense sponge assemblages in oligotrophic habitats.}},

Title = {{Environmental Drivers of Dissolved Organic Matter Molecular Composition
   in the Delaware Estuary}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Estuaries as connectors of freshwater and marine aquatic systems are
   hotspots of biogeochemical element cycling. In one of the best studied
   temperate estuaries, the Delaware Estuary (USA), we investigated the
   variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) over five sampling cruises
   along the salinity gradient in August and November of 3 consecutive
   years. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were more variable
   in the upper reaches of the estuary (245 +/- 49 mu mol DOC L-1) than at
   the mouth of the estuary (129 +/- 14 mu mol L-1). Bulk DOC decreased
   conservatively along the transect in November but was non-conservative
   with increased DOC concentrations mid-estuary in August. Detailed
   analysis of the solid-phase extractable DOM pool via ultrahigh
   resolution mass spectrometry (Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance
   mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS) revealed compositional differences at the
   molecular level that were not reflected in changes in concentration.
   Besides the mixing of terrestrial and marine endmember signatures, river
   discharge levels and biological activity impacted DOM molecular
   composition. DOM composition changed less between August and November
   than along the salinity gradient. Relative contributions of presumed
   photolabile DOM compounds did not reveal non-conservative behavior
   indicative of photochemical processing, suggesting that on the
   timescales of estuarine mixing photochemical removal of molecules plays
   a minor role in the turbid Delaware Bay. Overall, a large portion of
   molecular formulae overlapped between sampling campaigns and persisted
   during estuarine passage. Extending the analysis to the structural level
   via the fragmentation of molecular masses in the FT-ICR-MS, we found
   that the relative abundance of isomers along the salinity gradient did
   not change, indicating a high structural similarity of aquatic DOM
   independent of the origin. These results point toward a recalcitrant
   character of the DOM supplied by the Delaware River. We demonstrate that
   in addition to bulk DOC quantification, detailed information on
   molecular composition is essential for constraining sources of DOM and
   to identify the processes that impact estuarine DOM, thereby controlling
   amount and composition of DOM eventually discharged to the ocean through
   estuaries.}},

Abstract = {{Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) contains one of the largest
   exchangeable organic carbon pools on Earth. Riverine input represents an
   important source of DOM to the oceans, yet much remains to be learned
   about the fate of the DOM linking terrestrial to oceanic carbon cycles
   through rivers at the global scale. Here we use ultrahigh-resolution
   mass spectrometry to identify 184 molecular formulae that are indicators
   of riverine inputs (referred to as t-Peaks) and to track their
   distribution in the deep North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. The
   t-Peaks were found to be enriched in the Amazon River, to be highly
   correlated with known tracers of terrigenous input, and to be observed
   in all samples from four different rivers characterized by vastly
   different landscapes and vegetation coverage spanning equatorial (Amazon
   and Congo), subtropical (Altamaha), and Arctic (Kolyma) regions. Their
   distribution reveals that terrigenous organic matter is injected into
   the deep ocean by the global meridional overturning circulation,
   indicating that a fraction of the terrigenous DOM introduced by rivers
   contributes to the DOM pool observed in the deep ocean and to the
   storage of terrigenous organic carbon. This novel molecular approach can
   be used to further constrain the transfer of DOM from land to sea,
   especially considering that Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance
   mass spectrometer analysis is becoming increasingly frequent in studies
   characterizing the molecular composition of DOM in lakes, rivers, and
   the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular formula assignment is one of the key challenges in processing
   high-field Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometric
   (FT-ICR-MS) datasets. The number of potential solutions for an elemental
   formula increases exponentially with increasing molecular mass,
   especially when non-oxygen heteroatoms like N, S or P are included. A
   method was developed from the chemical perspective and validated using a
   Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) dataset which is dominated by
   components consisting exclusively of C, H and O (78 \% CHO). In order to
   get information on the application range and robustness of this method,
   we investigated a FT-ICR-MS dataset which was merged from 18 mine pit
   lake pore waters and 3 river floodplain soil waters. This dataset
   contained 50 \% CHO and 18 \% CHOS on average, whereas the former SRFA
   dataset contained only 1.5 \% CHOS. The mass calculator was configured
   to allow up to five nitrogen atoms and up to one sulphur atom in
   assigning formulas to mass peaks. More than 50 \% multiple-formula
   assignments were found for peaks with masses > 650 Da. Based on DBE
   -aEuro parts per thousand O frequency diagrams, many CHO, CHOS1, CHON1
   and CHON1S1 molecular series were ultimately assigned to many m/z and
   considered to be reliable solutions. The unequivocal data pool could
   thus be enlarged by 523 (6.8 \%) CHOS1 components. In contrast to the
   method validation with CHO-rich SRFA, validation with sulphur-rich pit
   lake samples showed that formulas with a higher number of non-oxygen
   heteroatoms can be more reliable assignments in many cases. As an
   example: CHOS molecular series were reliable and the CHO classes were
   unreliable amongst other molecular classes in many multiple-formula
   assignments from the sulphur-rich pit lake samples.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the seasonal and interannual dynamics of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) in the Yangtze Estuary, surface and bottom water
   samples in the Yangtze Estuary and its adjacent sea were collected and
   characterized using fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) and
   parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) in both dry and wet seasons in 2012
   and 2013. Two protein-like components and three humic-like components
   were identified. Three humic-like components decreased linearly with
   increasing salinity (r>0.90, p<0.001), suggesting their distribution
   could primarily be controlled by physical mixing. By contrast, two
   protein-like components fell below the theoretical mixing line, largely
   due to microbial degradation and removal during mixing. Higher
   concentrations of humic-like components found in 2012 could be
   attributed to higher freshwater discharge relative to 2013. There was a
   lack of systematic patterns for three humic-like components between
   seasons and years, probably due to variations of other factors such as
   sources and characteristics. Highest concentrations of fluorescent
   components, observed in estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) region, could
   be attributed to sediment resuspension and subsequent release of DOM,
   supported by higher concentrations of fluorescent components in bottom
   water than in surface water at two stations where sediments probably
   resuspended. Meanwhile, photobleaching could be reflected from the
   changes in the ratios between fluorescence intensity (Fmax) of
   humic-like components and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) absorption coefficient
   (a355) along the salinity gradient. This study demonstrates the
   abundance and composition of DOM in estuaries are controlled not only by
   hydrological conditions, but also by its sources, characteristics and
   related estuarine biogeochemical processes.}},

Title = {{Depth-dependent photodegradation of marine dissolved organic matter}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface and deep waters of the
   eastern Atlantic Ocean and Sargasso Sea was analyzed by excitation
   emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor
   analysis (PARAFAC). Photo-degradation with semi-continuous monitoring of
   EEMs and absorbance spectra was used to measure the photo-degradation
   kinetics and changes of the PARAFAC components in a depth profile of DOM
   at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) station in the Sargasso Sea.
   A five component model was fit to the EEMs, which included traditional
   terrestrial-like, marine-like, and protein-like components.
   Terrestrial-like components showed the expected high photo-reactivity,
   but surprisingly, the traditional marine-like peak showed slight
   photo-production in surface waters, which may account for its prevalence
   in marine systems. Surface waters were depleted in photo-labile
   components while protein-like fluorescent components were enriched,
   consistent with previous studies. Ultra-high resolution mass
   spectrometry detected unique aliphatic compounds in the surface waters
   at the BATS site, which may be photo-produced or photo-stable. Principle
   component and canonical analysis showed strong correlations between
   relative contributions of unsaturated/aromatic molecular formulas and
   depth, with aliphatic compounds more prevalent in surface waters and
   aromatic compounds in deep waters. Strong correlations were seen between
   these aromatic compounds and humic-like fluorescent components. The
   rapid photo-degradation of the deep-sea fluorescent DOM in addition to
   the surface water relative depletion of aromatic compounds suggests that
   deep-sea fluorescent DOM may be too photochemically labile to survive
   during overturning circulation.}},

Abstract = {{A harmonic analysis of three years of data collected with fortnight to
   monthly frequency in the oligotrophic Bay of Blanes (NW Mediterranean)
   revealed that the water column mixing-stratification cycle dictated the
   seasonal build-up of the bulk and different coloured fractions of
   dissolved organic matter (DOM). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   accumulated at late summer, reaching the annual maximum by early
   September, half a month later than water temperature. The seasonal cycle
   of the protein-like fluorescence (F(280/350)) was in phase with DOC,
   suggesting that reduced heterotrophic activity, due to severe P
   limitation, is likely the reason behind the late summer accumulation of
   these materials. The absorption due to conjugated carbon double bonds of
   DOM (a(CDOM)(254)) reached the annual maximum by early August,
   concomitant to the seasonal maximum of microbial activity, suggesting
   that biological production prevailed over photo-degradation of these
   compounds. On the contrary, the fluorescence of humic-like substances
   absorbing in the UV-A region (F(340/440)) presented the annual maximum
   in early February, coinciding with the seasonal maximum of autotrophic
   biomass, and the minimum in early August, because of the prevalence of
   photo-degradation over microbial production. The optical properties of
   DOM allowed distinguishing between three DOC pools of contrasting
   origin, photo- and bio-reactivity, in the oligotrophic NW Mediterranean
   Sea. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the bacterial decomposition of humic acids (HA) in two
   flow-through culture experiments, one inoculated by marine and one by
   estuarine bacterial communities. In both experiments, the cultures were
   fed with HA media of salinities of 28 and 14, close to their ambient and
   a distinctly different, foreign salinity. HA were decomposed to >similar
   to 60\% of the initial concentration within 70 similar to days, and the
   foreign salinity yielded the highest decomposition. A detrended
   correspondence analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   (DGGE) banding patterns showed that during incubation, the bacterial
   community composition underwent distinct changes. A phylogenetic
   analysis of DGGE bands excised and bacteria isolated at the end on HA as
   the sole carbon source showed that Alphaproteobacteria and
   Gammaproteobacteria largely dominated the communities in the marine
   flow-through cultures, whereas Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and
   Alphaproteobacteria dominated the estuarine communities. Eleven of 13
   isolates obtained from both experiments were able to grow on HA as the
   sole carbon source, seven on phenol and three, affiliated to the
   Roseobacter clade, on various aromatic acids. The bacteria retrieved
   from the flow-through cultures were closely (9699\%) affiliated to
   organisms capable of degrading humic matter, aromatic and aliphatic
   compounds and also to other bacteria reported previously from the Wadden
   Sea and Weser estuary.}},

Abstract = {{Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (AAPB) are unique players in
   carbon cycling in the ocean. Cellular carbon storage is an important
   mechanism regulating the nutrition status of AAPB but is not yet well
   understood. In this paper, six AAPB species (Dinoroseobacter sp. JL1447,
   Roseobacter denitrificans OCh 114, Roseobacter litoralis OCh 149,
   Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12T, Labrenzia alexandrii DFL 11T, and
   Erythrobacter longus DSMZ 6997) were examined, and all of them
   demonstrated the ability to form the carbon polymer polyhydroxyalkanoate
   (PHA) in the cell. The PHA in Dinoroseobacter sp. JL1447 was identified
   as poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) according to evidence from Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and
   H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy examinations. Carbon sources
   turned out to be critical for PHA production in AAPB. Among the eight
   media tested with Dinoroseobacter sp. JL1447, sodium acetate, giving a
   PHA production rate of 72\%, was the most productive carbon source,
   followed by glucose, with a 68\% PHA production rate. Such PHA
   production rates are among the highest recorded for all bacteria. The
   C/N ratio of substrates was verified by the experiments as another key
   factor in PHA production. In the case of R. denitrificans OCh 114, PHA
   was not detected when the organism was cultured at C/N ratios of <2 but
   became apparent at C/N ratios of >3. Light is also important for the
   formation of PHA in AAPB. In the case of Dinoroseobacter sp. JL1447, up
   to a one-quarter increase in PHB production was observed when the
   culture underwent growth in a light-dark cycle compared to growth
   completely in the dark.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, tangential-flow ultrafiltration (UF) technology has
   become a primary tool for isolating large amounts of ``ultrafiltered{''}
   marine dissolved organic carbon (UDOC; 0.1 mu m to similar to 1 nm) for
   the detailed characterization of DOC chemical composition and
   radiocarbon (Delta C-14) signatures. However, while total DOC
   Delta(14)Cvalues are generally thought to be quite similar in the world
   ocean, previous studies have reported widely different Delta C-14 values
   for UDOC, even from very similar ocean regions, raising questions about
   the relative ``reactivity{''} of high molecular weight (HMW) DOC.
   Specifically, to what degree do variations in DOM molecular weight (MW)
   vs. composition alter its relative persistence, and therefore HMW DOC
   Delta C-14 values?
   In this study we evaluate the effects of varying proportions of HMW vs.
   low molecular weight (LMW) DOC on UDOC Delta C-14 values. Using
   concentration factor (CF) as a proxy for MW distributions, we modeled
   the retention of both OC and Delta C-14 in several very large CF
   experiments (CF >3000), from three depths (20, 670, and 915 m) in the
   North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). The resulting DOC and Delta C-14
   UF permeation coefficients generally increase with depth, consistent
   with mass balance trends, indicating very significant permeation of LMW,
   C-14-depleted DOC at depth, and higher recoveries of Delta
   C-14-enriched, HMW DOC in the surface. In addition, changes in CF during
   sample concentration and ionic strength during sample diafiltration had
   very large and predictable impacts on UDOC Delta C-14 values.
   Together these results suggest that previously reported disparities in
   UDOC Delta C-14 values are reconciled by linked trends of Delta C-14
   content vs. MW. At low CFs, UDOC samples have similar Delta C-14 values
   to total DOC. In contrast, UDOC samples collected at extremely high CFs
   (and after diafiltration) have more positive Delta C-14 values. We
   demonstrate that the observed relationships between UDOC Delta C-14 and
   CF derived from our data can directly explain offsets in all previously
   published UDOC Delta C-14 values for the NPSG. While CF is not
   traditionally considered in UF studies, our results indicate it can
   substantially influence the interpretation of UDOC C-14 ``age{''}, and
   thus reactivity, in the marine environment. In addition, our results
   indicate that CF can in fact be used as a proxy for average MW. We
   suggest that a variable-CF-UF approach, coupled with molecular-level
   Delta C-14 analyses, presents a new tool for studying relationships
   between molecular size, age, and ``labile{''} DOC distributions in the
   ocean. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Arctic Ocean is a potentially important sink for atmospheric carbon
   dioxide (CO2) With a recent estimate suggesting that the region
   Contributes from 5 to 14\% of the global ocean's net uptake of CO2. In
   the western Arctic, Ocean, the focus of this paper the Chukchir Sea is a
   Ocean sink for CO2 compensated for by outgassing of CO2 from the East
   Siberian Sea shelf. The Arctic marine carbon cycle and exchange of CO2
   between the ocean and atmosphere appear particularly sensitive to
   environmental changes, including sea ice loss, warming, changes in
   seasonal marine phytoplankton primary production, changes in ocean
   circulation and freshwater inputs, and even the impacts of ocean
   acidification. In the near term, further sea ice loss, increases in
   phytoplankton growth rates, and other environmental and physical changes
   in the Arctic are expected to cause a limited net increase in the uptake
   of CO2 by Arctic surface waters. Recent studies suggest that this
   enhanced uptake will be short lived, with surface waters rapidly warming
   and equilibrating with the atmosphere. Furthermore, release of large
   stores of carbon from the surrounding Arctic landmasses through rivers
   into the Arctic Ocean and further warming over the next century may
   alter the Arctic from a CO2 sink to a source over the next century.}},

Abstract = {{Potential of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to degrade via indirect
   photolysis in aquatic solution under conditions representing surface
   water was studied. Globally distributed and bioaccumulative PFOA does
   not absorb solar radiation by itself, but may be potentially
   photochemically transformed by the natural sensitizers such as dissolved
   organic matter (DOM), nitrate or ferric iron. Reaction solutions
   containing purified water, fulvic acid ( representing DOM), nitrate,
   ferric iron or sea water from the Baltic Sea were spiked with PFOA and
   irradiated with an artificial sun (290-800 nm). In comparison similar
   samples were also irradiated under UV radiation at 254 nm in order to
   study the direct photolysis. UV radiation at 254 nm decomposed PFOA to
   perfluoroheptanoic-, perfluorohexanoic- and perfluoropentanoic acids.
   The samples irradiated with an artificial sun contained no decomposition
   products and no decrease in PFOA concentration was observed. According
   to the detection limit of the products and typical solar radiation at
   the surface of ocean, the photochemical half-life for PFOA was estimated
   to be at least 256 years at the depth of 0 m, >5000 years in the mixing
   layer of open ocean and >25,000 years in coastal ocean. This is
   significantly more than the previously reported photochemical half-life
   of PFOA (>0.96 years). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Examining the coupling of carbon and nitrogen cycles in Appalachian
   streams: the role of dissolved organic nitrogen}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{720-732}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Although regional and global models of nitrogen (N) cycling typically
   focus on nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is the dominant form
   of nitrogen export from many watersheds and thus the dominant form of
   dissolved N in many streams. Our understanding of the processes
   controlling DON export from temperate forests is poor. In pristine
   systems, where biological N limitation is common, N contained in
   recalcitrant organic matter (OM) can dominate watershed N losses. This
   recalcitrant OM often has moderately constrained carbon : nitrogen (C:N)
   molar ratios (similar to 25-55) and therefore, greater DON losses should
   be observed in sites where there is greater total dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) loss. In regions where anthropogenic N pollution is high,
   it has been suggested that increased inorganic N availability can reduce
   biological demand for organic N and therefore increase watershed DON
   losses. This would result in a positive correlation between inorganic
   and organic N concentrations across sites with varying N availability.
   In four repeated synoptic surveys of stream water chemistry from
   forested watersheds along an N loading gradient in the southern
   Appalachians, we found surprisingly little correlation between DON and
   DOC concentrations. Further, we found that DON concentrations were
   always significantly correlated with watershed N loading and stream
   water {[}NO3-] but that the direction of this relationship was negative
   in three of the four surveys. The C:N molar ratio of dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) in streams draining watersheds with high N deposition was
   very high relative to other freshwaters. This finding, together with
   results from bioavailability assays in which we directly manipulated C
   and N availabilities, suggests that heterotrophic demand for labile C
   can increase as a result of dissolved inorganic N (DIN) loading, and
   that heterotrophs can preferentially remove N-rich molecules from DOM.
   These results are inconsistent with the two prevailing hypotheses that
   dominate interpretations of watershed DON loss. Therefore, we propose a
   new hypothesis, the indirect carbon control hypothesis, which recognizes
   that heterotrophic demand for N-rich DOM can keep stream water DON
   concentrations low when N is not limiting and heterotrophic demand for
   labile C is high.}},

   bacteria}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{191-199}},
Abstract = {{The surfaces of kelp are covered with bacteria that may utilize
   kelp-produced carbon and thereby contribute significantly to the carbon
   flux in kelp forest ecosystems. There is scant knowledge about the
   identity of these bacteria and about which kelp-derived carbon sources
   they utilize. An enrichment approach, using kelp constituent carbon
   sources for bacterial cultivation, was used to identify bacterial
   populations associated with the kelp Laminaria hyperborea that degrade
   kelp components. In order to assess whether the cultured bacteria are
   significant under natural conditions, partial 16 rRNA gene sequences
   from the cultured bacteria were compared to sequences obtained from the
   indigenous bacterial communities inhabiting natural kelp surface
   biofilms. The results identify different members of the Roseobacter
   clade of Alphaproteobacteria in addition to members of
   Gammaproteobacteria that are involved in kelp constituent degradation.
   These bacteria are observed sporadically on natural kelp surfaces and
   may represent opportunistic bacteria important in degradation of dead
   kelp material. Many of the cultured bacteria appear to be generalists
   that are able to utilize different kelp carbon sources. This study is
   the first to link culturable kelp-associated bacteria with their
   occurrence and possible roles in the natural environment.}},

Abstract = {{Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), phytoplankton pigments, and
   inherent optical properties were analyzed in sea surface microlayer
   (SSM), near-surface (0-2 m), and subsurface (0-110 m) samples from
   stations off the Iberian Peninsula in June-July 2005. During a visible
   surface slick, MAA concentrations reached 290 mu g L-1 in the SSM, which
   correlated with an increase in abundance of the dinoflagellate,
   Prorocentrum micans (>4000 cells mL(-1)) and covaried with low Ekman
   transport. High levels of colored dissolved organic material (CDOM) were
   also found in the SSM, and a prominent absorption shoulder between 300
   and 340 nm was evident in the CDOM absorption spectra, indicative of
   MAAs in the dissolved fraction. Low CDOM slope ratios (S-CDOM(275-295) :
   (350-400)) during the development of the surface slick suggest microbial
   production of CDOM, possibly exuded from the sudden proliferation in P.
   micans. In the absence of a well-defined SSM, higher S-CDOM(275-295) :
   (350-400) ratios were found, suggesting photobleaching of CDOM at the
   surface. The particulate absorption spectra of MAAs (a(PMAA)(lambda))
   were effective at absorbing ultraviolet (UV) radiation in a narrow
   spectral band between 310 and 350 nm. Since a(CDOM)(lambda) exhibits an
   exponential rise in absorption in the UV and was high in the SSM and the
   subsurface compared with a(PMAA)(lambda), CDOM would be the principal
   mechanism of UVA and B attenuation in the water column, providing an
   additional sunscreen to phytoplankton.}},

   thousand: delta O-18 and delta C-13 values for calcite are generally
   lower than those for coexisting dolomite, indicating diagenetic
   alteration. In contrast, the carbonate in the Upper Unit has delta O-18
   values of -25.6 to - 18.6\%. and delta C-13 values of - 11.7 to - 7.8
   parts per thousand; the sedimentary isotopic records in this unit are
   considered near-primary because of a lack of correlation between the
   delta O-18, delta C-13 values and the dolomite-calcite fractionation.
   The unusually low delta O-18 values of - 25.6 to - 18.6 parts per
   thousand for carbonate in the Upper Unit are comparable to those for
   modern Arctic carbonates. corresponding to water delta O-18 values as
   low as -27 to -20 parts per thousand during deposition. This carbonate
   is interpreted as having formed from the continental deglacial meltwater
   in a continental marginal basin. In contrast, the carbonate with the
   higher delta O-18 values of - 14.8 to - 3.9 parts per thousand for the
   carbonate in the Lower Unit is interpreted to have formed from the
   fluids mainly comprised water from global marine deglaciation. These
   interpretations are strengthened by previously presented terrigenous REE
   + Y patterns and high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios for the both units of the
   Lantian Formation carbonates. Therefore, the unusually low delta O-18
   meltwater is explained by regional continental deglaciation. This
   deglaciation process predates the appearance of mid-Ediacaran biota but
   postdates the Gaskiers/Moelv ice age. Decomposition of dissolved organic
   carbon in freshwater is considered as a likely cause for the low delta
   C-13 values in the Upper Unit, whereas the high delta C-13 for carbonate
   in the Lower Unit would be derived from the oxidation of methane hydrate
   in the post-Marincian phase. The temporal correlation between the
   extreme O-18 depletion and the paleobiological evolution suggests that
   continental deglaciation may have contributed to oxidation of the
   mid-Ediacaran seawater. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria play a key role in the world's oceans, supporting nutrient
   remineralisation and mediating carbon transfer. Little is known about
   annual changes in bacterial concentration, production and metabolism
   during the extreme seasonal changes in biological productivity in
   Antarctic waters. We measured rates of bacterial production,
   concentrations of viruses and bacteria and environmental parameters
   between February 2004 and January 2005 at an Antarctic coastal site.
   Concentrations of total bacteria and viruses were obtained using 4',
   6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes),
   respectively. Populations of bacteria in different metabolic states were
   estimated using vital stains. Concentrations of bacteria with intact or
   compromised plasma membranes were estimated using BacLight (Molecular
   Probes) and active cells estimated using 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate
   (6CFDA). Our study showed 6CFDA and BacLight gave rapid and ecologically
   valuable insights into bacterial physiology, production and growth in
   natural Antarctic communities that were poorly represented by changes in
   total cell concentrations. Concentrations of total, active and intact
   bacteria declined rapidly at the end of summer probably owing to viral
   infection and microheterotrophic grazing. The decline continued over
   winter, likely owing to substrate limitation, and concentrations only
   increased after the phytoplankton bloom in spring and summer. Bacterial
   abundance was positively correlated with particulate organic carbon
   (POC) and nitrogen (PON), but not dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   reflecting the refractory nature of the DOC pool. Only active and intact
   bacteria were significantly correlated with concentrations of chl a and
   rates of bacterial production. Furthermore, the obtained rates of
   {[}H-3]thymidine uptake suggest that bacterial growth rates can be
   sustained by the populations identified as intact or by active cells
   alone.}},

Abstract = {{We used a wave tank to study the influence of pore-water flow and
   diffusive transport on the degradation of labile particular organic
   matter (POM: Ulva lactuca pieces) embedded in permeable sediment.
   Pore-water advection, induced by the interaction of the wave-driven
   oscillatory boundary flow and stationary sediment ripples, reproducibly
   exposed POM buried in the top 2 cm of the sediment to oxic or anoxic
   conditions lasting between days and weeks. Planar oxygen optodes
   together with carbon and nitrogen analyses were used to visualize and
   quantify the degradation rates. Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) were up
   to 18-times higher at locations of the buried POM compared to the
   surrounding sediment. Elevated OCR were also detected downstream the POM
   locations. Despite high permeability of the sediment and exposure to
   oxygenated pore-water flows, suboxic and anoxic sites and suboxic
   pore-water ``plumes{''} developed at and downstream of the locations of
   POM in otherwise oxygenated C, sediment regions. The carbon loss of the
   buried U. lactuca discs derived from the OCR measurements was only
   4-15\% of that measured by the carbon analysis of the recovered pieces,
   suggesting that the bacterial degradation of POM and the final
   degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were spatially decoupled
   by the pore-water flow. Advection can thus enhance the rate of organic
   matter degradation by efficiently distributing DOM from the
   ``hotspots{''} of organic matter mineralization to larger volumes of
   permeable sediments and associated microbial communities.}},

Title = {{Concentration, production and turnover of viruses and dissolved DNA
   pools at Stn ALOHA, North Pacific Subtropical Gyre}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{The concentrations,. production rates and turnover times of the
   components of the dissolved DNA (D-DNA) pool, including viruses, were
   investigated in a depth profile at Stn ALOHA in the North Pacific
   Subtropical Gyre. A recently developed centrifugal concentration method
   was used to quantify the 3 major components of the D-DNA pool: free or
   enzymatically-hydrolyzable D-DNA (ehD-DNA), D-DNA within viruses and
   uncharacterized bound D-DNA. The production rates of each of these
   components of the D-DNA pool were estimated using a dilution technique
   and the turnover times of each component were calculated. Concentrations
   of total D-DNA and ehD-DNA were approximately 1.2 and 0.6 ng ml(-1),
   respectively, throughout the mixed layer (upper 100 m), and decreased
   with increasing depth to 0.2 and 0.06 ng ml(-1) at 500 m, resulting in
   ehD-DNA constituting 27 to 51\% of the total D-DNA pool. Concentrations
   of viruses ranged from 0.9 to 1.0 x 10(7) ml(-1) within the mixed layer
   and also decreased with increasing depth to 0.2 x 10(7) ml-1 at 500 m.
   The average mass of DNA per viral genome was estimated at each depth
   with viral genome fingerprinting, and ranged from 62.5 to 69.8 ag DNA
   per virus. Multiplying the concentration of viruses by the average mass
   of DNA per virus at each depth revealed the concentration of D-DNA
   within viruses, which ranged from 0.13 to 0.68 ng ml(-1) and constituted
   49 to 63 \% of the total D-DNA pool. There was no measurable
   concentration of uncharacterized bound D-DNA in the depth profile. The
   production rates of ehD-DNA and D-DNA within viruses ranged from 0.10 to
   0.41 and 0.03 to 0.07 ng ml(-1) h(-1), respectively, within the mixed
   layer, but no production of D-DNA could be measured below the mixed
   layer. The calculated turnover times of ehD-DNA ranged from 0.97 to 6.2
   h within the mixed layer and were 3 to 10 times shorter than the
   turnover times of D-DNA within viruses, which ranged from 9.6 to 24 h.
   In addition, the amount of phosphorus that was calculated to be produced
   within the ehD-DNA was able to support the biologically available
   phosphorus (BAP) demand, based on previously reported measurements of
   BAP uptake at Stn ALOHA. Using the measured virus production rates,
   viruses were estimated to lyse 3.2 to 16.5 \% of the standing stock of
   bacteria at Stn ALOHA h(-1), resulting in the release of ehD-DNA, which
   was estimated as 11 to 35\% of the total ehD-DNA production. This
   research supports the hypothesis that individual components of the D-DNA
   pool are cycled at different rates and shows that viruses in open-ocean
   gyre systems may have large impacts on the microbial community there,
   including viral-induced mortality and subsequent release of cellular
   contents to the dissolved organic matter pool.}},

Title = {{Distribution of hydrogen peroxide in the northwest Pacific Ocean}},
Journal = {{GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a reactive oxygen intermediate
   involved in the cycling of metals and dissolved organic matter. Because
   little is known of its distribution in the North Pacific Ocean, we
   determined H2O2 in surface waters continuously and obtained vertical
   profiles at nine stations during a cruise from Japan to Hawaii. Surface
   water H2O2 varied from less than 10 to more than 250 nmol dm(-3). A diel
   cycle in surface water H2O2 (similar to 25 nmol dm(-3)) was observed
   only on one day during the monthlong cruise. This is contrary to
   expectations based on the usual assumption of photo-production as the
   dominant input of H2O2. Experiments were also conducted during the
   cruise to examine both photo-production and dark decay. The net rate of
   photo-production at a station near Hawaii was determined to be 8 nmol
   dm(-3) h(-1), similar to rates reported for the central Atlantic Ocean
   and Antarctic. However, this maximum estimate of photo-production is
   also similar to probable rates of H2O2 input by other mechanisms (
   biological production and rain). The pseudo-first-order rate constant
   for dark decay varied from 0.1 to 0.2 d(-1), which is toward the low end
   of previous reports of H2O2 decay rates, and was observed to increase
   proportionately to the dissolved organic carbon concentration. Taken
   together, these results suggest that photo-production of H2O2 in open
   ocean waters may be less important than previously thought and therefore
   H2O2 is likely less of an indicator of the photo-chemical reactivity of
   surface waters than hoped for. Furthermore, we observed that the H2O2
   inventory for the upper 200 m of the water column has a maximum at
   midlatitudes. We suggest that this results from diminished inputs at
   high latitude as well as increased decay rates at low latitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved and particulate nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) concentrations
   were measured in the upper 1000 m of the water column during 3 summer
   and 3 winter months at Stn ALOHA (22.75 degrees N, 158 degrees W) in the
   oligotrophic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. In the euphotic zone (0 to
   175 m) particulate adenosine-5'-triphosphate (P-ATP) and dissolved ATP
   (D-ATP) concentrations were positively correlated in summer (0 to 175 m;
   r(2) = 0.61, p < 0.001, n = 24), but not in winter (r(2) = 0.02, n =
   24). D-ATP comprised > 65 \% of the total ATP (T-ATP) pool in the
   summer, and similar to 50\% in winter. Dissolved
   guanosine-5'-triphosphate (D-GTP) inventories were 5- to 6-fold greater
   in July and August than those observed in mid-June (1.1 +/- 0.1 vs. 8.0
   +/- 0.6 and 6.5 +/- 0.3 mu mol D-GTP m(-2), respectively) and winter
   concentrations were on average lower than the mean summer
   concentrations. The particulate GTP (P-GTP) inventories were almost
   twice those measured in winter (mean 1.1 +/- 0.4 in summer vs. 0.6 +/-
   0.1 mu mol P-GTP m(-2) in winter, n = 3). These results are consistent
   with higher microbial growth rates in summer. Uptake of D-ATP showed
   multi-phasic kinetic patterns. The half-saturation constants (K(t))
   ranged from 1 to 26 nM at D-ATP concentrations of 0.2 to 30 nM, and
   V(max) ranged from 0.3 to 1.4 nM d(-1). At concentrations > 30 nM, K(t)
   exceeded 100 nM and V(max) was 10.4 nM d(-1). The calculated net
   production rates of D-ATP ranged from 40 to 150 pM d(-1), and the
   turnover time of the ambient D-ATP pool was estimated to be 1 to 2 d.
   The P flux through the D-ATP pool could potentially be 5 times faster
   than that of the bulk DOP pool, implying that P derived from nucleotides
   may be an important pathway in the P cycle of oligotrophic oceans.}},

Abstract = {{Light is a source of both energy and information for the biota. The
   spatial, temporal and spectral variability of light experienced by
   marine phytoplankton differs significantly from that experienced by
   terrestrial plants, due to the selective attenuation of solar irradiance
   in the aquatic medium. In the present study we analysed such variability
   and focused, in particular, on those bands within the spectrum that may
   act as potential signals for physiological responses. Our results
   demonstrate that the spectral variation of the light field carries
   information on the time of day, the vertical position and the presence
   of very close neighbours, also underwater. This is consistent with the
   recent findings of a widespread occurrence of photoreceptors in marine
   algae. We show also that red photoreceptors, whose presence in marine
   algae was difficult to reconcile with the strong attenuation of long
   wavelengths by water, may be triggered at depth by the red light
   generated by transpectral processes.}},

Abstract = {{Through a series of comparative experiments the relative effects of
   copper (Cu) exposure on the growth and physiology (chlorophyll
   fluorescence, ion leakage, 02 evolution and pigmentation) of the red
   seaweed Gracilariopsis longissima was investigated. Of the various
   physiological end-points measured, growth proved to be the most
   sensitive with reductions in relative growth rate (RGR) observed at a
   concentration of 12.5 mug l(-1) Cu, with zero growth above about 300 mug
   l(-1). A significant increase in ion leakage and reduction in
   phycobiliprotein concentrations were evident, but only at the highest
   concentration tested (500 mug l(-1)), at which point shrinkage of apical
   tips also occurred. Photosynthetic rates, as measured by chlorophyll
   fluorescence and oxygen evolution, were first impaired at 250 mug l(-1),
   with a 30\% reduction in photosynthetic efficiency (F(v)/F(m)) and a
   60\% reduction in oxygen evolution. There were no discernible effects on
   respiration rates or chlorophyll a and beta-carotene content over this
   concentration range. It was hypothesised that the observed uncoupling of
   growth and photosynthesis at low Cu concentrations might be explained by
   the release of dissolved organic matter (DOC), resulting in less
   available energy for growth. No such increase in DOC was apparent.
   Alternative explanations to account for the uncoupling, including the
   diversion of energy for maintenance of cell integrity and induction of
   protective mechanisms, are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Using a novel multi-cell continuous flow assembly, we studied the
   dynamic interactions between high-molecular weight substrate
   consumption, fermentation, and terminal metabolism by microbial
   communities in anaerobic marine sediments. This system allowed partial
   physical separation of individual steps in the remineralization of
   high-molecular weight organic matter: degradation of high-moleclular
   weight polysaccharides, net formation of volatile fatty acids, and net
   sulfate reduction. Time series experiments yielded insight into time
   scales of extracellular enzyme production as well as the onset of
   terminal metabolism. These data also allowed us to assess the rate
   dependence of individual steps in organic carbon degradation. The major
   accumulated product of hydrolysis and fermentation was acetate, followed
   by lactate and formate. The rate of the initial exoenzymatic hydrolysis
   of polysaccharides was an order of magnitude faster than fermentation
   and sulfate reduction rates, and suggested a scenario whereby dissolved
   organic carbon could at least temporarily accumulate in pore waters. The
   lag in the consumption of hydrolyzed products by sulfate-reducing
   bacteria may reflect the differential response of the microbial
   community to increased substrate availability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The elemental and isotopic composition of particulate and dissolved
   organic matter was investigated in the Piracicaba River basin, Sao Paulo
   State, Brazil. Comparison of riverine organic matter from the Piracicaba
   River basin, a region where rivers and streams receive urban sewage and
   industrial effluents, with data reported for the pristine Amazon system
   revealed significant differences associated with anthropogenic impacts.
   One important difference was N enrichment in the particulate organic
   material of the Piracicaba basin rivers, due to (a) urban and industrial
   effluents, and (b) enhanced phytoplankton growth, which results from the
   combination of nutrient enrichment and damming of sections of the
   rivers. Radiocarbon concentrations were overall more depleted (older
   C-14 age) in the Piracicaba basin rivers than in the Amazon, which may
   reflect the importance of soil erosion in the former. Analyses of stable
   and radioactive carbon isotopes and lignin-derived compounds indicated
   that coarse particulate organic material is composed of a mixture of
   soil particles and degraded organic matter from C3 and C4 vascular
   plants. Fine particulate organic material was composed mainly of soil
   particles and phytoplankton cell remains, the latter especially during
   low water, Ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter was the most degraded
   fraction according to its lignin oxidation products, and showed the
   greatest influence of C4 plant sources. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The bacterial utilization of organic matter was investigated during two
   cruises made in the north-western Black Sea in the summer of 1995 and in
   the winter-spring transition period (April-May 1997). Bacterial biomass
   and activities (enzymatic activity and production) as well as direct
   (dissolved and particulate organic carbon) and indirect (primary
   production) sources of organic carbon for bacteria were measured along
   high resolution salinity gradients and a spatial grid in the
   Danube-Black Sea mixing zone and in the Black Sea marine waters. Despite
   little change in bacterial biomass, bacterial activity displayed
   significant spatio-temporal variations. Bacterial production was maximal
   in the Danube-Black Sea mixing zone in July 1995. In this area, the
   source of organic matter for heterotrophic bacteria can be derived from
   autochtonous production and/or from allochtonous inputs. Total potential
   organic carbon sources were always higher in the Danube-Black Sea mixing
   zone than in the Black Sea marine waters, particularly due to high
   primary production and particulate organic carbon concentrations
   recorded in this mixing zone. Interestingly, dissolved organic carbon
   concentrations along the salinity gradients were uniform. A seasonal
   constant accumulation of DOC was, however, observed in the whole area
   investigated from 2000 mgC m(-3) in April 1997 to 3000 mgC m(-3) in July
   1995. The relative contribution of the various sources of organic carbon
   to the bacterial carbon demand was analysed. In April 1997, the
   bacterial carbon demand could be satisfied only by the allochtonous
   sources of organic matter discharged by the Danube. In May 1997, the
   contribution of autochtonous phytoplankton-derived organic carbon was
   expected to increase due to the general enhancement of biological
   activity. In July 1995, direct sources of organic carbon were barely
   enough to satisfy the bacterial needs. The excess of dissolved organic
   carbon accumulated during the winter-spring period is assumed to support
   the high bacterial carbon demand of summer. Indirect evidence suggests
   that this delayed utilization of dissolved organic matter could be due
   to PO4 limitation of bacterial growth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of this study was to assess the hydrogen peroxide (HP)
   production rates (HPPR) related to anthropogenic pollution in coastal
   waters by laboratory and field experiments. HPPR's were assessed by
   simultaneous measurements of HP concentrations, cumulative solar UV
   irradiation and dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence in the
   seawater samples at clean and polluted sites in the Mediterranean, Red
   and the Baltic Seas. The natural HP concentrations at all sites
   (8-100nM) fall within the normal range recorded elsewhere, and follows a
   diurnal pattern. The polluted stations in the Mediterranean and Baltic
   Seas showed higher HPPR (3.2-16.6 nM m(2) W-1 h(-1)) than the clean
   stations, while in the Red Sea no significant differences were found
   because the station that was considered a priori polluted was actually
   rather clean (2-3 nM m(2) W-1 h(-1)). Laboratory experiments
   demonstrated that HPPR was positively linearly correlated to DOM
   fluorescence, however, this relationship was not found in the natural
   seawater samples examined in the held. The lack of relationship between
   HPPR and DOM in the field was attributed to enzymatic breakdown of KP as
   observed in dark decay experiments. HP dark decay rates were highest in
   polluted stations, probably due to larger bacterioplankton populations
   in these samples. Moreover, the HP dark decay rates were much lower in
   filtered than in non-filtered samples. Sun incubation of filtered (0.2
   mu m) seawater samples were performed to assess whether elimination of
   particles would yield higher HPPRs than in non-filtered samples. In the
   Baltic;Sea (low UV irradiation) HPPR was higher in the filtered samples,
   while at sites with relatively high UV irradiation (Mediterranean and
   Red Seas), filtration of seawater did not stimulate HPPRs, probably due
   to UV-damage to planktonic microorganisms. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that the ocean is an important source for
   atmospheric CS2, which makes a major contribution to the formation of
   COS in the atmosphere. The processes producing CS2 in seawater, however,
   are essentially unknown. We report for the first time to our knowledge
   that marine photochemical reactions are identified as a significant
   source for oceanic CS2. Apparent quantum yield spectra of CS2 production
   were obtained using water samples collected in the northeast Atlantic.
   Results indicate that it is mainly UV solar radiation (290-340 nm) which
   is responsible for CS2 photoproduction. The photoproduction rate of CS2
   is positively correlated with absorbance at 350 nm, suggesting that the
   reactions are mediated by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM).
   Laboratory irradiations have confirmed that cysteine and cystine are
   efficient precursors of CS2 and that OH radicals are likely to be
   important intermediates. Both the field survey and laboratory work point
   to similar mechanisms for photochemical production of CS2 and COS in
   marine waters. A CS2 production rate of 0.49 Tg yr for the world oceans
   has been estimated using the quantum yield spectra from this work and
   the sea surface light field provided by Leifer {[}1988]. This estimate
   is of the same order of magnitude as the present estimate of the CS2
   flux from the ocean to the atmosphere based on surface saturation and
   wind speed.}},

Abstract = {{Total dissolvable iron (TDFe), particulate iron (PFe) and hydrogen

   upper 250 m in the Southern Ocean (62 degrees 00E/66 degrees 42S-49
   degrees 00S, ANTARES II cruise, February 1994). TDFe was organically
   extracted (APDC/DDDC-chloroform) and analysed by Graphite Furnace Atomic
   Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS), PFe was analysed by GFAAS following a
   strong mixed-acid leach, and H2O2 was analysed on board by fluorometry.
   The respective detection limits are equal to 0.13 nmol/kg, 0.02 nmol/kg,
   and 3.0 nmol/kg. TDFe concentrations vary from 0.4 to 6.2 nmol/kg and
   profiles are not completely depleted in the surface. PFe concentrations
   vary from 0.02 to 0.2 nmol/kg. Iron/carbon (Fe/C) uptake ratios for
   phytoplankton;ton were calculated either from seawater or particle
   measurements. They are variable along the transect but are consistent
   when they could be compared. All the observed ratios an within the range
   of values proposed for the Fe/C uptake ratios by phytoplankton. Using
   our uptake ratio calculated in the Permanent Open Ocean Zone (4.10(-6)
   mol/mol). we estimate that the primary production which can be supported
   by the iron input flux into the surface waters is two times higher than
   the measured primary production in the same area. In the surface waters,
   H2O2 concentrations vary from 5.0 to 19.7 nmol/kg. Such low
   concentrations are due to strong vertical mixing, low dissolved organic
   matter concentrations and the latitude of the site.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between marine microorganisms may determine the dynamics of
   microbial communities. Here, we show that two strains of the globally
   abundant marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, MED4 and MIT9313, which
   belong to two different ecotypes, differ markedly in their response to
   co-culture with a marine heterotrophic bacterium, Alteromonas macleodii
   strain HOT1A3. HOT1A3 enhanced the growth of MIT9313 at low cell
   densities, yet inhibited it at a higher concentration, whereas it had no
   effect on MED4 growth. The early transcriptomic responses of
   Prochlorococcus cells after 20 h in co-culture showed no evidence of
   nutrient starvation, whereas the expression of genes involved in
   photosynthesis, protein synthesis and stress responses typically
   decreased in MED4 and increased in MIT313. Differential expression of
   genes involved in outer membrane modification, efflux transporters and,
   in MIT9313, lanthipeptides (prochlorosins) suggests that Prochlorococcus
   mount a specific response to the presence of the heterotroph in the
   cultures. Intriguingly, many of the differentially-expressed genes
   encoded short proteins, including two new families of co-culture
   responsive genes: CCRG-1, which is found across the Prochlorococcus
   lineage and CCRG-2, which contains a sequence motif involved in the
   export of prochlorosins and other bacteriocin-like peptides, and are
   indeed released from the cells into the media.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
   spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) has proven to be a powerful technique
   revealing complexity and diversity of natural DOM molecules, but its
   application to DOM analysis in grazing-impacted agricultural systems
   remains scarce. In the present study, we presented a case study of using
   ESI-FTICR-MS in analyzing DOM from four headwater streams draining
   forest-or pasture-dominated watersheds in Virginia, USA. In all samples,
   most formulas were CHO compounds (71.8-87.9\%), with other molecular
   series (CHOS, CHON, CHONS, and CHOP (N, S)) accounting for only minor
   fractions. All samples were dominated by molecules falling in the
   lignin-like region (H/C = 0.7-1.5, O/C = 0.1-0.67), suggesting the
   predominance of allochthonous, terrestrial plant-derived DOM. Relative
   to the two pasture streams, DOM formulas in the two forest streams were
   more similar, based on Jaccard similarity coefficients and nonmetric
   multidimensional scaling calculated from Bray-Curtis distance. Formulas
   from the pasture streams were characterized by lower proportions of
   aromatic formulas and lower unsaturation, suggesting that the
   allochthonous versus autochthonous contributions of organic matter to
   streams were modified by pasture land use. The number of condensed
   aromatic structures (CAS) was higher for the forest streams, which is
   possibly due to the controlled burning in the forest-dominated
   watersheds and suggests that black carbon was mobilized from soils to
   streams. During 15-day biodegradation experiments, DOM from the two
   pasture streams was altered to a greater extent than DOM from the forest
   streams, with formulas with H/C and O/C ranges similar to protein (H/C =
   1.5-2.2, O/C = 0.3-0.67), lipid (H/C = 1.5-2.0, O/C = 0-0.3), and
   unsaturated hydrocarbon (H/C = 0.7-1.5, O/C = 0-0.1) being the most
   bioreactive groups. Aromatic compound formulas including CAS were
   preferentially removed during combined light+bacterial incubations,
   supporting the contention that black carbon is labile to light
   alterations. Collectively, our data demonstrate that head-water DOM
   composition contains integrative information on watershed sources and
   processes, and the application of ESI-FTICR-MS technique offers
   additional insights into compound composition and reactivity unrevealed
   by fluorescence and stable carbon isotopic measurements.}},

Title = {{Colloidal size distribution of humic- and protein-like fluorescent
   organic matter in the northern Gulf of Mexico}},
Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{164}},
Pages = {{25-37}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{The colloidal size distributions,(0.5-400 nm) of humic-like and
   protein-like fluorescent and UV-absorbing marine dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) have been determined using flow field-flow fractionation
   (FIFFF) coupled to UV-absorbance and fluorescence detectors. Surface
   seawater samples were taken monthly between November 2008 and September
   2009, from eight stations along a transect across the Mississippi Sound
   and Mississippi Bight in the northern Gulf of Mexico. DOM was also
   isolated from cultures of two phytoplankton species. The concentration
   of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the study area was largely
   controlled by river inputs, but the specific UV-absorbance and
   fluorescence index indicated that the importance of marine DOM increased
   from nearshore to offshore stations. In the seawater samples, only a
   small fraction (3-16\%) of the `humic-like' fluorescent DOM (Ex/Em
   wavelengths at 240/440 nm, 310/400 nm, 320/440 nm and 350/450 nm) was
   found in the colloidal size range (>0.5 nm), mainly associated with
   small colloids (mean hydrodynamic diameter 2-3 nm). For the
   `protein-like fluorescent DOM' (Ex/Em at 275/305 nm and 275/340 nm) a
   larger fraction (21-100\%) was found in the colloidal size range,
   including both small (2-3 nm) and larger (mean hydrodynamic diameter 6-7
   nm, -75 nm, and >400 nm) colloids. A culture of the diatom Chaetoceros
   muelleri produced mainly humic-like fluorescent DOM, while the
   fluorescent DOM produced by the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum sp. was
   mostly protein-like. In both plankton cultures, the protein-like DOM was
   largely associated with colloids around 6 nm, 12-14 nm and larger, while
   only a small fraction of humic-like DOM was found in the colloidal size
   range. After five months of starving and aging of the cultures, both the
   humic-like and protein-like DOM became increasingly associated with
   small colloids having a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 2-4 nm. We
   hypothesize that the larger (6-7 nm, 12-14 nm, -75 nm and >400 nm)
   protein-like colloids in the seawater samples and phytoplankton cultures
   were freshly produced by phytoplankton or bacteria. The smaller (2-4 nm)
   colloids in the aging phytoplankton cultures probably represented
   phytoplankton-derived organic material that had been transformed by
   microbial degradation, while the small (2-3 nm) humic-like colloids in
   the seawater samples were most likely dominated by fulvic acids from
   terrestrial sources. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The effect of surface irradiance on the absorption spectrum of
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the global ocean}},
Journal = {{DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{52-64}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The cycling pathways of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
   within marine systems must be constrained to better assess the impact of
   CDOM on surface ocean photochemistry and remote sensing of ocean color.
   Photobleaching, the loss of absorption by CDOM due to light exposure, is
   the primary sink for marine CDOM. Herein the susceptibility of CDOM to
   photobleaching by sea surface-level solar radiation was examined in 15
   samples collected from wide-ranging open ocean regimes. Samples from the
   Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Southern Oceans were irradiated over
   several days with full-spectrum light under a solar simulator at in situ
   temperature in order to measure photobleaching rate and derive an
   empirical matrix, epsilon(surf) (m(-1) mu Ein(-1)), which quantifies the
   effect of surface irradiance on the spectral absorption of CDOM.
   Irradiation responses among the ocean samples were similar within the
   ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum spanning 300-360 nm, generally
   exhibiting a decrease in the CDOM absorption coefficient (m(-1)) and
   concomitant increase in the CDOM spectral slope parameter, S (nm(-1)).
   However, an unexpected irradiation-induced increase in CDOM absorption
   between approximately 360 and 500 nm was observed for samples from
   high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) environments. This finding was
   linked to the presence of dissolved nitrate and may explain
   discrepancies in action spectra for dimethylsulfide (DMS) photobleaching
   observed between the Equatorial Pacific and Subtropical North Atlantic
   Oceans. The nitrate-to-phosphate ratio explained 27-70\% of observed
   variability in epsilon(surf) at observation wavelengths of 330-440 nm,
   while the initial spectral slope of the samples explained up to 52\% of
   variability in epsilon(surf) at observation wavelengths of 310-330 nm.
   These results suggest that the biogeochemical and solar exposure history
   of the water column, each of which influence the chemical character and
   thus the spectral quality of CDOM and its photoreactivity, are the main
   factors regulating the susceptibility of CDOM to photodegradation in the
   surface ocean. The epsilon(surf) parameter reported herein may be
   applied to remote sensing retrievals of CDOM to estimate photobleaching
   at the surface on regional to global scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions in the western Arctic Ocean range from constant
   light and nutrient depletion in summer to complete darkness and sea ice
   cover in winter. This seasonal environmental variation is likely to have
   an effect on the use of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by heterotrophic
   bacteria in surface water. However, this effect is not well studied and
   we know little about the activity of specific bacterial clades in the
   surface oceans. The use of DOM by three bacterial subgroups in both
   winter and summer was examined by microautoradiography combined with
   fluorescence in situ hybridization. We found selective use of substrates
   by these groups, although the abundances of Ant4D3 (Antarctic
   Gammaproteobacteria), Polaribacter (Bacteroidetes), and SAR11
   (Alphaproteobacteria) were not different between summer and winter in
   the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. The number of cells taking up glucose
   within all three bacterial groups decreased significantly from summer to
   winter, while the percentage of cells using leucine did not show a clear
   pattern between seasons. The uptake of the amino acid mix increased
   substantially from summer to winter by the Ant4D3 group, although such a
   large increase in uptake was not seen for the other two groups. Use of
   glucose by bacteria, but not use of leucine or the amino acid mix,
   related strongly to inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll a, and other
   environmental factors. Our results suggest a switch in use of dissolved
   organic substrates from summer to winter and that the three phylogenetic
   subgroups examined fill different niches in DOM use in the two seasons.}},

   difficulties of sampling during this period. In this study, passive
   samplers were placed throughout paired High Arctic watersheds during the
   duration of the 2008 spring flush in Nunavut, Canada. The watersheds are
   very similar with the exception of widespread active layer detachments
   (ALDs) that occurred within one of the catchments during a period of
   elevated temperatures in the summer of 2007. DOM samples were analyzed
   for structural and spectral characteristics via nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as vulnerability
   to degradation with simulated solar exposure. Lignin-derived phenols
   were further assessed utilizing copper(II) oxide (CuO) oxidation and gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The samples were found to have
   very low dissolved lignin phenol content (similar to 0.07\% of DOC) and
   appear to originate from primarily non-woody angiosperm vegetation. The
   acid/aldehyde ratios for dissolved vanillyl phenols were found to be
   high (up to 3.6), indicating the presence of highly oxidized lignin.
   Differences between DOM released from the ALD vs. the undisturbed
   watershed suggest that these shallow detachment slides have
   significantly impacted the quality of Arctic DOM. Although material
   released from the disturbed catchment was found to be highly oxidized,
   DOM in the lake into which this catchment drained had chemical
   characteristics indicating high contributions from microbial and/or
   primary productivity. The resulting pool of dissolved carbon within the
   lake appears to be more biologically- and photochemically-labile than
   material from the undisturbed system. These disturbances may have
   implications for projected climate warming; sustained elevated
   temperatures would likely perpetuate widespread ALDs and further affect
   carbon cycling in this environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems and
   is derived from various inputs that control its turnover. Glaciers and
   ice sheets are the second largest water reservoir in the global
   hydrologic cycle, but little is known about glacial DOM composition or
   contributions to biogeochemical cycling. Here we employ SPR-W5-WATERGATE
   H-1 NMR spectroscopy to elucidate and quantify the chemical structures
   of DOM constituents in Antarctic glacial ice as they exist in their
   natural state (average DOC of 8 mg/L) without isolation or
   preconcentration. This Antarctic glacial DOM is predominantly composed
   of a mixture of small recognizable molecules differing from DOM in
   marine, lacustrine, and other terrestrial environments. The major
   constituents detected in three distinct types of glacial ice include
   lactic and formic acid, free amino acids, and a mixture of simple sugars
   and amino sugars with concentrations that vary between ice types. The
   detection of free amino acid and amino sugar monomer components of
   peptidoglycan within the ice suggests that Antarctic glacial DOM likely
   originates from in situ microbial activity. As these constituents are
   normally considered to be biologically labile (fast cycling) in
   nonglacial environments, accelerated glacier melt and runoff may result
   in a flux of nutrients into adjacent ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{62}},

Pages = {{61-69}},
Abstract = {{The biochemical composition of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) in the
   ocean is dominated by phosphoesters (C-O-P and C-O-P-O-C bonds), which
   are hydrolyzed by a diverse group of alkaline phosphatases (PhoA, PhoD,
   PhoX), and by phosphonates (C-P bond), which are degraded by C-P lyases
   and hydrolases. We designed a bioinformatics pipeline and a statistical
   approach to recover and analyze the alkaline phosphatase and phosphonate
   utilization genes from a metagenomic database derived from water samples
   collected from 7 depths (between 10 and 4000 m) in the oligotrophic
   North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The alkaline phosphatase genes phoD and
   phoX were more abundant than phoA in the euphotic zone (10-130 m) and in
   deep waters (500-4000 m). The C-P lyase genes were most abundant in the
   euphotic zone at 70 m and were rare in deep water (>= 500 m) where
   phosphate concentrations were relatively high. These observations
   indicate that phosphonates are utilized primarily as a phosphorus source
   by bacterial C-P lyases; this is consistent with the observation that
   C-P lyase genes are part of the pho regulon which is expressed upon
   phosphorus limitation. In contrast, C-P hydrolase and alkaline
   phosphatase genes were often more abundant in deep waters, indicating
   that DOP serves mainly as a carbon and energy source in phosphate-rich
   deep waters which are depleted in bioavailable dissolved organic matter
   (DOM). The observed differences in depth distributions and presumed
   functions of C-P lyase and hydrolase genes indicate variability in the
   chemical composition of phosphonates between the euphotic zone and deep
   waters.}},

Title = {{Application of a superoxide (O-2(-)) thermal source (SOTS-1) for the
   determination and calibration of O-2(-) fluxes in seawater}},
Journal = {{ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{667}},

Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{Superoxide (O-2(-)) is an important short lived transient reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) in seawater. The main source of O-2(-) in the ocean
   is believed to be through photochemical reactions though biological
   processes may also be important. Sink terms for O-2(-) include redox
   reactions with bioactive trace metals, including Cu and Fe, and to a
   lesser extent dissolved organic matter (DOM). Information on the source
   fluxes, sinks and concentration of superoxide in the open ocean are
   crucial to improving our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of
   redox active species. As O-2(-) is a highly reactive transient species
   present at low concentrations it is not a trivial task to make accurate
   and precise measurements in seawater. In this study we developed the
   appropriate numerical analysis tools and investigated a number of
   superoxide sources and methods for the purposes of calibrating O-2(-)
   concentrations and/or fluxes specifically in seawater. We found the
   superoxide thermal source bis(4-carboxybenzyl)hyponitrite (SOTS)-1 easy
   to employ as a reliable source of O-2(-) which could be successfully
   applied in seawater. The thermal decomposition of SOTS-1 in seawater was
   evaluated over a range of seawater temperatures using both a flux based
   detection scheme developed using two spectrophotometric methods: (i)
   7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) and (ii)
   ferricytochrome c (FC), or a concentration based detection scheme using
   a chemiluminescence flow injection method based on the Cypridina
   luciferin analog
   2-methyl-6-(p-methoxyphenyl)3-7-dihydroimidazol{[}1,2-alpha]pyrazin-3-on
   e (MCLA) as reagent. Our results suggest SOTS-1 is the best available
   O-2(-) source for determining concentrations and fluxes, all detection
   systems tested have their pros and cons and the choice of which to use
   depends more on the duration and type of experiment that is required.

Abstract = {{The cyanobacterial genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are key
   phototrophic organisms in the open ocean, and ecological interactions
   between these groups and heterotrophic bacteria have fundamental
   importance for marine carbon and nutrient cycling. We applied a
   microfluidic chemotaxis assay to study the chemotactic response of 3
   marine bacterial isolates (Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, Vibrio
   alginolyticus and Silicibacter sp. TM1040) to the chemical products of
   Synechococcus elongatus and Prochlorococcus marinus MED 4Ax. In the
   ocean, chemical products from these cyanobacteria may be released into
   the water column via extracellular exudation or cell lysis. Strong and
   rapid chemotactic responses by all 3 bacterial strains occurred in
   reaction to the Synechococcus products. P. haloplanktis cells exhibited
   the strongest attraction, accumulating within the chemoattractant band
   in concentrations of up to 9-fold above background levels. Positive
   chemotaxis to Prochlorococcus chemical products also occurred, with P.
   haloplanktis and Silicibacter sp. TM1040 exhibiting the strongest
   responses. These observations indicate that marine bacteria can exhibit
   behavioural responses to the chemical products of Synechococcus and

Number = {{3-4}},

Abstract = {{The photochemical oxidation of colored, dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
   is important for carbon cycling in the ocean. This oxidation process
   produces a number of products, including carbon monoxide (CO). While the
   photochemical production efficiency of CO (apparent quantum yield, AQY,
   defined in terms of CDOM absorbance) has been reported to be similar for
   many water types, a full evaluation of the observed natural variability
   in CO AQY requires additional study. Here we use a polychromatic
   irradiation system to determine twenty AQY spectra at sea on fresh
   samples ranging from the near coastal waters of the Gulf of Maine to the
   offshore waters of the Northwest Atlantic. Despite the geographic
   variability of these marine samples the AQY of CO production in the Gulf
   of Maine and Northwest Atlantic exhibited only a small degree of
   variability, none of which was not correlated with measured
   environmental parameters. Consequently, a single aggregate AQY spectrum
   phi(lambda)=e ((-(9.134+0.0425(lambda-290)))+e(-(1
   1.316+0.0142(lambda-290)))) was found to adequately represent the entire
   data set. Significantly, the accuracy of an AQY spectrum determined
   using this multispectral/ statistical technique was confirmed with data
   obtained from a monochromatic irradiation technique on a single open
   ocean sample. Taken together, the AQY spectra determined in this study
   were similar in magnitude and shape to those previously published for
   marine samples and, overall, were somewhat lower than those previously
   reported for freshwater studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry (DT-MS) was used to
   evaluate the molecular-level photodegradation of dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) isolated from three sites in a Chesapeake Bay subestuary
   (swamp- and marsh-influenced up-river, midestuarine, and bay mouth).
   From each site, filtered (<0.1 or <0.2 mu m) water samples were
   irradiated in solar-simulated ultraviolet light followed by isolation of
   the DOM using C-18-solid-phase extraction and subsequent DT-MS analysis.
   To provide background DOM photoreactivity data for the water samples, we
   also determined dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) photoproduction and
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) photobleaching. DIC
   photoproduction was correlated with initial DOM light absorbance,
   initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and
   photobleaching. Changes in DT-MS characteristics within the extracts (in
   particular, the loss of an ``aromatic{''} signal believed to be from
   reworked terrestrial material) were found to correlate linearly with the
   absorbance of the corresponding water samples. A relationship between
   photobleaching and DT-MS characteristics was also observed, with the
   upstream samples asymptotically approaching a constant
   ``molecular-level{''} value as photobleaching increased. Both
   relationships appeared to be independent of absorbance wavelength in the
   ultraviolet. Following irradiation, the swamp/marsh-dominated upstream
   samples resembled the down-stream samples in terms of absorption spectra
   and MS-determined molecular-level characteristics. These shifts indicate
   that terrestrially-derived DOM may be more difficult to differentiate
   from marine DOM upon photodegradation, which has implications regarding
   evaluating the terrestrial impact within the marine DOM pool.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to measure the biogeochemical characteristics of
   freshwater plumes underlying Baltic Sea land-fast ice, and the overlying
   sea ice. A 40-km long transect was conducted in the northern Baltic Sea
   in March 2003, following a freshwater plume from its source into the
   fully mixed open-sea area. The spreading of river outflow below the ice
   resulted in a well-stratified low-salinity surface layer further out
   than normally occurs in the open-water period. The freshwaters were high
   in dissolved organic matter (DOC, DON and CDOM), and inorganic nutrients
   (ammonium, nitrate and silicate), although the levels of phosphate were
   low. In general these parameters changed concurrently with salinity in
   such a way that mixing was conservative. The characteristics of the ice
   varied from the freshwater source to the open water, with increasing
   salinity and brine volumes (porosity) occurring in the more open-sea
   stations. Coinciding with the changes in ice properties there was an
   increase in sea-ice algal growth in the more marine stations along the
   transect. Biological activity in the ice was largely confined to bottom
   ice assemblages. In contrast to the conditions in the underlying water,
   no relationship between salinity, inorganic nutrients and organic matter
   was observed in the ice. In particular ammonium, phosphate, DOC and DON
   were present in excess of those levels predicted from the dilution
   curves, indicating the presence of considerable DOM production by ice
   assemblages, inorganic nutrient uptake and remineralization within the
   ice. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Biological consumption of carbon monoxide in Delaware Bay, NW Atlantic

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{290}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Abstract = {{Microbial consumption is the dominant sink of oceanic carbon monoxide
   (CO), one of the major carbon-containing photoproducts of chromophoric
   dissolved organic matter in marine waters. This study presents
   first-order microbial CO consumption rate constants (k(CO)) determined
   using whole-water dark incubations in summer and fall in diverse marine
   ecosystems covering the Delaware Bay, NW Atlantic, and Beaufort Sea. The
   microbial CO consumption rate constant, k(CO) (mean +/- SD) was 1.11 +/-
   0.76 h(-1) in the Delaware Bay, 0.33 +/- 0.26 h(-1) in the coastal
   Atlantic, 0.099 +/- 0.054 h(-1) in the open Atlantic, 0.040 +/- 0.012
   h(-1) in the coastal Beaufort Sea and 0.020 +/- 0.0060 h(-1) in the
   offshore Beaufort Sea. The k(CO)) in the Delaware Bay covaried with
   chlorophyll a concentration ({[}chl a]), rising with increasing salinity
   in the range 0 to 19 and diminishing with further increasing salinity.
   The k(CO) in the Beaufort Sea is significantly positively correlated
   with {[}chl a]. Both the Atlantic and cross-system data sets showed
   significant positive correlations between k(CO) and the product of
   {[}chl a] and water temperature, suggesting that {[}chl a] can be used
   as an indicator of CO-consuming bacterial activity in the areas and
   seasons sampled in this study. Microbial CO consumption was shown to
   follow Wright-Hobbie kinetics, with variable but low half-saturation
   concentrations: similar to 1 nM in the Beaufort Sea and Gulf Stream and
   2 to 18 nM in the coastal NW Atlantic. These low half-saturation
   concentrations suggest that microbial CO consumption in seawater is at
   times partly saturated, and that some previous microbial CO consumption
   rates determined with the commonly used (CO)-C-14 method could be
   underestimates due to the addition of (CO)-C-14 as a tracer substrate.
   The present study provides valuable data for coastal and Arctic waters
   whose k(CO) values are poorly or rot constrained, including extensive
   data on the dependence of k(CO) on the concentration of CO.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal variation of pCO(2) and primary and bacterioplankton production
   were measured in the Gulf of Bothnia during an annual cycle. Surface
   water was supersaturated with CO(2) on an annual basis, indicating net
   heterotrophy and a source of CO(2) to the atmosphere. However, the Gulf
   of Bothnia oscillated between being a sink and a source of CO(2) over
   the studied period, largely decided by temporal variation in bacterial
   respiration (BR) and primary production (PP) in the water column above
   the pycnocline. The calculated annual respiration-production balance
   (BR-PP) was very similar to the estimated CO(2) emission from the Gulf
   of Bothnia, which indicates that these processes were major determinants
   of the exchange of CO(2) between water and atmosphere. The southern
   basin (the Bothnian Sea) had a lower net release of CO(2) to the
   atmosphere than the northern Bothnian Bay (7.1 and 9.7 mmol C m(-2)
   d(-1), respectively), due to higher primary production, which to a
   larger extent balanced respiration in this basin.}},

Abstract = {{In vitro measurements, predictions, and geochemical estimates of the
   balance between gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration
   (CR) in the open ocean do not agree. This has generated an active debate
   about the carbon balance in unproductive pelagic marine ecosystems. The
   analysis of generalized GPP:CR relationships that sustains this debate
   assumes a continuous trophic gradient or the simple partition of the
   World Ocean into productive and unproductive regimes. We measured
   euphotic zone GPP and CR along a latitudinal (40degrees N-30degrees S)
   transect across the Atlantic Ocean, which included two open-ocean
   oligotrophic provinces: the eastern area of the North Atlantic
   Subtropical Gyre (NAST-E) and the center of the South Atlantic Gyre
   (SATL). Net heterotrophy prevailed in the euphotic zone of the NAST-E,
   while the plankton community in the central SATL was net autotrophic. A
   review of published studies of net plankton metabolism in the open ocean
   substantiates this geographic pattern, suggesting the existence of
   different trophic dynamics in similarly unproductive planktonic
   communities that might be characterized by the relative importance of
   local vs. allochthonous sources of organic matter. No universal
   relationship appears to exist between the magnitude of photosynthesis of
   a pelagic ecosystem and its net metabolism. We tested the published
   GPP:CR relationships and found that each one was only able to correctly
   predict GPP:CR balances in either the heterotrophic NASTE or the
   autotrophic SATL, thus confirming that the geographic pattern in net
   community metabolism is related to the functional diversity of
   unproductive oceanic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Marine viruses have been shown to affect phytoplankton productivity;
   however, there are no reports on the effect of viruses on benthic
   microalgae (microphytobenthos). Hence, this study investigated the
   effects of elevated concentrations of virus-like particles on the
   photosynthetic physiology and community composition of benthic
   microalgae and phytoplankton. Virus populations were collected near the
   sediment surface and concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration,
   and the concentrate was added to benthic and water column samples that
   were obtained along a eutrophication gradient in the Brisbane
   River/Moreton Bay estuary, Australia. Photosynthetic and community
   responses of benthic microalgae, phytoplankton and bacteria were
   monitored over 7 d in aquaria and in situ. Benthic microalgal
   communities responded to viral enrichment in both eutrophic and
   oligotrophic sediments. In eutrophic sediments, Euglenophytes (Euglena
   sp.) and bacteria decreased in abundance by 20 to 60 and 26 to 66\%,
   respectively, from seawater controls. In oligotrophic sediments,
   bacteria decreased in abundance by 30 to 42\% from seawater controls but
   the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium sp. increased in abundance by 270 to
   3600\% from seawater controls, The increased abundance of Gymnodinium
   sp. may be related to increased availability of dissolved organic matter
   released from lysed bacteria. Increased (140 to 190\% from seawater
   controls) initial chlorophyll a fluorescence measured with a
   pulse-amplitude modulated fluorometer was observed in eutrophic benthic
   microalgal incubations following virus enrichment, consistent with
   photosystem II damage. Virus enrichment in oligotrophic water
   significantly stimulated carbon fixation rates, perhaps due to increased
   nutrient availability by bacterial lysis. The interpretation of data
   from virus amendment experiments is difficult due to potential
   interaction with unidentified bioactive compounds within seawater
   concentrates. However, these results show that viruses are capable of
   influencing microbial dynamics in sediments.}},

Abstract = {{The bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was investigated
   in the Gulf of Riga during spring and summer 1996. The Gulf of Riga is a
   sub-basin of the southern Baltic proper, characterized by low salinity
   (2-7) and a riverine discharge amounting to 7\% of the total volume per
   year. Samples were collected in the northern and southeast part of the
   Gulf of Riga in transects extending 5-13 km offshore. During summer, DOC
   concentrations increased by 70-600 mu M C indicating an imbalance
   between input and degradation of organic carbon in the system. The pool
   size of labile DOC (L-DOC) was determined in predator-free bacterial
   seawater cultures enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus by following the
   decline in DOC during bacterial growth. L-DOC made up 30-100\% of the
   DOC that accumulated during summer and the pool increased 2-4-fold
   compared with spring. Bacterial growth rate limitations were studied
   using incubations of unfiltered seawater enriched with nutrients or
   subjected to increased temperature. Nutrient additions had little or no
   effect on the community turnover time even when glucose, ammonium and
   phosphate were added together, while a 10 degrees C shift-up in
   temperature increased the turnover time IO-fold. This indicates that the
   bacteria were growing at maximum growth rate at the in situ temperature.
   The results suggest that the underlying mechanism for accumulation of
   L-DOC was growth rate limitation of the bacterial community caused by
   low in situ temperature in combination with control by predators. (C)

Title = {{Role of mesopelagic zooplankton in the community metabolism of giant

Abstract = {{The mucous feeding structures or `houses' of the giant larvacean
   Bathochordaeus spp. provide a useful detrital system to study biological
   processes that mediate remineralization of particulate organic carbon in
   the mesopelagic zone: degradation by bacteria and grazing by
   zooplankton. The role of particle-associated zooplankton in
   remineralization in the mesopelagic zone has not previously been
   studied, mostly due to sampling difficulties. We collected houses
   between 100 and 500 m in Monterey Bay, California, USA, using a
   submersible ROV (remotely operated Vehicle) and measured community
   metabolism on houses using oxygen electrodes. Houses were sites of
   elevated metabolic activity compared to surrounding waters. The average
   daily oxygen utilization indicates that approximately 1\% of house C is
   used daily to sustain community respiration, although the rate is higher
   (8\%) when large numbers of zooplankton are present. Estimated rates of
   zooplankton remineralization of houses are similar to bacterial
   remineralization rates reported for other types of detritus. Respiration
   rates provide minimal estimates of carbon transformations by communities
   on detritus, especially when metazoans are present. Based on published
   estimates of the relationship between zooplankton carbon consumption and
   respiration rates, and our measurement of zooplankton abundance on
   houses, we calculate that a mean of 6\% and up to 43\% of house C is
   ingested by zooplankton each day. Thus, a substantial part of the house
   could be consumed by detritus-feeding zooplankton before sinking out of
   the mesopelagic zone. Particle-associated zooplankton are important in
   recycling carbon on these houses and potentially on other aggregates at
   depth, not only by consuming and remineralizing detritus, but also by
   altering detritus through repackaging it in fecal pellets, releasing it
   as DOC, and fragmenting its fragile structure into smaller particulate
   matter.}},

Abstract = {{Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in marine waters. These prokaryotic cells
   are of particular interest in areas of the ocean where the availability
   of iron may be limiting for cell growth since these organisms commonly
   excrete iron-specific organic ligands (siderophores) in response to low
   levels of iron. It is generally considered that the production of
   siderophores provides a competitive advantage over the competing
   microorganisms that do not produce these ligands.
   In order to ascertain the influence of iron availability on the
   physiology of picoplanktonic cyanobacteria we performed a series of
   experiments on the coastal coccoid cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. PCC
   7002. Physiological responses were examined in cells grown in a
   continuous cuture system with influx media containing a range of iron
   concentrations (from 4.2 x 10(-5) to 5.1 X 10(-9) M FeCl3). Steady-state
   growth rates, combined with growth data from batch cultures demonstrated
   a non-linear response between iron availability and cell proliferation:
   cell yields were considerably higher in the lowest-iron chemostats than
   predicted based on the yields in the higher-iron chemostats. The higher
   yields during low-iron growth corresponded with the production of the
   extracellular siderophores and the induction of the specific
   iron-siderophore membrane transport proteins. A comparison of iron
   transport and carbon acquisition rates between the low-iron grown cells
   and the high-iron grown cells indicates that under low-iron growth
   conditions, iron and carbon acquisition meets the growth demands of the
   cells, whereas growth at higher iron levels enabled excessive (luxury)
   carbon acquisition and storage. We conclude that cyanobacteria are
   efficiently adapted to grow in low-iron environments (providing
   sufficient light for photosynthesis is available) and the luxury-uptake
   of carbon may serve as the source material for the extracellular ligands
   released by these cells. Since the release of siderophores was at iron
   levels in excess of the levels that induce the siderophore-mediated
   transport of iron, cyanobacteria growing in an environment with varying
   levels of iron may contribute substantial amounts of their stored carbon
   reserves into the DOC as iron-specific ligands.}},

Title = {{THE ROLE OF INTERTIDAL MUDBANKS IN THE DIAGENESIS AND EXPORT OF
   DISSOLVED AND PARTICULATE MATERIALS FROM THE FLY-DELTA, PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1991}},

Pages = {{81-107}},
Abstract = {{Benthic processes and sedimentary structures of intertidal mudbanks
   within the Fly Delta, Papua New Guinea, were examined to assess their
   role in the storage, utilization and export of nutrients from the river
   delta to the adjacent Gulf of Papua. Three types of mudbanks were
   recognized based on interpretation of x-radiographs of sediment cores: a
   physically dominated, high sedimentation regime (one station), a
   biologically dominated, low-to-moderate sedimentation regime (one
   station) and a ``transitional{''} regime (two stations).
   Meiofaunal (29-340 ind.10 cm-2) and macroinfaunal (174-6185 ind.m-2)
   densities varied widely, being lowest at the physically controlled site
   and dominated mainly by small deposit- and suspension-feeding
   polychaetes, amphipods, oligochaetes and nematodes. Infaunal biomass was
   low (0.17-1.38 g AFDW.m-2) across stations. Bacterial densities
   (0.14-1.5 x 10(10) cells.g-1 DW) were highest at the physically and
   biologically controlled sites. Bacterial C production was estimated from
   rates of protein (H-3-leucine incorporation) and DNA (H-3-thymidine
   incorporation) synthesis. The methods did not agree well, with rates of
   DNA synthesis (187-413 mg C.m-2.d-1) several times higher than
   production estimates derived from H-3-leucine incorporation (18-75 mg
   C.m-2.d-1). However, specific growth rates (mu) derived using both
   methods correlated strongly (r = +0.90), with high rates across 20-cm
   depth horizons at all four stations.
   Levels of particulate organic C, total N, total P in the sediments and
   dissolved organic (DOC, DON, DOP) and inorganic (NH4+, NO2- + NO3-,
   Si(OH)4+, PO4(3-)) nutrients in the porewaters were low compared to
   other benthic habitats and generally varied little with sediment depth.
   The average stoichiometric ratio of solid-phase nutrients was low
   (atomic C:N:P = 42:6:1), suggesting that the material was in very early
   stages of diagenesis. Fluxes of dissolved inorganic and organic
   nutrients across the sediment-water interface were mostly undetectable
   and rates of O2 consumption (145-206 mg C.m-2.d-1) and gross primary
   production (159-240 mg C.m-2.d-1) were low, as were Chl a
   (0.5-0.8-mu-g.g-1 DW) and phaeopigments (2.5-4.2-mu-g.g-1 DW). The two
   transitional stations had large quantities (482-1075 g DW.m-2) of
   deposited macroparticulate plant litter.
   It is proposed that the rapidly growing, bacterial communities in these
   sediments sequester and mineralize most of the labile organic matter
   deposited onto these mudbanks, leading to the observed lack of nutrient
   flux across the sediment-water interface and the general absence of
   vertical solid-phase and porewater nutrient profiles. Intertidal
   mudbanks of the Fly Delta therefore act as nutrient sinks rather than as
   net exporters of nutrients which may support coastal food chains in the
   adjacent Gulf of Papua.}},

Abstract = {{Many protist plankton are mixotrophs, combining phototrophy and
   phagotrophy. Their role in freshwater and marine ecology has emerged as
   a major developing feature of plankton research over recent decades. To
   better aid discussions, we suggest these organisms are termed
   ``mixoplankton{''}, as ``planktonic protist organisms that express, or
   have potential to express, phototrophy and phagotrophy{''}. The term
   ``phytoplankton{''} then describes phototrophic organisms incapable of
   phagotrophy. ``Protozooplankton{''} describes phagotrophic protists that
   do not engage in acquired phototrophy. The complexity of the changes to
   the conceptual base of the plankton trophic web caused by inclusion of
   mixoplanktonic activities are such that we suggest that the restructured
   description is termed the ``mixoplankton paradigm{''}. Implications and
   opportunities for revision of survey and fieldwork, of laboratory
   experiments and of simulation modelling are considered. The main
   challenges are not only with taxonomic and functional identifications,
   and with measuring rates of potentially competing processes within
   single cells, but with decades of inertia built around the traditional
   paradigm that assumes a separation of trophic processes between
   different organisms. In keeping with the synergistic nature of
   cooperative photo- and phagotrophy in mixoplankton, a comprehensive
   multidisciplinary approach will be required to tackle the task ahead.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) samples collected from water
   masses of Beaufort Sea (n = 12) and the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre
   (NASG; n = 6) were assessed based on susceptibilities of its parallel
   factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeled fluorescent components to
   photobleaching over 72 hours of simulated solar irradiation. 315
   excitation-emission matrix spectra (EEMs) were PARAFAC modeled yielding
   4 humic-like (C1-3 and C5) and 1 protein-like (C4) fluorescent
   components. Protein-like C4 and humic-like C5 did not adhere to first
   order kinetics and did not yield decay rate constant (k) or half-life
   (t(1/2)) values as part of this study. Humic-like Cl was found to be
   most resilient to photodegradation with lowest k values. Principal
   component analysis (PCA) illustrated a shift towards C1\% with
   photo-exposure in addition to distinguishing compositions of C1-5\% in
   Beaufort Sea halocline and Atlantic layer as well as NASG deep water
   masses. When Beaufort Sea water masses were considered, k of C2 was
   found to be lower in upper (UH) and mid (MH) halocline layers when
   compared to lower halocline (LH) and underlying Atlantic layer (AL;
   p<0.10). This suggested that C2 in Pacific-derived seawater was less
   photoreactive than C2 in Atlantic-derived seawater in Beaufort Sea,
   likely as a result of distinct formation pathways of these water masses.
   Similarly, C2 in upper Labrador Seawater (ULSW) and `classical' Labrador
   seawater (LSW) was less photolabile than in deeper NASG layers
   (Iceland-Scotland and Denmark Strait overflow waters; ISOW and DSOW).
   Interestingly, despite similar formation pathways of AL in Beaufort Sea
   and deeper waters sampled from NASG (ISOW + DSOW), lower k for Cl was
   found in NASG. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Geochemistry of redox-sensitive trace elements in a shallow subterranean
   estuary}},
Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{70-81}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is an important component of
   chemical fluxes in the coastal ocean. The composition of SGD is
   influenced by biogeochemical reactions that take place within the
   subterranean estuary (STE), the subsurface mixing zone of fresh and
   saline groundwaters. The STE is characterized by redox gradients that
   affect the speciation and mobility of redox-sensitive elements (RSEs).
   We examined the distributions and behavior of the RSEs Mo, U, V, and Cr
   within the larger redox framework of a shallow STE and evaluated the
   source-sink function of the STE for these elements. We found that the
   advection of water through the STE and the apparent respiration of
   organic matter drives the formation of a ``classic{''} redox sequence
   typically observed in diffusion-dominated fine-grained sediments. High
   concentrations of dissolved organic matter (up to 2.9 mM) lead to
   extensive sulfide production (up to 1.8 mM) within 3 m of the surface.
   Both Mo and U are quantitatively removed as oxic surface waters mix into
   ferruginous and sulfidic zones. Molybdenum removal appears to occur
   where sulfide concentrations exceed similar to 11 mu M, a previously
   reported threshold for quantitative formation of highly
   particle-reactive thiomolybdate species. Uranium removal apparently
   occurs via reduction and formation of insoluble phases or sorption to
   sediments. It is not clear how readily sequestered metals may be
   returned to solution, but SGD may be an important sink in the marine
   budget for both Mo and U. In contrast, both V and Cr show
   non-conservative addition across the salinity mixing gradient. Increases
   in pH appear to promote dissolution of V from minerals within the
   shallow aquifer, and mobilization may also be associated with dissolved
   organic matter. Chromium enrichment is associated with higher dissolved
   organic matter and is likely due to the formation of soluble Cr-organic
   complexes. Fluxes of these elements were constrained using SGD volume

Title = {{A new model for the global biogeochemical cycle of carbonyl sulfide -

Abstract = {{The global budget of tropospheric carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is believed to
   be at equilibrium because background air concentrations have remained
   roughly stable over at least the last decade. Since the uptake of OCS by
   leaves (associated with photosynthesis) and soils have been revised
   significantly upwards recently, an equilibrated budget can only be
   obtained with a compensatory source of OCS. It has been assumed that the
   missing source of OCS comes from the low-latitude ocean, following the
   incident solar flux. The present work uses parameterizations of major
   production and removal processes of organic compounds in the NEMO-PISCES
   (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean, Pelagic Interaction Scheme
   for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies) ocean general circulation and
   biogeochemistry model to assess the marine source of OCS. In addition,
   the OCS photo-production rates computed with the NEMO-PISCES model were
   evaluated independently using the UV absorption coefficient of
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter (derived from satellite ocean
   color data) and apparent quantum yields available in the literature. Our
   simulations show global direct marine emissions of OCS in the range of
   5733997 GgS yr(-1), depending mostly on the quantification of the
   absorption rate of chromophoric dissolved organic matter. The high
   estimates of that range are unlikely, as they correspond to a
   formulation that most likely overestimate photo-production process. Low
   and medium (813 GgS yr(-1)) estimates derived from the NEMO-PISCES model
   are however consistent spatially and temporally with the suggested
   missing source of Berry et al. (2013), allowing us thus to close the
   global budget of OCS given the recent estimates of leaf and soil OCS
   uptake.}},

   acids and lignin-derived phenols in a river-influenced ocean margin}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with
   parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) is commonly used to investigate the
   dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM). However, a lack of direct
   comparisons with known biomolecules makes it difficult to substantiate
   the molecular composition of specific fluorescent components. Here,
   coincident surface-water measurements of EEMs, dissolved lignin, and
   total dissolved amino acids (TDAA) acquired in the northern Gulf of
   Mexico were used to investigate the relationships between specific
   fluorescent components and DOM biomolecules. Two terrestrial humic-like
   components identified by EEM-PARAFAC using samples obtained from river
   to offshore waters were strongly linearly correlated with dissolved
   lignin concentrations. In addition, changes in terrestrial humic-like
   abundance were correlated with those in lignin phenol composition,
   suggesting such components are largely derived from lignin and its
   alteration products. By applying EEM-PARAFAC to offshore samples, two
   protein-like components were obtained. The tryptophan-like component was
   strongly correlated with TDAA concentrations, corroborating the
   suggested protein/peptide origin of this component. The ratios of
   tryptophan-like component to tyrosine-like component or dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were also correlated with
   DOC-normalized yields of TDAA, suggesting these proxies are useful
   indicators of the bioavailability of DOM in marine waters of the studied
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional methods for investigating stream solute biogeochemistry
   measure longitudinal rates of uptake by increasing either the
   concentration or isotopic composition of solutes. These methods cannot
   be applied to dissolved organic matter (DOM) because we cannot replicate
   the heterogeneous native DOM pool. We explored an alternative approach,
   attempting to displace or enhance benthic uptake of native DOM by
   supplying an exogenous source of labile carbon or by enriching the
   stream with inorganic nitrogen. This approach allows us to measure
   uptake rates of enriched solutes, as well as changes in the
   concentration and composition of native DOM resulting from the
   experimental manipulations. We examined DOM composition using
   fluorescence characterization. We were able to elicit changes in the
   chemical composition of native DOM by differentially altering the
   dynamics of autotrophic production and heterotrophic uptake within the
   second- order reach of Walker Branch, a well- studied stream in eastern
   Tennessee. Supplying heterotrophs with labile carbon resulted in an
   increase in fluorescence associated with terrestrially derived DOM.
   Stimulating algae by adding inorganic nitrogen increased autochthonous
   production and indirectly displaced heterotrophic demand for terrestrial
   DOM due to increased in- stream production of bioavailable DOM. While we
   were able to alter the composition of the native DOM pool, we observed
   little change in DOM concentrations. The ability to differentiate
   between DOM subcomponents provides insight into processes controlling
   DOM production and consumption that cannot be gained by treating DOM as
   a single bulk pool.}},

Abstract = {{Iron speciation in the Satilla River Estuary was investigated using
   competitive ligand equilibration-adsorptive cathodic stripping
   voltammetry (CLE-ACSV) with the ligand 1-nitroso-2-naphthol (1N2N). The
   blackwater Satilla River contains high concentrations of dissolved
   organic matter and iron, suggesting that it could provide a source of
   dissolved iron to the continental shelf. Total dissolved iron in the
   water column decreases along the estuary, likely due to flocculation and
   precipitation processes associated with the increase in salinity.
   Simultaneously, the percentage of dissolved organic-Fe(III) complexes
   measured by CLE-ACSV in overlying waters of sediment cores increases
   with salinity. The speciation of dissolved iron in the pore waters
   indicates that these complexes originate in the underlying sediments.
   Diffusive fluxes calculated from depth profiles in the sediments
   indicate that only 8\% of the sedimentary flux of Fe(III) is delivered
   to the continental shelf during low riverine discharge. During normal
   flow conditions, however, the sediment flux of Fe(III) represents 63\%
   of the total riverine flux of Fe(III). These findings suggest that the
   flux of dissolved iron to the continental shelf is controlled by the
   sedimentation of iron in the estuary and the remobilization of soluble
   organic-Fe(III) complexes produced either during iron reduction deep in
   the sediment or oxidation of Fe(II) close to the sediment-water
   interface. The Satilla River Estuary generates five to eight times
   higher concentrations of dissolved Fe(III) than the average major world
   rivers, suggesting that it is, along with other small blackwater rivers,
   currently underrepresented in world average river flux calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Iron oxides are important terminal electron acceptors for organic carbon
   (OC) remineralization in subterranean estuaries, particularly where
   oxygen and nitrate concentrations are low. In Indian River Lagoon,
   Florida, USA, terrestrial Fe-oxides dissolve at the seaward edge of the
   seepage face and flow upward into overlying marine sediments where they
   precipitate as Fe-sulfides. The dissolved Fe concentrations vary by over
   three orders of magnitude, but Fe-oxide dissolution rates are similar
   across the 25-m wide seepage face, averaging around 0.21 mg/cm(2)/yr.
   The constant dissolution rate, but differing concentrations, indicate Fe
   dissolution is controlled by a combination of increasing lability of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and slower porewater flow velocities with
   distance offshore. In contrast, the average rate constants of Fe-sulfide
   precipitation decrease from 21.9 x 10(-8) s(-1) to 0.64 x 10(-8) s(-1)
   from the shoreline to the seaward edge of the seepage face as more
   oxygenated surface water circulates through the sediment. The amount of
   OC remineralized by Fe-oxides varies little across the seepage face,
   averaging 5.34 x 10(-2) mg/cm(2)/yr. These rates suggest about 3.4 kg of
   marine DOC was remineralized in a 1-m wide, shore-perpendicular strip of
   the seepage face as the terrestrial sediments were transgressed over the
   past 280 years. During this time, about 10 times more marine solid
   organic carbon (SOC) accumulated in marine sediments than were removed
   from the underlying terrestrial sediments. Indian River Lagoon thus
   appears to be a net sink for marine OC. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The decay kinetics of superoxide (O-2(-)) reacting with organic matter
   was examined in oligotrophic waters at, and nearby, the TENATSO ocean
   observatory adjacent to the Cape Verde archipelago. Superoxide is the
   short-lived primary photochemical product of colored dissolved organic
   matter (CDOM) photolysis and also reacts with CDOM or trace metals (Cu,
   Fe) to form H2O2. In the present work we focused our investigations on
   reactions between CDOM and superoxide. O-2(-) decay kinetics experiments
   were performed by adding KO2 to diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid
   (DTPA) amended seawater and utilizing an established chemiluminescence
   technique for the detection of O-2 at nM levels. In Cape Verdean waters
   we found a significant reactivity of superoxide with CDOM with maximal

Abstract = {{In the marine environment, transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) are
   ubiquitous and abundant, playing a significant role in carbon cycling
   and the structuring of food webs. Previous studies have shown that
   phytoplankton, bacteria, and oysters contribute to the production of TEP
   through the release of exopolymers. However, little is known about other
   potential sources of TEP and TEP precursors, especially in coastal
   systems. It was hypothesized that suspension feeders contribute to the
   TEP pool in near-shore environments through the release of exopolymers
   in both the dissolved and particulate form, and tested these hypotheses
   in both laboratory and field experiments. In the laboratory, the
   production of TEP by several species of benthic suspension feeders (the
   blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians; the
   slipper snail, Crepidula fornicata; and the solitary ascidians, Ciona
   intestinalis and Styela clava) was investigated from October to November
   2002 and June 2003. Concentrations of TEP and DOC were determined by
   spectrophotometry after alcian blue staining and high-temperature,
   catalytic oxidation, respectively. Similar analyses were conducted on
   water samples from the field in July 2003, collected in close proximity
   to dense beds of mussels in the Poquonnock River, Connecticut, USA (41
   degrees 19' N, -72 degrees 02' W). Laboratory results indicated that
   activelypumping blue mussels, bay scallops, slipper snails, and both
   species of solitary ascidians significantly enhanced TEP concentrations
   above background levels over a five-hour period. However, only the
   solitary tunicate S. clava significantly enhanced DOC concentrations
   above background levels over the same period of time. Field samples
   indicated that TEP and DOC concentrations were high in close proximity
   to dense beds of mussels. These results imply that a variety of benthic
   suspension feeders produce TEP during feeding activities which could
   lead to enhanced flocculation of organic matter and carbon deposition in
   near-shore waters. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ethene (ethylene; H2C = CH2) is one of a range of non-methane
   hydrocarbons (NMHC) that affect atmospheric chemistry and global
   climate. Ethene acts as a hormone in higher plants and its role in plant
   biochemistry, physiology and ecology has been the subject of extensive
   research. Ethene is also found in seawater, but despite evidence that
   marine microalgae and seaweeds can produce ethene directly, its
   production is generally attributed to photochemical breakdown of
   dissolved organic matter. Here we confirmed ethene production in
   cultured samples of the macroalga Ulva (Enteromorpha) intestinalis.
   Ethene levels increased substantially when samples acclimatized to low
   light conditions were transferred to high light, and ethene addition
   reduced chlorophyll levels by 30\%. A range of potential inhibitors and
   inducers of ethene biosynthesis were tested. Evidence was found for
   ethene synthesis via the 1-aminocylopropane-1-acrylic acid (ACC) pathway
   and ACC oxidase activity was confirmed for cell-free extracts. Addition
   of acrylate, a potential ethene precursor in algae that contain the
   compatible solute dimethylsulphoniopropionate, doubled the ethene
   produced but no acrylate decarboxylase activity was found. Nonetheless
   the data support active production of ethene and we suggest ethene may
   play a multifaceted role in algae as it does in higher plants.}},

Abstract = {{Light attenuation in marine ecosystems can limit primary production and
   determine the species composition and abundance of primary producers. In
   Florida Bay, the importance of understanding the present light
   environment has heightened as major upstream water management
   restoration projects have been proposed and some are already being
   implemented. We analyzed a 2-yr (2001-2003) data set of the light
   attenuation coefficient (Kt) and its principal components (water,
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter {[}CDOM], tripton, phytoplankton)
   obtained at 40 stations within Florida Bay, calibrated synoptic underway
   data to produce high spatial resolution maps, examined the potential for
   light limitation, and quantified the individual effect of each component
   upon tight attenuation. Tripton was the dominant component controlling
   tight attenuation throughout Florida Bay, whereas the contribution of
   chlorophyll a and CDOM to Kt was much smaller in all regions of Florida
   Bay. It was possible to accurately estimate the light attenuation
   coefficient from component concentrations, using either a mechanistic or
   a statistical model with root mean square errors of 0.252 or 0.193
   m(-1), respectively. Compared to other estuaries, Florida Bay had the
   lowest overall Kt and the greatest relative contribution from tripton.
   Comparing the recent data to a study of Florida Bay's light environment
   conducted in 1993-1994, we found that overall water clarity in the Bay
   increased significantly, indicated by a nearly 3-fold decrease in Kt, as
   a result of lower tripton concentrations, although the percent
   contribution of each of the components to K, is unchanged. Only the
   northwest corner of Florida Bay, an area comprised of approximately 8\%
   of the Bay's total area, was found on average to have sufficient light
   attenuation to limit the growth of seagrasses. This is much less
   extensive than in 1993-1994, when seagrass growth was potentially
   limited by light at over 50\% of the stations sampled.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{205-218}},
Abstract = {{A zero-dimensional model for phytoplanktonic production in turbid,
   macro-tidal, well-mixed estuaries is proposed. It is based on the
   description of light-dependent algal growth, phytoplankton respiration
   and mortality. The model is forced by simple time-functions for solar
   irradiance, water depth and light penetration. The extinction
   coefficient is directly related to the dynamics of suspended particulate
   matter. Model results show that the description of phytoplankton growth
   must operate at a time resolution sufficiently high to describe the
   interference between solarly and tidally driven physical forcing
   functions. They also demonstrate that in shallow to moderately deep
   systems, simulations using averaged, instead of time-varying, forcing
   functions lead to significant errors in the estimation of phytoplankton
   productivity. The highest errors are observed when the temporal pattern
   of light penetration, linked to the tidal cycle of solids settling and
   resuspension, is neglected. The model has also been applied using
   realistic forcing functions typical of two locations in the Scheldt
   estuary. Model results are consistent with the typical phytoplankton
   decay observed along the longitudinal, seaward axis in the tidal river
   and oligohaline part of this estuary.}},

   the Northern Adriatic Sea: analysis of the 1997 event in comparison to
   earlier events}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{50}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{reported. These observations, compared to a longer time series
   (1985-1998), indicate that processes on short temporal scales and abrupt
   changes of the physical and biogeochemical conditions in the basin have
   a great effect on mucilage events.
   The seawater warming during the years with the mucilage was delayed in
   May and June compared to those without aggregate. Since the same typical
   summer values were afterward reached in both cases, a more abrupt
   warming is supposed in the period preceding mucilage events.
   During 1997, the Po River regime had an abrupt change from very low flow
   rates in April-May (526-985 m(3) s(-1)) to a strong freshet in July
   (4870 m(3) s(-1)). This river pulse, coupled to the scarce intrusion of
   the high salinity Middle Adriatic Deep Water (MAdDW), determined the
   large retention of low salinity waters in the Northern Adriatic Sea from
   July to September. In 1997, as well as during the events in 1989, 1991,
   the freshwater content in the basin was two times higher (4-5\%) with
   respect to the years without aggregates from 1992 to 1998 (<2\%).
   The biological response to these physical forcings was an intense
   phytoplankton bloom in the western low salinity waters in July 1997
   (O(2)sat. up to 206\%, Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) up to 7.64 mug dm(-3)), a
   common feature in all years with mucilage. It determined a strong
   increase of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON, +100\%) and phosphorus
   (DOP, +39\%) in the most productive western waters of the basin, which
   constitute available material for mucilage formation. Nutrient content
   in the upper waters shifted in concomitance to mucilage appearance, from
   a PO4-scarce condition in spring (Si/N/P = 225:105: 1), to a rather
   severe dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and SiO4-depletion in summer
   (Si/N/P = 21:13: 1). This drastic change can stimulate exudate
   hyperproduction and/or modify bacteria degradation capacity of organic
   matter.
   As a consequence of degradation of sinking aggregates, in summer 1997
   strong hypoxic conditions were reached in the deeper waters (down to
   55\% in most of the profile, down to 16\% in the western area).
   Increasing AOU/DIN (up to 143) and AOU/PO4 (up to 2500) ratios indicated
   a progressive nitrogen and phosphorous impoverishment in aged
   aggregates.

Abstract = {{The role of iron and light in controlling photosynthate production and
   allocation in phytoplankton populations of the Atlantic sector of the
   Southern Ocean was investigated in April-May 1999. The C-14
   incorporation into five biochemical pools (glucan, amino acids,
   proteins, lipids and polysaccharides) was measured during iron/light
   perturbation experiments. The diurnal Chl a-specific rates of carbon
   incorporation into these pools did not change in response to iron
   addition, yet were decreased at 20 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1), an
   irradiance comparable with the one at 20-45 m in situ depth. This
   suggests that the low phytoplankton biomass encountered (0.1-0.6 mug Chl
   a L-1) was mainly caused by light limitation in the deep wind mixed
   layer (>40 m). Regional differences in Chl a-specific carbon
   incorporation rates were not found in spite of differences in
   phytoplankton species composition: at the Antarctic Polar Front, biomass
   was dominated by a diatom population of Fragilariopsis kerguelensis,
   whereas smaller cells, including chrysophytes, were relatively more
   abundant in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current beyond the influence of
   frontal systems. Because mixing was often in excess of 100 m in the
   latter region, diatom cells may have been unable to fulfil their
   characteristically high Fe demand at low average light conditions, and
   thus became co-limited by both resources. Using a model that describes
   the C-14 incorporation, the consistency was shown between the dynamics
   in the glucan pool in the field experiments and in laboratory
   experiments with an Antarctic diatom, Chaetoceros brevis. The glucan
   respiration rate was almost twice as high during the dark phase as
   during the light phase, which is consistent with the role of glucan as a
   reserve supplying energy and carbon skeletons for continued protein
   synthesis during the night.}},

Abstract = {{The cross-flow ultrafiltration and radiotracer techniques were used to
   study the influences of natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and
   colloidal organic carbon (COC) on the bioavailability of Ag, Cd, and Cr
   to the green mussel Perna viridis. We examined the uptake of these
   metals by the mussels at different concentrations of DOC and COC front
   different origins (estuarine, coastal, and diatom decomposed). Using the
   DOC originating from the decomposed diatom (Thalassiosira pseudonana),
   we demonstrated that Cd and Cr uptake. quantified by the concentration
   factor (DCF), increased linearly with increasing DOC concentration.
   There was, however. no consistent influence of natural DOC concentration
   on the metal uptake when the DOC was obtained from different sources of
   seawater (coastal and estuarine). The influences of COC on metal
   bioavailability were metal-specific and dependent on the geochemical
   properties of colloids and colloid-metal complexation. Cd uptake rate
   was not influenced by the COC concentrations. Uptake of
   diatom-decomposed colloidal Cr was enhanced by 3.4x, whereas the uptake
   of diatom-decomposed colloidal Ag, was decreased by 8.2 x compared with
   the uptake of low molecular weight Cr and Ag (< 1 kDa). The uptake of
   diatom-decomposed colloidal Cr and Ag was generally lower than the
   Uptake of metals bound with the same type of colloids to 2 days. Further
   aging of the colloid-metal binding reduced metal bioavailability to the
   Mussels. In the presence of different sizes of colloidal particles where
   there was no major binding of colloids with the metals, metal Uptake by
   the mussels was not influenced by different COC concentrations. Overall,
   our study suggests that although metal dissociation from colloids may be
   an important step for the uptake of colloidal metals. other mechanisms
   such as pinocytosis and co-transport may also be involved in the uptake
   of these metals. especially in aquatic environments with high DOC and
   COC concentrations. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Energy transfer in microbial food webs is partly quantified by the
   relationship between bacterial and algal biomass. Tight spatial
   relationships suggest active bacterial assimilation of dissolved
   photosynthate in temperate marine and fresh waters. However, studies in
   the Antarctic suggest that bacterial biomass generation from
   algal-derived dissolved organic matter is highly variable across seasons
   and habitats. Regression analysis was used to measure how bacteria
   covaried with algae in sea ice and water column habitats at three sites
   around Antarctica. Bacteria and algae were positively related in sea ice
   of the Weddell Sea during early winter 1992 (r(2) = 0.16, slope = 0.24)
   and across sea ice and upper water column habitats of the Ross Sea
   during summer 1999 (r(2) = 0.52, slope 0.50). Conversely, bacteria and
   algae exhibited no discernible relationship in the water column and
   first year ice habitats of the Western Antarctic Peninsula region in
   winter 2001 (r(2) = 0.003, slope = -0.04). Low algal production and
   residual biomass probably limited bacterial production and facilitated
   bacteria-algae uncoupling in winter sea ice of the Western Antarctic
   Peninsula. Winter sea ice algal biomass was probably limited by a
   relatively late date of initial ice formation, reduced multi-year ice
   coverage, and a lack of radiant energy in the winter ice pack.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution and seasonal variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   and surface active substances (SAS) were studied along the depth profile
   (15 m) in a small eutrophicated and periodically anoxic sea lake
   (Rogoznica Lake, Eastern Adriatic coast) in 1996 and 1997. The range of
   DOC concentrations was characteristic fur productive coastal marine
   ecosystems (60\% of samples in the range of 1-2 mg l(-1) and 40\%
   between 2 and 3 mg l(-1)). Distribution of SAS concentrations was
   uniform and shifted coward higher concentrations in comparison to other
   coastal areas in the Adriatic Sea. Eutrophication in the lake is
   generated by nutrient recycling under anaerobic conditions.
   Systematically higher concentrations of chlorophyll a, DOC and SAS were
   determined at the chemocline in the bottom layer (10-12 m) than in the
   upper water layer (0.5-2 m). Seasonal variability of organic matter was
   discussed regarding distributions of microphytoplankton (cells >20 mum)
   and photosynthetic pigments as well as oxygen and salinity changes along
   the depth profile. The dissolved oxygen saturation reaching up to 300\%
   in the water layer between 8 m and 10 m depths in May and June 1996, was

Abstract = {{The influence of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the production rate and
   percentage of photosynthetic extracellular release (PER) to total
   production (PER + particulate) was investigated in the laboratory using
   the diatom species Chaetoceros muelleri grown under different nutrient
   and radiation conditions. Only when growing on higher nutrient
   concentrations (f/2 and f/4 media), were both specific particulate
   production and PER rates (production per unit chl a) were significantly
   lower in the presence of photosynthetic active radiation (PhAR) + UV as
   compared to the treatments receiving only PhAR. When growing on lower
   nutrient concentrations (f/16 medium), UV radiation had no significant
   effect on the production rates. The percentage of PER to the total
   amount of carbon fixed was similar for the PhAR + UV and the PhAR
   treatments. However, PER produced by C. muelleri during PhAR + UV
   exposure was taken up by bacterioplankton in the dark at significantly
   lower rates than PER produced in the absence of UV. This indicates that
   PER, considered as an important component of the dissolved organic
   carbon pool, becomes more resistant to bacterial utilization upon UV
   exposure. Whether this reduced PER-uptake by bacterioplankton is caused
   by changes in the macromolecular composition of the PER and/or is due to
   a subsequent photochemically induced alteration of the molecules during
   UV-exposure remains to be investigated.}},

   distribution coefficients (K'(OC)s) for several polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) versus their octanol-water partition coefficients
   (K'(OW)s) at two sites in the Elizabeth River, Virginia, show large
   deviations from linearity. Organic-carbon normalized distribution
   coefficients for these PAHs between sediments and pore waters decreased
   by more than two orders of magnitude with depth as well. To determine to
   what extent pore water dissolved and colloidal organic carbon (DOC) was
   responsible for the observed nonlinearity and decrease in K'(OC), a
   three-phase model was used to estimate pore-water PAH-DOC binding
   coefficients (K-DOC). Partitioning of PAHs to pore-water DOC (i.e.,
   K-DOC) enhances the observed ``dissolved{''} phase PAH concentration,
   especially for high-K-OW compounds, contributing to the nonlinearity in
   K'(OC)-K-OW plots. However, our application of the three-phase
   partitioning model to these data indicate that, at most, pore-water
   PAH-DOC binding accounts for one order of magnitude of the observed
   decrease in K'(OC) with depth in the sediment bed. The results of this

Abstract = {{The plankton of shallow lakes is expected to experience increasing
   exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) within the next decades. In
   addition to stratospheric ozone depletion, decreases in dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC), caused by climate warming or acidification, will
   result in greater UVR penetration in many lakes. Circulation patterns
   induced by moderate winds force the plankton of shallow lakes to be
   cycled through the whole water column. This translates into higher doses
   and fluctuating dosage rates. Here, we report the results of a series of
   `in situ' UV exposure experiments in which two zooplankton crustaceans
   (one capable of photorecovery and the other not) were incubated either
   at fixed depths or under simulated mixing. Our main goal was to assess
   the extent to which the results from static incubations could be
   extrapolated to vertically moving zooplankton. Static incubations
   accurately predicted the survival of moving individuals for the species
   without photorecovery, but failed to do so for the species capable of
   photorecovery. The fluctuations in dosage rate for high doses tended to
   increase the survival of the species with photorecovery. We contend that
   neglecting the effects of vertical mixing may result in a biased
   perception of UVR effects in shallow lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The development of sediment quality criteria (SQCs) for nonpolar
   compounds using equilibrium partitioning theory (EqP) requires three
   critical data elements for the compound of interest: (a) a reliable,
   measured K-ow; (b) an acceptable minimum data set for the development of
   the final acute and final chronic values necessary to calculate a
   water-quality criterion (WQC); and (c) `'check'' experiments with
   appropriate freshwater and marine benthic organisms to ensure that their
   responses in spiked-sediment tests are in agreement with responses
   predicted based on EqP. This study presents the results of dieldrin
   check experiments with two freshwater species: the amphipod Hyalella
   azteca and the chironomid Chironomus tentans. Ten-day, flow-through,
   water-only dieldrin LC50 values for the amphipod and chironomid were 7.6
   and 1.1 mu g/L, respectively. The LC50 values for the two species based
   on organic carbon-normalized sediment concentrations of dieldrin were
   generally less variable than values based on dieldrin concentrations in
   sediments on a dry-weight basis. Ten-day LC50 values for H. azteca and
   C. tentans based on measured pore-water concentrations of dieldrin were
   greater than those based on EqP-predicted pore-water concentrations of
   dieldrin. An increase in the apparent water solubility of dieldrin as a
   result of binding to dissolved organic carbon appeared to account for
   this phenomenon. Ten-day LC50 values for H. azteca and C. tentans based
   on EqP-predicted pore-water concentrations of dieldrin were within a
   factor of 25 and 3 of their respective 10-d, water-only dieldrin LC50
   values. Avoidance of the dieldrin-spiked sediments may offer a partial
   explanation for the concentration-response results observed with H.
   azteca and the greater difference observed for this species between
   water-only and predicted pore-water 10-d LC50 values for dieldrin.
   Inhibition of growth in C. tentans was also a sensitive end point with
   effects observed at pore-water 10-d LC50 values for dieldrin. Inhibition
   of growth in C. tentans was also a sensitive end point with effects
   observed at pore-water concentrations of dieldrin as small as 5.5 mu g/g
   organic carbon. Based on these results, it appears that EqP based upon
   sediment organic carbon content is an appropriate model for converting
   WQC for dieldrin to SQC. These results also highlight the importance of
   using multiple benthic test species (including at least one infaunal
   species), end points, and sediments in SQC sediment-spiking check
   studies.}},

   positively correlated to both dissolved organic carbon and UV
   absorbance. Humic substances appear to be important complexing agents in

Abstract = {{A modified high-temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO) method for marine
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurement is described. The method has
   a high oxidation efficiency and a precision of 1-2\%. It is robust and
   relatively easy to perform, and hence can be used for routine analyses.
   Components of the system blank are determined by the use of deionized
   water treated by high-temperature catalysed oxidation, and the results
   are checked by an experiment using C-14. Extensive comparisons between
   this method and UV photo-oxidation are presented. The HTCO method
   consistently yields 5-60\% more DOC than the UV method, with most
   results in the range of 10-40\%. No simple explanation has been found
   for the differences between the two methods, as a result of the complex
   nature of DOC in seawater.}},

   During a cruise carried out in February 1987, salinity, temperature,
   turbidity, nutrients, pigments, suspended particulate matter and
   particulate carbon and nitrogen were measured in surface and subsurface
   waters near the Rhone outlet.
   For most of the parameters the results show that during this period a
   simple dilution process occurs in the river plume of the Rhone without
   adsorption, desorption, precipitation or biological uptake, contrary to
   recordings for some other rivers.  All the nutrients discharged into the

Title = {{Host and Environmental Specificity in Bacterial Communities Associated
   to Two Highly Invasive Marine Species (Genus Asparagopsis)}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{As habitats change due to global and local pressures, population
   resilience, and adaptive processes depend not only on their gene pools
   but also on their associated bacteria communities. The hologenome can
   play a determinant role in adaptive evolution of higher organisms that
   rely on their bacterial associates for vital processes. In this study,
   we focus on the associated bacteria of the two most invasive seaweeds in
   southwest Iberia (coastal mainland) and nearby offshore Atlantic
   islands, Asparagopsis taxiformis and Asparagopsis armata. Bacterial
   communities were characterized using 16S rRNA barcoding through 454 next
   generation sequencing and exploratory shotgun metagenomics to provide
   functional insights and a backbone for future functional studies. The
   bacterial community composition was clearly different between the two
   species A. taxiformis and A. armata and between continental and island
   habitats. The latter was mainly due to higher abundances of
   Acidimicrobiales, Sphingomonadales, Xanthomonadales, Myxococcales, and
   Alteromonadales on the continent. Metabolic assignments for these groups
   contained a higher number of reads in functions related to oxidative
   stress and resistance to toxic compounds, more precisely heavy metals.
   These results are in agreement with their usual association with
   hydrocarbon degradation and heavy-metals detoxification. In contrast, A.
   taxiformis from islands contained more bacteria related to oligotrophic
   environments which might putatively play a role in mineralization of
   dissolved organic matter. The higher number of functional assignments
   found in the metagenomes of A. taxiformis collected from Cape Verde
   Islands suggest a higher contribution of bacteria to compensate nutrient
   limitation in oligotrophic environments. Our results show that
   Asparagopsis-associated bacterial communities have host-specificity and
   are modulated by environmental conditions. Whether this environmental
   effect reflects the host's selective requirements or the locally
   available bacteria remains to be addressed. However, the known
   functional capacities of these bacterial communities indicate their
   potential for eco-physiological functions that could be valuable for the
   host fitness.}},

Title = {{High dissolved organic carbon release by benthic cyanobacterial mats in
   a Caribbean reef ecosystem}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{Benthic cyanobacterial mats (BCMs) are increasing in abundance on coral
   reefs worldwide. However, their impacts on biogeochemical cycling in the
   surrounding water and sediment are virtually unknown. By measuring
   chemical fluxes in benthic chambers placed over sediment covered by BCMs
   and sediment with BCMs removed on coral reefs in Curacao, Southern
   Caribbean, we found that sediment covered by BCMs released 1.4 and 3.5
   mmol Cm-2 h(-1) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during day and night,
   respectively. Conversely, sediment with BCMs removed took up DOC, with
   day and night uptake rates of 0.9 and 0.6 mmol C m(-2) h(-1). DOC
   release by BCMs was higher than reported rates for benthic algae (turf
   and macroalgae) and was estimated to represent 79\% of the total DOC
   released over a 24 h diel cycle at our study site. The high nocturnal
   release of DOC by BCMs is most likely the result of anaerobic metabolism
   and degradation processes, as shown by high respiration rates at the mat
   surface during nighttime. We conclude that BCMs are significant sources
   of DOC. Their increased abundance on coral reefs will lead to increased
   DOC release into the water column, which is likely to have negative
   implications for reef health.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{282}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectral features were
   evaluated for the elucidation of the photocatalytic degradation of sole
   humic acid (HA) and HA in the presence of clay minerals. Montmorillonite
   (Mt) or kaolinite (Kt) was selected to represent two different types of
   clay minerals. EEM fluorescence signatures displayed irradiation time
   dependent transformation of humic-like fluorophores to fulvic-like
   fluorophores in accordance with the photocatalytic mineralization of HA.
   The role of Ca2+ ions on the photocatalytic degradation of HA could also
   be visualized through EEM under the specified conditions. Upon
   photocatalytic treatment, the role of Mt was more pronounced with
   respect to the effects observed in the presence of Kt in comparison to
   the results achieved for sole HA. Under prolonged irradiation conditions
   (t(irr) = 180 min) almost complete removal of fluorophoric groups was
   detected in relation to a substantial degree of mineralization (>75\%
   removal of dissolved organic carbon, DOC). As a correlative approach,
   fluorescence-derived index defined as fluorescence intensity (Fl)
   represented by the ratio of the emission intensity at lambda(emis) = 450
   nm to that at lambda(emis) = 500 nm, following excitation at lambda(exc)
   = 370 nm was successfully employed. Fl values were correlated to
   specified UV parameters (UV254 and UV280) revealing an inverse
   relationship. Moreover, through normalization of the specified UV
   parameters to DOC contents, the derived specific UV parameters
   (SUVA(254) and SUVA(280)) could also be successfully correlated to Fl.
   The obtained results indicated that besides photocatalytic
   mineralization efficiencies, UV vis and fluorescence spectroscopic
   properties could also be employed to gain further information on the
   humic structural changes attained through non-selective oxidation
   mechanism in comparison to the data obtained under non-oxidative
   conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Studies indicate that bacterial taxa utilize different fractions of the
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool, while others suggest functional
   redundancy among constituents of bacterioplankton, implying only a weak
   coupling between community structure and function. We examined bacterial
   compositional and functional {[}ectoenzymatic activities and growth
   efficiency; bacterial growth efficiency (BGE)] responses to a gradient
   in bioavailable DOC (bDOC). This was achieved over 10 days in DOC
   utilization assays containing Baltic Sea water with variable amounts of
   natural bDOC. Measurements of bacterial growth, O-2 and DOC consumption
   in the assays using non-invasive sampling showed that BGE changed over
   time and that the bDOC utilized accounted for 4-13\% of the DOC pool.
   Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes demonstrated minor differences at the
   phylum level between samples, whereas larger successional differences
   were discernible at lower phylogenetic levels. Our study suggests that
   changes in concentrations of bDOC affect bacterioplankton BGE and
   community structure by selecting for some taxa while the relative
   abundance of most taxa remained unaffected. Ectoenzymes activities
   suggested preferential degradation of protein-rich compounds by
   bacteria, switching to carbohydrate-rich DOC when proteins were
   depleted. Hence, there was a fairly weak linkage between bacterial
   community composition and DOC utilization suggesting that overall
   bacterioplankton community structure only to some extent has predictive
   power for processing of the DOC pool.}},

Abstract = {{During the ARK XXV 1+2 expedition in the Arctic Ocean carried out in
   June-July 2010 aboard the R/V Polarstern, we measured carbon monoxide
   (CO), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and phytoplankton pigments at the
   sea surface and down to a depth of 100 m. The CO and NMHC sea-surface
   concentrations were highly variable; CO, propene and isoprene levels
   ranged from 0.6 to 17.5 nmol L-1, 1 to 322 pmol L-1 and 1 to 541 pmol
   L-1, respectively. The CO and alkene concentrations as well as their
   sea-air fluxes were enhanced in polar waters off of Greenland, which
   were more stratified because of ice melting and richer in chromophoric
   dissolved organic matter (CDOM) than typical North Atlantic waters. The
   spatial distribution of the surface concentrations of CO was consistent
   with our current understanding of CO-induced UV photoproduction in the
   sea. The vertical distributions of the CO and alkenes were comparable
   and followed the trend of light penetration, with the concentrations
   displaying a relatively regular exponential decrease down to
   non-measurable values below 50 m. However, no diurnal variations of CO
   or alkene concentrations were observed in the stratified and irradiated
   surface layers. On several occasions, we observed the existence of
   subsurface CO maxima at the level of the deep chlorophyll maximum. This
   finding suggests the existence of a non-photochemical CO production
   pathway, most likely of phytoplanktonic origin. The corresponding
   production rates normalized to the chlorophyll content were in the range
   of those estimated from laboratory experiments. In general, the vertical
   distributions of isoprene followed that of the phytoplankton biomass.
   These data support the existence of a dominant photochemical source of
   CO and light alkenes enhanced in polar waters of the Arctic Ocean, with
   a minor contribution of a biological source of CO. The biological source
   of isoprene is observed in the different water masses but significantly
   increases in the warmer Atlantic waters.}},

Title = {{Particulate-dissolved transformations as a sink for semi-labile
   dissolved organic matter: Chemical characterization of high molecular

Abstract = {{Chemical characterizations of high molecular weight dissolved organic
   matter (HMW DOM) have shown that a compositionally well-defined family
   of acylated polysaccharides (APS) contributes a large fraction of DOM in
   the surface ocean. One process that might affect APS cycling is physical
   removal by aggregation. To investigate the importance of this mechanism,
   we compared the chemical composition and transparent exopolymer particle
   (TEP) abundances of seawater HMW DOM with surface-active organic matter
   (SAOM) that accumulates as standing sea surface foam during intense wind
   events. We further simulated the aggregation of SAOM using
   bubble-adsorption of HMW DOM isolated from laboratory cultures of the
   diatom Chaetoceros neogracile. H-1-NMR spectroscopy and molecular-level
   analysis of natural and laboratory-produced HMW DOM and SAOM show
   important contributions from polysaccharides, acetate, and aliphatic
   organic matter and similar yields and distributions of neutral sugars
   after hydrolysis. Microbial degradation of Chaetoceros neogracile DOM
   removes proteins and mannose-rich polysaccharides to produce HMW DOM
   with spectral and molecular-level characteristics that resemble seawater
   APS. These results imply that APS and hydrolysable sugars are resistant
   to microbial degradation over the time frame of our degradation
   experiment (40 days). As revealed by H-1-NMR spectroscopy and by the
   neutral monosaccharide data, there are important similarities in the
   composition of APS in HMW DOM and natural and laboratory-produced SAOM
   foamy material, rich in TEP. Although these samples are operationally
   classified in two distinct pools (dissolved vs. particulate) in
   seawater, they exhibit similar chemical and spectral characteristics.
   Finally. TEP concentration measurements in SAOM samples indicate that
   freshly-produced diatom DOM yields SAOM with TEP concentration similar
   to seawater and natural SAOM, but seven times higher than SAOM produced
   after bubble-adsorption of degraded BMW DOM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Coastal conduit in southwestern Hudson Bay (Canada) in summer: Rapid
   transit of freshwater and significant loss of colored dissolved organic

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{114}},

Abstract = {{Distributions of freshwater (sea-ice melt and runoff) were investigated
   along inshore-offshore sections in southwestern Hudson Bay for fall
   conditions. Conductivity-temperature-density profiles and bottle samples
   collected for salinity, oxygen isotope (delta O-18), and colored
   dissolved organic matter (CDOM) analyses were used to discriminate
   between contributions of river water (RW) and sea-ice melt (SIM).
   Stations had a fresh summer surface mixed layer 5-25 m thick overlying a
   cold subsurface layer indicative of the previous winter's polar mixed
   layer (PML). The fraction of RW decreased strongly with distance from
   shore, while the opposite was true for SIM. The majority of RW was
   constrained in a coastal domain within 100-150 km from shore, which,
   because of high alongshore velocities, accounts for the majority of
   freshwater and volume transports. On the basis of freshwater inventories
   and composition, brine and RW accumulate in the PML over winter because
   of ice formation and downward mixing. The summer surface circulation
   results in an annual net export of SIM from the region. Residence times
   for freshwater components in the southwestern sector of the bay, based
   on currents derived from a 3-D ocean model for Hudson Bay, are about
   1-10 months, implying rapid transit of freshwater. Despite the short
   residence time for RW (1-3 months), CDOM is significantly photobleached
   and provides an unreliable tracer for RW. Photobleaching represents an
   important sink for dissolved organic carbon entering from rivers and
   could, in part, explain why Hudson Bay is only a minor sink for
   atmospheric CO2 in the open water season.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in lake water can have a harmful effect
   on algal growth through either direct toxicity or iron limitation
   induced by its complexation with iron. We assessed the effect of iron
   complexation with DOM on algal growth in the eutrophic Lake Kasumigaura,
   Japan, using 2 species of cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa and
   Planktothrix agardhii, by combining the algal growth potential (AGP)
   test and pretreatment of DOM decomposition by UV irradiation. We also
   determined which nutrient limited the growth of the 2 species in the
   lake water using the AGP test: iron limited the growth of the 2 species,
   as did nitrogen and phosphorus in Lake Kasumigaura. Moreover, the growth
   of the 2 species was inhibited by iron complexation with DOM. This is
   consistent with our results regarding iron speciation in Lake
   Kasumigaura by cathodic stripping voltammetry: most (> 99.9\%) of the
   dissolved iron was present as organic species in the lake water.
   Furthermore, data from our AGP test suggest that iron requirement or
   iron availability between the 2 species are different. This difference
   in growth characteristics between algal species would be an important
   determinant of the dominance of specific algal species.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of UV-B radiation (UVBR; 280-320 nm) on lower levels of a
   natural plankton assemblage (bacteria, phytoplankton and
   microzooplankton) from the St. Lawrence Estuary was studied during 9
   days using several immersed outdoor mesocosms. Two exposure treatments
   were used in triplicate mesocosms: natural UVBR (N treatment, considered
   as the control treatment) and lamp-enhanced UVBR (H treatment,
   simulating 60\% depletion of the ozone layer). A phytoplankton bloom
   developed after day 3, but no significant differences were found between
   treatments during the entire experiment for phytoplankton biomass
   (chlorophyll a and cell carbon) nor for phytoplankton cell abundances
   from flow cytometry and optical microscopy of three phytoplankton size
   classes (picoplankton, nanoplankton and microplankton). In contrast,
   bacterial abundances showed significantly higher values in the H
   treatment, attributed to a decrease in predation pressure due to a
   dramatic reduction in ciliate biomass (similar to 70-80\%) in the H
   treatment relative to the N treatment. The most abundant ciliate species
   were Strombidinium sp., Prorodon ovum and Tintinnopsis sp.; all showed
   significantly lower abundances under the H treatment. P. ovum was the
   less-affected species (50\% reduction in the H treatment compared with
   that of the N control), contrasting with similar to 90\% for the other
   ones. Total specific phytoplanktonic and bacterial production were not
   affected by enhanced UVBR. However, both the ratio of primary to
   bacterial biomass and production decreased markedly under the H
   treatment. In contrast, the ratio of phytoplankton to bacterial plus
   ciliate carbon biomass showed an opposite trend than the previous
   results, with higher values in the H treatment at the end of the
   experiment. These results are explained by the changes in the ciliate
   biomass and suggest that UVBR can alter the structure of the lower
   levels of the planktonic community by selectively affecting key species.
   On the other hand, linearity between particulate organic carbon (POC)
   and estimated planktonic carbon was lost during the postbloom period in
   both treatments. On the basis of previous studies, our results can be
   attributed to the aggregation of carbon released by cells to the water
   column in the form of transparent exopolymer particles (TEPs) under
   nutrient limiting conditions. Unexpectedly, POC during such a period was
   higher in the H treatment than in controls. We hypothesize a decrease in
   the ingestion of TEPs by ciliates, in coincidence with increased DOC
   release by phytoplankton cells under enhanced UVBR. The consequences of
   such results for the carbon cycle in the ocean are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In the summers of 2000, 2001 and 2002, large amounts of sticky
   mucilaginous material aggregated to form masses of impressive dimensions
   over large areas of the Adriatic Sea, particularly in its northern part.
   Aggregates differing in size were sampled by SCUBA divers and submitted
   to chemical (nutrient and organic matter concentrations) and biological
   analysis (virus, bacteria and phytoplankton abundances and bacterial
   metabolism).
   Suspended and sinking mucilaginous aggregates were biota-rich
   environments where the abundance of planktonic organisms and the
   concentration of nutrients were orders of magnitude higher than in the
   surrounding seawater. The embedded phytoplankton was mostly composed of
   diatoms, but the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax fragilis, previously reported
   in association with the aggregates, was also present. A variety of
   processes occurred within the mucilaginous aggregates which resulted in
   the transformation of the organic matter composition and lability and
   contributed to a partial degradation of mucilage. For an efficient
   degradation of mucilage, several conditions are necessary: high
   bacterial abundance and activity and an efficient recycling of nutrients
   within the aggregates. Most of these conditions, appear to change
   depending on the type and age of the aggregate.
   During the first phase of aggregation (cobwebs and ribbons), bacterial
   activities addressed the degradation of organic matter, particularly
   that of the nitrogen fraction. The degradation products were rapidly
   taken up by bacteria, supporting an increase in their abundance and
   production. In aged mucilage (clouds), the degradation processes
   decreased and the bacterial metabolism suggested the presence of new
   organic labile compounds probably due to phytoplankton production. On
   the basis of our results, stringers, generally considered the first step
   of the aggregation process, seemed to be the result of a mechanical
   disruption of other types of aggregates. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   of carbon and phosphorus in plankton microcosms containing autotrophs
   (Tetraselmis sp.), heterotrophic bacteria and herbivores (Brachionus
   plicatilis) at eight different total-P concentrations. P:C ratios of
   algae, bacteria and dissolved matter, as well as the general
   accumulation of degradable dissolved organic carbon, indicated that both
   the autotrophs and heterotrophic bacteria were P-limited in all
   microcosms. According to the theory, such coexistence should only be
   possible if bacteria have higher predation losses than algae, which was
   definitely not the case in our experiment. However, data are consistent
   with the assumption that bacteria are superior in P uptake but have a
   poor ability to retain acquired P, which would promote coexistence in a
   patchy P-supply environment resulting from nutrient regeneration by
   metazoan grazers. (C) 2003 Federation of European Microbiological

Abstract = {{{[}1] Dissolved and particulate organic carbon, bacterial biomass,
   microbial enzymatic activities (EEA: leucine aminopeptidase,
   beta-glucosidase, and alkaline phosphatase), bacterial production,
   respiration rates, and bacterial growth efficiency were determined in 10
   stations of the Ionian Sea (winter 1998-1999) with the aim of
   characterizing the recycling of biogenic carbon and phosphorus in the
   different water masses, previously identified on the basis of their
   hydrographical properties. All microbial activities decreased markedly
   with depth, with a sharp increase in the benthic boundary layer, where
   potential remineralization rates of phosphorus up to 1.03 mug P.dm(-3)
   d(-1) and bacterial carbon production of 0.078 mug C.dm(-3) d(-1) were
   recorded. Those rates were close to the surface ones; the bacterial
   growth efficiency was also around 20\%, similar to the surface value,
   sustaining the microbial food chain at the bottom. The daily hydrolysis
   of the organic carbon pool estimated by EEA varied from 0.67\% (Ionian
   Surface Water) to 0.02\% (Deep Water). Alkaline phosphatase activity was
   generally low in the intermediate and deep layers, in relation to the
   higher inorganic P content. The last facts support the hypothesis that
   deep waters of Ionian Sea, and in general of the entire Mediterranean
   basin, because of their young age, carry a larger amount of labile
   dissolved organic carbon, which reduces the need for a high recycling
   activity by bacterial community. As a matter of fact, a relatively
   higher activity per cell in carbon production rates was found in the
   deep layer where a large volume of the very recently formed Cretan Sea
   Outflow Water was present.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence of waters from the Gulf of Biscay was investigated. Pore
   waters fluoresced more intensely and exhibited red-shifted spectra
   relative to overlying seawaters. Also, a blue-shift was observed going
   from coastal to open sea sites. Results indicate that continental inputs
   of fluorescent material reach the sea bed at all sites studied. Organic
   matter (OM) modifications within sediments were also observed. In the
   uppermost layer (6 cm), fluorescence intensity and dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) concentrations decrease, followed by a red-shift in
   emission spectra with increasing depth. This may reflect the increase in
   OM molar mass due to humification. The reverse of these trends in the
   deepest sub-oxic sediments might be related to the degradation of OM
   released from the solid phase, resulting in dissolved fluorescent
   material with a relative paucity of oxygen-containing functional groups,
   A very good correlation of DOC with fluorescence was observed in all

Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated how bacteria degrade protein that is adsorbed to
   or trapped within submicron particles designed to model those particles
   produced by protists grazing on bacteria and other picoplankton. The
   structure for some of these particles is hypothesized to be similar to
   liposomes, i.e. cell-like structures with lipid bilayers surrounding an
   aqueous center. To examine the degradation of liposome-like submicron
   particles, we prepared Liposomes from phospholipids, a common
   constituent of all cellular membranes, and examined degradation of
   protein freely dissolved and in various associations with liposomes.
   Natural bacterial assemblages responded rapidly to addition of protein
   and could degrade most (92 \%) of the truly dissolved protein (not
   associated with liposomes) within 72 to 90 h even though added
   concentrations were up to 1 order of magnitude greater than natural
   levels. In spite of the capacity for rapid utilization, protein
   degradation was substantially inhibited (3-fold) by the presence of
   liposomes. Protein entrapped within the liposomes was protected the
   most, but adsorption to the outside of liposomes also decreased the
   degradability of protein. Degradation of liposomes appeared to be mainly
   due to bacteria, not heterotrophic protists. Our data support previous
   studies suggesting that labile compounds may be physically protected
   from degradation when entrapped within submicron particles. These
   results help explain the presence of dissolved membrane proteins and
   other cell wall material in the dissolved organic carbon pool of marine
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{In field experiments to study the response of intertidal flats to the
   burial of organic carbon, we loaded southern North Sea sandy sediments
   with varying amounts of starch. The loaded areas temporarily turned
   black due to sulphate-reducing degradation of the organic burden. The
   appearance and disappearance of black sediment surfaces were monitored
   over a period of 12 months by means of pore-water and particulate-matter
   analysis; organic-matter degradation was traced by delta(13)C (TOC).
   Biogeochemical data showed the duration and severity of `black-spot
   disease' to depend on the amount of organic carbon buried. Results met
   expectations in a qualitative manner; several causes of the absence of
   linear correlations between the initial organic-carbon load and DOC or
   sulphate concentrations are discussed. The critical experimental load
   that caused black spots ranged between 0.4 and 0.8 kg m(-2) C-org for a
   single organic-carbon entry. Given a situation of annually repeated
   entries, we estimate the critical load to be less than 0.4 kg m(-2)
   a(-1) C-org. Depth profiles indicate OM-caused enrichment in sulphur and
   pyritisation below 20 cm depth. This study emphasises the conditions of

   respectively. The slope of the log-linearized absorption spectra, S,
   ranged from 0.012 to 0.029 nm(-1) with a mean value of 0.019 nm(-1).
   Normalized fluorescence, excited at the same wavelengths of the

Abstract = {{In spring bacterial production rates were estimated by tritiated
   thymidine incorporation in the turbid estuaries of the rivers Scheldt
   and Elbe. Bacterial production rates in the Scheldt were 5 times higher
   than in the Elbe. In the Scheldt bacterial production rates correlated
   better with the DOC concentration than in the Elbe. Organic matter
   concentrations in the marine part of the estuaries were the same while
   in the brackish part concentrations in the Scheldt were much more
   higher. In the Scheldt, but not in the Elbe, oxygen depletion occurred
   in the maximum turbidity zone caused by bacterial growth and
   respiration. The water in the Scheldt was well-mixed while in the
   turbidity maximum of the Elbe salinity and bacterial production was
   higher near the bottom than at the surface. Nutrient concentrations in
   the Scheldt were higher than in the Elbe. Bacterial production rate
   values in the Scheldt are among the highest reported in the literature.
   The relatively high bacterial production rates in both estuaries are
   caused by a high load of waste water. Comparison of bacterial growth
   rates and water residence time suggests an intensive grazing by probably

Abstract = {{Healthy phytoplankton cells exude dissolved organic matter (DOM). In a
   model, DOM exudation is demonstrated to be a cost-effective, indirect
   means of reducing virus infection, which can be a major cause of
   phytoplankton mortality. Diffusion theory shows that for a given
   biomass, small particles will have a much higher rate of adsorption of
   solutes than will large ones. Thus colloidal viruses are far more likely
   to come into contact with bacteria than with phytoplankton if the same
   biomasses are present. Bacteria can destroy viruses in a large
   proportion of contacts. Although flagellate protozoa have lower contact
   rates with viruses, they may consume more of the viruses that they do
   encounter and they deal with larger viruses particularly effectively.
   The exuded DOM supports bacterial growth, which in turn may support
   flagellates. Even fairly low levels of exudation can maintain the
   biomass of bacteria or small flagellates required to remove >50\% of
   viruses before they have a chance to infect their host, at least for
   larger phytoplankton. High rates of virus removal may occur at the high
   exudation rates that are typical of late blooms. It is concluded that
   healthy phytoplankton cells exude DOM in order to remain healthy.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was analyzed by high temperature
   catalytic oxidation at 3 stations in the North Atlantic. The stations
   were chosen to cover a range of environments in the mixed layer, from
   coastal water in Roseway Basin on the Scotian Shelf to water from the
   seaward edge of the Scotian Slope and finally to open ocean water in the
   western Sargasso Sea. At 2 of the stations (Rose-way Basin and Slope),
   the DOC revealed in surface waters by high temperature catalytic
   oxidation appeared to be biologically labile. DOC was positively
   correlated with chlorophyll and inversely correlated with apparent
   oxygen utilization (AOU). An inverse relationship between DOC and AOU
   was also found in deep water from the open ocean. This was in agreement
   with results from earlier analyses, but the negative slope of DOC with
   AOU was less than expected from the previous measurements. A relatively
   simple picture of the lability of DOC in the mixed layer was not always
   apparent in Roseway Basin or the open ocean. Horizontal advection and
   biological patchiness in weakly stratified surface waters contributed to
   large day-to-day variations in the DOC profiles. This variability should
   be taken into account when DOC is included in models of carbon cycling
   in the upper ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Jellyfish Lake, a meromictic, marine lake in the Palau Islands, western
   Pacific Ocean, is accumulating organic matter-rich sediments (46\%
   wt/wt) below anoxic, highly sulfide bottom water.  Elemental and stable
   isotope (delta-C-13) data indicate that the sedimentary organic matter
   is primarily derived from vascular plant remains (65-90\%) and would
   form a type 2 kerogen.  A bacterial layer at the oxic-anoxic interface
   in the water column may play an important role in the rapid recycling of
   algal-derived organic matter from the highly productive surface waters.
   The major postdepositional change in the sedimentary organic matter is
   carbohydrate biodegradation, as shown by C-13 NMR.  Lignin and aliphatic
   substances are preserved in the sediments.  Dissolved organic matter in
   pore waters is primarily composed of carbohydrates, reflecting the
   degradation of sedimentary carbohydrates.  Rate constants for organic
   carbon degradation and sulfate reduction in sediments of the lake are
   about 10x lower than in other anoxic sediments.  This may reflect the
   vascular plant source and partly degraded nature of the organic matter
   reaching the sediments of the lake.
   Elemental results from sediment cores and stable isotope (delta-O-18,
   delta-C-13) studies of shells from the sediments indicate probable
   climatic or ecological fluctuations affecting the depositional
   environment of the lake between 80 and 110 yr ago.  The high
   sedimentation rate and stable environment of Jellyfish Lake make it a
   possible environment for studies of climatic fluctuations during the
   Holocene.}},

Title = {{The Transpolar Drift as a Source of Riverine and Shelf-Derived Trace
   Elements to the Central Arctic Ocean}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{A major surface circulation feature of the Arctic Ocean is the
   Transpolar Drift (TPD), a current that transports river-influenced shelf
   water from the Laptev and East Siberian Seas toward the center of the
   basin and Fram Strait. In 2015, the international GEOTRACES program
   included a high-resolution pan-Arctic survey of carbon, nutrients, and a
   suite of trace elements and isotopes (TEIs). The cruises bisected the
   TPD at two locations in the central basin, which were defined by maxima
   in meteoric water and dissolved organic carbon concentrations that
   spanned 600 km horizontally and similar to 25-50 m vertically. Dissolved
   TEIs such as Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Hg, Nd, and Th, which are generally
   particle-reactive but can be complexed by organic matter, were observed
   at concentrations much higher than expected for the open ocean setting.
   Other trace element concentrations such as Al, V, Ga, and Pb were lower
   than expected due to scavenging over the productive East Siberian and
   Laptev shelf seas. Using a combination of radionuclide tracers and ice
   drift modeling, the transport rate for the core of the TPD was estimated
   at 0.9 +/- 0.4 Sv (10(6) m(3)s(-1)). This rate was used to derive the
   mass flux for TEIs that were enriched in the TPD, revealing the
   importance of lateral transport in supplying materials beneath the ice
   to the central Arctic Ocean and potentially to the North Atlantic Ocean
   via Fram Strait. Continued intensification of the Arctic hydrologic
   cycle and permafrost degradation will likely lead to an increase in the
   flux of TEIs into the Arctic Ocean.
   Plain Language Summary A major feature of the Arctic Ocean circulation
   is the Transpolar Drift (TPD), a surface current that carries ice and
   continental shelf-derived materials from Siberia across the North Pole
   to the North Atlantic Ocean. In 2015, an international team of
   oceanographers conducted a survey of trace elements in the Arctic Ocean,
   traversing the TPD. Near the North Pole, they observed much higher
   concentrations of trace elements in surface waters than in regions on
   either side of the current. These trace elements originated from land,
   and their journey across the Arctic Ocean is made possible by chemical
   reactions with dissolved organic matter that originates mainly in Arctic
   rivers. This study reveals the importance of rivers and shelf processes
   combined with strong ocean currents in supplying trace elements to the
   central Arctic Ocean and onward to the Atlantic. These trace element
   inputs are expected to increase as a result of permafrost thawing and
   increased river runoff in the Arctic, which is warming at a rate much
   faster than anywhere else on Earth. Since many of the trace elements are
   essential building blocks for ocean life, these processes could lead to
   significant changes in the marine ecosystems and fisheries of the Arctic
   Ocean.}},

   modulated by (i) fluid contribution, (ii) thermal decomposition and pH,
   and (iii) aspects particular to the vent system. Hence, solid phase
   extracted (SPE) DOM samples collected along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR)
   were molecularly characterized via 15 Tesla Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). The molecular
   character of an oceanic DOM sample was also determined before and after
   thermal (300 degrees C) decomposition at acidic and neutral pH.
   Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that DOM composition was
   strongly influenced by fluid contribution (Mg2+ concentration between 12
   and 54 mM), which correlated positively with measured temperature
   (between 8 and 375 degrees C). In comparison, pH of the fluids (between
   2.5 and 6.9) had a minor influence. Seafloor pressure, used as a
   theoretical maximum fluid temperature at the seafloor, separated the
   fluids collected at Menez Gwen from deeper locations, due to the higher
   abundance of peptide, carboxyl-rich alicyclic (CRAM) and aromatic
   molecular formulae at Menez Gwen. Compared with seawater DOM, thermally
   decomposed DOM had on average lower molecular mass, lower O/C ratios,
   fewer double bond equivalents, and fewer CRAM formulae but higher
   aromaticity - the same molecular features displayed by MAR hydrothermal
   fluids. The study provides evidence that thermal reworking plays a major
   role in shaping DOM mixtures from hydrothermal fluids along the MAR,
   which partly represent thermally reworked marine DOM that survived
   hydrothermal circulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cysteine (Cys) plays numerous key roles in the biogeochemistry of
   natural waters. Despite its importance, a full assessment of Cys abiotic
   transformation kinetics, products and pathways under environmental
   conditions has not been conducted. This study is a mechanistic
   evaluation of the photochemical and nonphotochemical (dark)
   transformations of Cys in solutions containing chromophoric dissolved
   organic matter (CDOM). The results show that Cys underwent abiotic
   transformations under both dark and irradiated conditions. Under dark
   conditions, the transformation rates of Cys were moderate and were
   highly pH- and temperature-dependent. Under UVA or natural sunlight
   irradiations, Cys transformation rates were enhanced by up to two orders
   of magnitude compared to rates under dark conditions. Product analysis
   indicated cystine and cysteine sulfmic acid were the major
   photooxidation products. In addition, this study provides an assessment
   of the contributions of singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen
   peroxide, and triplet dissolved organic matter to the CDOM-sensitized
   photochemical oxidation of Cys. The results suggest that another unknown
   pathway was dominant in the CDOM-sensitized photo degradation of Cys,
   which will require further study to identify.}},

Title = {{Effect of crab bioturbation on organic matter processing in South West
   Atlantic intertidal sediments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{206-216}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Organic matter (OM) remineralization plays a key role in controlling the
   biogeochemistry of marine sediments. Through their burrowing activities,
   bioturbating macrofauna not only induces physical, chemical and
   biological modifications, which can affect microbial communities
   responsible for organic matter remineralization, but it could also
   directly affect the distribution and bioavailability of sedimentary
   organic matter. Through in situ experiments manipulating crab and burrow
   density in intertidal soft-bottoms, we assessed if crab-bioturbation
   affects benthic metabolism, and the amount, distribution, and
   bioavailability of sedimentary OM. Crab-bioturbation enhanced overall
   benthic metabolism and benthic flux of dissolved OM toward the water
   column at both mudflat and saltmarsh zones. Moreover, our results
   revealed that bioturbation also changes the quality, bioavailability and
   distribution of sedimentary OM in mudflats and saltmarshes. Overall,
   bioturbation enhanced the proportion of labile organic carbon of
   bioturbated sediments and homogenized the sediment column in terms of
   their proportion of labile organic carbon. However, crabs also generated
   biogenic structures (e.g., mounds) that could promote spatial
   heterogeneity of high nutritional-value OM. Bioturbation-induced changes
   on benthic metabolism and on OM availability would result in a reduction
   of the storage capacity of carbon in our intertidal systems. Previous
   works indicated that crab-burrows trap detritus and OM-rich sediments.
   Our results suggest that detritus are efficiently remineralized at
   bioturbated sediment, and finally they are quickly exported to the water
   column as CO2 and DOC. Thus, crabs are modifying the OM processing at
   intertidal soft bottoms, and the ways in which carbon is exported to
   coastal waters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prochlorococcus, the smallest but most abundant marine primary producer,
   plays an important role in carbon cycling of the global ocean. As a
   phototroph, Prochlorococcus is thought to be confined to the euphotic

   here we show for the first time the substantial presence of
   Prochlorococcus populations in the dark ocean ({''}deep
   Prochlorococcus{''} hereafter). Intensive studies at the Luzon Strait in
   the western Pacific Ocean show that the deep Prochlorococcus populations
   are exported from the euphotic zone. Multiple physical processes
   including internal solitary waves could be responsible for the
   transportation. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for picoplankton
   carbon export other than the known mechanisms such as sinking of
   phytodetritus and aggregates or grazing-mediated transportation.}},

   Relationship to iron solubility and H2O2}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{88-100}},
Abstract = {{Iron (Fe) is a limiting nutrient for phytoplankton productivity in many
   different oceanic regions. A critical aspect underlying iron limitation
   is its low solubility in seawater as this controls the distribution and
   transport of iron through the ocean. Processes which enhance the
   solubility of iron in seawater, either through redox reactions or
   organic complexation, are central to understanding the biogeochemical
   cycling of iron. In this work we combined iron solubility measurements
   with parallel factor (PARAFAC) data analysis of Coloured Dissolved
   Organic Matter (CDOM) fluorescence along a meridional transect through
   the Atlantic (PS ANT XXVI-4) to examine the hypothesis that marine humic
   fluorescence is a potential proxy for iron solubility in the surface
   ocean. PARAFAC analysis revealed 4 components (C1-4), two humic like
   substances (C2\&4) and two protein-like (C1\&3). Overall none of the 4
   components were significantly correlated with iron solubility, though
   humic-like components were weakly correlated with iron solubility in
   iron replete waters. Our analysis suggests that the ligands responsible
   for maintaining iron in solution in the euphotic zone are sourced from
   both remineralisation processes and specific ligands produced in
   response to iron stress and are not easily related to bulk CDOM
   properties. The humic fluorescence signal was sharply attenuated in
   surface waters presumably most likely due to photo bleaching, though
   there was only a weak correlation with the transient photo product H2O2,
   suggesting longer lifetimes in the photic zone for the fluorescent
   components identified here.}},

Journal = {{TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Using calculations based on the marine carbon system and on modelling,
   the sensitivity of Baltic Sea surface pH was examined. Transient
   long-term calculations demonstrated that the marine carbon system
   adjusts to lateral boundary conditions within some decades, as does
   salinity. Climate changes in temperature or salinity will only
   marginally affect the acid-base (pH) balance. Wetter or dryer climate
   will also play a minor role in the pH balance. The direct effect on
   seawater pH of acid precipitation over the Baltic Sea surface was
   demonstrated to be small. Acidification due to river transport of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the marine system seems marginal
   although mineralization of terrestrial DOC may cause extra marine
   acidification, but the effect has yet to be quantified. Increased
   nutrient load may increase the amplitude in the pH seasonal cycle and
   increase the acidification during winter time. Fossil fuel burning is
   likely to have both a direct and indirect effect through increased CO2
   levels, altering seawater pH as well as changing the river chemistry.
   This may severely threaten some species in the Baltic Sea, particularly
   in the Northern Baltic.}},

Abstract = {{Phytoplankton exopolymeric substances (EPS) contribute significantly to
   the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool in the ocean, playing crucial
   roles in the surface ocean carbon cycle. Recent studies have
   demonstrated that similar to 10\% of marine DOC can self-assemble as
   microgels through electrostatic Ca bonds providing hotspots of enriched
   microbial substrate. However, the question whether EPS can self-assemble
   and the formation mechanisms for EPS microgels have not been examined.
   Here we report that EPS from three representative phytoplankton species,
   Synechococcus, Emiliania huxleyi, and Skeletonema costatum can
   spontaneously self assemble in artificial seawater (ASW), forming
   microscopic gels of similar to 3 - 4 mu m in diameter. Different from
   the marine DOC polymers assembly, these EPS samples can self-assemble in
   Ca2+ free ASW. Further experiments from fluorescence enhancement and
   chemical composition analysis confirmed the existence of fair amounts of
   hydrophobic domains in these EPS samples. These results suggest that
   hydrophobic interactions play a key role in the assembly of EPS from
   these three species of marine phytoplankton.}},

Title = {{Degradation of sea urchin feces in a rocky subtidal ecosystem:
   implications for nutrient cycling and energy flow}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{99-108}},
Abstract = {{During destructive grazing events in the Northwest Atlantic, sea urchins
   Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis consume large amounts of kelp biomass,
   transforming this material into feces. To determine the role of urchin
   fecal material in nutrient cycling and energy flow in the shallow rocky
   subtidal zone, we monitored the physical, chemical, and microbial
   degradation of urchin feces at 6, 9, 12, and 16 m depth over 19 d at a
   wave-exposed site on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia by quantifying
   changes in fecal biochemical composition, pellet size, and settling
   velocity. We observed an exponential loss of fecal material and rapid
   degradation of total and labile organic matter fractions; this suggests
   that urchin fecal production plays an important role in local nutrient
   cycling and energy flow via the microbial food web. As the feces were
   further degraded there was a relative increase in organic carbon,
   nitrogen, lipid, and available energy content, and a decrease in the C:N
   ratio, suggesting that degraded urchin feces are an important food
   source for suspension- and deposit-feeding invertebrates. The settling
   velocity of the feces also decreased over time, likely due to a decrease
   in fecal pellet density. Older, less dense feces with a relatively high
   energy content are more likely to be suspended and transported
   horizontally, providing a mechanism for the export of kelp primary
   production to deeper, less productive waters.}},

Abstract = {{A 20 d seawater mesocosm experiment was conducted to study microbial
   loop and carbon cycling dynamics in 3 experimental systems of different
   trophic status. Two mesocosms were supplemented with phytoplankton
   (Phaeocystis in one mesocosm and diatoms in another). This report
   details the variations in bacterial community composition and in carbon
   utilization potential investigated via assays measuring the hydrolysis
   of complex polysaccharides and a simple peptide compound. The first half
   of the study period was dominated by bacterial growth and large shifts
   in community composition coinciding with utilization of the organic
   carbon present at the beginning of the experiment, as shown by
   hydrolysis of specific polysaccharides and drawdown of labile dissolved
   organic carbon. During the second half of the experiment,
   bacterioplankton abundance, composition, and enzymatic activities
   changed in response to the experimental treatments. Multiple correlation
   analyses implicated co-variation between rRNA gene DGGE phylotypes (e.g.
   Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) and
   specific combinations of environmental parameters and carbon resources,
   indicating phylotypic specialization to the experimental mesocosm
   conditions. Similarly, hydrolysis of 3 polysaccharides (xylan,
   chondroitin, and Isochrysis extract) correlated significantly with
   particular phylotypes, providing evidence of species-specific influences
   on carbon utilization that varied temporally over the experiment period.
   Aminopeptidase activity mirrored biomass accumulation, as indicated by
   positive correlations (>0.80) with most biomass indicators determined.
   These results illustrate that combined molecular and biochemical
   analysis of active microbial communities can illuminate linkages between
   specific organisms and important ecosystem processes such as carbon
   utilization. Additionally, our findings show that trophic status was
   reflected in community composition and carbon utilization activities.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) produced during
   the onset, development and decay of a simulated bloom of the marine
   diatom Skeletonema costatum to complex free copper has been followed for
   a 2 week period. Copper binding capacity of the culture was measured by
   anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) with a hanging mercury drop electrode
   (HMDE). The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and two
   fluorophores, M (humic-like, Ex/Em: 320 nm/410 nm) and T (protein-like,
   Ex/Em: 280 nm/350 nm), were followed during the course of the
   incubation. Models using DOC concentrations alone could not accurately
   predict the complexing capacity of the culture, especially at the end of
   the bloom, and better predictions were obtained when fluorescence
   measurements were considered. They were helpful in charactenising two
   types of copper ligands produced in the culture. The first type, traced
   by the fluorescence of peak T, was related to labile DOC directly exuded
   by phytoplankton. The second type, traced by the fluorescence of peak M,
   was the refractory humic-like material presumably produced in situ as a
   by-product of the bacterial degradation of phyrogenic materials. During
   the onset and development of the bloom (days 0 to 7), the fluorescence
   of peak T explains 60-80\% of the total complexing capacity of the
   culture, suggesting that exuded ``protein-like{''} compounds among other
   exuded complexing agents efficiently complexed free copper. On the
   contrary, during the decay (days 8 to 13), these ligands were replaced
   by humic substances as the complexing agent for copper. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that the appearance of mucilage in the Northern
   Adriatic Sea was related with the accumulation of dissolved organic
   compounds released by intensive enzymatic activities and not utilized as
   direct substrate for microbial growth. To do this enzymatic activities
   and dissolved organic and inorganic pools in periods characterized by
   the presence of mucilage and in the same seasons but in absence of
   mucilage were compared. Extracellular enzymatic activities
   (aminopeptidase, beta-glucosidase and alkaline phosphatase), nutrient
   pool concentrations (total dissolved nitrogen, dissolved organic
   nitrogen, total dissolved phosphorus, dissolved organic phosphorus) and
   the biochemical composition of particulate and dissolved organic matter
   (in terms of proteins and carbohydrates) were determined on a monthly
   basis over a period of 3 years. Aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase
   activities displayed higher values in springs preceding the appearance
   of mucilage than in spring when no mucilage was observed. P-Glucosidase
   activity showed significantly higher values in summer periods
   characterized by the massive production of mucilage than in summers
   without mucilage events. The months preceding mucilage events were also
   characterized by an increase of the alkaline phosphatase to
   aminopeptidase activity ratio and by a significant accumulation of
   dissolved proteins. These findings, together with the significant
   increase of the DON/DOP ratio, suggest that mucilage formation is
   favoured by the deficiency of organic P. The present study provides
   compelling evidences that mucilage formation is favoured by the
   unbalance between organic matter mobilization by enzymatic activities
   and the accumulation of labile dissolved organic-N compounds. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The decomposition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in pelagic
   ecosystems is mediated primarily by heterotrophic bacteria, but
   transformation by short-wave solar radiation may play an important role
   in surface waters, in particular when humic substances constitute a
   substantial fraction of the DOM pool. Most of the studies examining
   bacterial decomposition and photochemical transformation of DOM stem
   from limnetic and coastal marine systems and much less information is
   available from oceanic environments. To examine the bacterial
   decomposition of humic and non-humic DOM in the Southern Ocean we
   carried out microcosm experiments in which we measured bacterial growth
   on isolated fractions of humic and non-humic DOM of the size classes < 3
   kDa and > 3 kDa. Experiments carried out at the Polar Front showed a
   preferential bacterial growth on non-humic DOM and in particular on the
   size fraction < 3 kDa. Bacterial growth, measured as bacterial biomass
   production, on non-humic DOM accounted for 74\% to 88\% of the total
   growth on all four DOM fractions. In experiments in the Antarctic
   circumpolar current and the coastal current under pack ice, bacterial
   growth was 6x lower than at the Polar Front, and humic and non-humic DOM
   was consumed to equal amounts. The size fraction < 3 kDa was always
   preferred. Experiments examining the effect of solar radiation on the
   release of dissolved amino acids (DAA) and carbohydrates (DCHO) and
   their subsequent bacterial utilization showed a stimulating effect on
   glucose uptake and the release of DAA at the Polar Front but an
   inhibition in the eastern Weddell Sea. Ultraviolet-B was the most
   effective component of the solar radiation spectrum tested. Effects of
   UV-B on glucose uptake and release of DAA were positively correlated
   with concentrations of humic-bound DAA. The data imply that at low
   concentrations, e.g., < 100 nM (amino acid equivalent), UV-irradiation
   reduces, whereas at concentrations > 100 nM UV-irradiation stimulates
   glucose uptake and release of DAA as compared to dark conditions.}},

   Gulf of Mexico in 2000 and 2001. A strong positive correlation between
   APS concentration and cyanobacteria abundance was found in 2000. In
   2001, prymnesiophyte abundance correlated well with both concentrations
   of APS and URA. Bacterial production data, measured simultaneously in
   2001, showed significant positive relationships with particulate organic
   carbon (POC), CHO, APS and URA concentrations, respectively. The average
   fluxes out of the euphotic zone of CHO, APS and URA in 2000 were 8.1,
   1.3, and 0.7 mg C m(-2) d(-1), respectively. In 2001, the average fluxes
   of CHO, APS and URA were about 3 times higher than those in 2000, which
   was a time of lower nutrient concentrations, indicating that the fluxes
   of carbohydrate species are related to the nutrient status and
   phytoplankton composition. The results suggest that APS in the upper
   water column can be produced by cyanobacteria, prymnesiophytes, and
   heterotrophic bacteria. Most importantly, our data indicate that APS and
   CHO compounds are more resistant to biological degradation than other
   organic compounds, suggesting that the role of CHO compounds in carbon
   cycling in the ocean is more complex than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Hovsgol is a large tectonic lake located in northern Mongolia,
   which has extremely transparent lake water. In our survey, the dissolved
   organic carbon of the lake water was 80-100 muM-C, and the fluorescence
   intensity in an excitation and emission matrix was very low. The brown
   color and high content of humic substances in river water flowing from a
   watershed consisting of grassland and forests rapidly declined in the
   coastal area of the lake. The decrease in humic content may be due not
   only to dilution by the lake water but also to flocculation and
   photo-bleaching. Among tectonic lakes in Asia, Lake Hovsgol would appear
   to have unique biological and hydrological features that reduce humic
   content and help to maintain water transparency.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The bacterioplankton of the marine and brackish water zones of the
   complex system Ria de Aveiro was characterized as profiles of bacterial
   abundance and biomass productivity. During the warm season, total
   bacteria ranged from 0.2 to 8.5 x 10(9) cells L(-1) and active bacteria
   number from 0.1 to 3.1 x 10(9) cells L(-1). Total and active bacterial
   numbers were, on average, three times higher in brackish than in marine
   water. Bacterial productivity on different dates and different tides in
   the marine zone varied from 0.05 to 4.5 mug C L(-1) h(-1). Here the
   average productivity (1.1 mug C L(-1) h(-1)) was 3.5 times less than in
   brackish water (average 3.8 mug C L(-1) h(-1); range 0.7-14.2 mug C
   L(-1) h(-1)). Specific productivity varied from 0.05 to 2.61 fg C
   cell(-1) h(-1), a range that was similar throughout the ecosystem.
   However, specific productivity per active cell was 19\% higher in
   brackish water. Bacterial production variation was best explained by the
   number of active bacteria, which, in turn, was highly associated with
   total bacterial number, temperature, and particulate organic carbon. In
   the marine zone, bacterial production was also influenced by depth and
   salinity. In the brackish zone, the set of independent variables
   explained a smaller percentage of bacterial production variation than in
   marine zone, suggesting greater importance of other variables. In the
   marine zone, and mainly near low tide, productivity was significantly
   higher (average 3.3 times) at the surface (down to 0.5 m) than in the
   deeper layers of the water column. This stratification of bacterial
   productivity was linked to the increased specific productivity per
   active cell, as no modification in the proportion of active cells in the
   population could be detected. The vertical profile of bacterial
   production in the deeper zone of this estuarine ecosystem, in which no
   clear salinity or thermal stratification occurs throughout the tidal
   cycle, seemed to reflect a biochemical stratification generated by
   increased phytoplankton exudation and/or by photochemical transformation
   of semilabile or recalcitrant organic compounds. Shallower water masses
   tend to blur this surface effect. The relative importance of
   photochemical transformation in the pattern of estuarine bacterial
   production will therefore tend to vary with the bathymetry of the
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Phytoplankton blooms were created in freshwater enclosures to study the
   functional succession and diversification for attached (>10 mum size
   fraction) and free-living (<10 <mu>m size fraction) assemblages of
   bacteria, Bacterial dynamics in abundance, production and enzyme
   activity was monitored by standard methods. The functional diversity
   with respect to sole carbon source utilization was assessed with Biolog
   GN plates inoculated with bacteria from the 2 size fractions. Moreover,
   bacterial isolates were screened for enzyme activity involved in the
   degradation of carbohydrates, chitin, protein and lipid. As the bloom
   proceeded, the functional diversity of attached and free-living bacteria
   appeared to be very similar. Most functional groups present in the
   free-living bacterial assemblage were also recovered attached to
   particulate matter. Additionally, the distribution of bacterial isolates
   with enzyme expression was similar with respect to 6 enzymes (p > 0.07),
   whereas 3 glucoside-bond cleaving enzymes were more frequent among the
   free-living isolates (p < 0.02). These results indicate that attached
   and free-living bacteria were functionally closely related and that
   their succession tended to converge during the phytoplankton bloom.
   Hence, bacteria attached to particulate matter are not necessarily
   functionally distinct and specialized for polymer hydrolysis relative to
   the free-living assemblage, though they are often anticipated to be
   different due to their close association with particulate polymers.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of irradiance in the range of 400 to 700 nm or
   photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on bacterial heterotrophic
   production estimated by the incorporation of H-3-leucine (referred to
   herein as Leu) was investigated in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea
   and in a coastal North Atlantic site, with Leu uptake rates ranging over
   3 orders of magnitude. We performed in situ incubations under natural
   irradiance levels of Mediterranean samples taken from five depths around
   solar noon and compared them to incubations in the dark. In two of the
   three stations large differences were found between light and dark
   uptake rates for the surfacemost samples, with dark values being on
   average 133 and 109\% higher than in situ ones. Data obtained in coastal
   North Atlantic waters confirmed that dark enclosure may increase Leu
   uptake rates more than threefold. To explain these differences, on-board
   experiments of Leu uptake versus irradiance were performed with
   Mediterranean samples from depths of 5 and 40 In. Incubations under a
   gradient of 12 to 1,731 mu mol of photons m(-2) s(-1) evidenced a
   significant increase in incorporation rates with increasing PAR in most
   of the experiments, with dark-incubated samples departing from this
   pattern. These results were not attributed to inhibition of Leu uptake
   in the light but to enhanced bacterial response when transferred to dark
   conditions. The ratio of dark to light uptake rates increased as
   dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations decreased, suggesting that
   bacterial nutrient deficiency was overcome by some process occurring
   only in the dark bottles.}},
